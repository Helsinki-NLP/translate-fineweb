| The workplace can be a complex environment, with numerous laws and regulations that govern the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers. In Canada, the legal framework that governs employment relationships is known as status law. Status law covers a wide range of issues, from hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety. Understanding these laws is critical for employees, who can use this information to protect their rights and advocate for themselves in the workplace. This guide will provide a brief overview of some of the most common law cases in Canada.<br/>Hiring and Termination:<br/>One of the most important aspects of status law is the hiring process. Employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws and ensure that they do not make hiring decisions based on factors such as race, gender, age, or religion. Once an employee has been hired, the employer is also required to follow specific procedures if they decide to terminate the employee. By Law includes providing the employee with adequate notice, or paying them severance if the termination is without cause. best employment lawyer Toronto can advise about it.<br/>Discrimination and Harassment:<br/>Another critical aspect of status law is protecting employees from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfairly based on a personal characteristic, such as race, gender, age, or religion. Harassment is any behavior that creates a hostile or offensive working environment. In both cases, employees have the right to file a complaint with their employer or with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.<br/>Wages and Hours of Work:<br/>Status law also regulates the wages and hours of work for employees. Employers must comply with minimum wage laws and ensure that employees receive the appropriate overtime pay for any hours worked over the standard workweek. In addition, employers must provide employees with breaks and time off for holidays, vacations, and sick leave.<br/>Finally, status law requires employers to maintain a safe working environment for their employees. This includes providing adequate training, equipment, and safety protocols to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. Employees have the right to refuse work if they believe it is unsafe, and employers must investigate and address any safety concerns raised by employees and represented by the best employment lawyer in Toronto.<br/>In conclusion, understanding the common cases in Canadian status law is essential for employees to navigate the workplace and protect their rights. From hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety, employees need to be aware of the laws that govern their employment relationship. If employees have any questions or concerns, they can seek advice from a lawyer or consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. By knowing their rights and responsibilities, employees can ensure a fair and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues. | Работното място може да бъде сложна среда, с множество закони и разпоредби, които уреждат правата и отговорностите на служителите и работодателите. В Канада правната рамка, която урежда трудовите правоотношения, е известна като закон за статута. Законът за статута обхваща широк спектър от въпроси, от наемането и прекратяването до дискриминацията и безопасността на работното място. Разбирането на тези закони е от решаващо значение за служителите, които могат да използват тази информация, за да защитят правата си и да се застъпят за себе си на работното място. Това ръководство ще предостави кратък преглед на някои от най-често срещаните случаи на право в Канада.<br/>Наемане и прекратяване:<br/>Един от най-важните аспекти на закона за статута е процесът на наемане. Работодателите трябва да спазват антидискриминационните закони и да гарантират, че те не вземат решения за наемане въз основа на фактори като раса, пол, възраст или религия. След като служителят е бил нает, работодателят също е длъжен да следва конкретни процедури, ако реши да прекрати служителя. По закон включва осигуряване на подходящо предизвестие на служителя или изплащане на обезщетение, ако прекратяването е без причина. Най-добрият адвокат по трудово право в Торонто може да ви посъветва за това.<br/>Дискриминация и тормоз:<br/>Друг критичен аспект на закона за статута е защитата на служителите от дискриминация и тормоз на работното място. Дискриминацията възниква, когато служителят е третиран несправедливо въз основа на лична характеристика, като раса, пол, възраст или религия. Тормоз е всяко поведение, което създава враждебна или обидна работна среда. И в двата случая служителите имат право да подадат жалба до своя работодател или до Канадската комисия по правата на човека.<br/>Заплати и работно време:<br/>Работодателите трябва да спазват законите за минималната работна заплата и да гарантират, че служителите получават съответното заплащане за извънреден труд за всички отработени часове през стандартната работна седмица. В допълнение, работодателите трябва да предоставят на служителите почивки и почивни дни за почивки, ваканции и отпуск по болест.<br/>И накрая, законът за статута изисква работодателите да поддържат безопасна работна среда за своите служители. Това включва осигуряване на подходящо обучение, оборудване и протоколи за безопасност за предотвратяване на злополуки и наранявания на работното място. Служителите имат право да откажат работа, ако смятат, че е опасна, и работодателите трябва да разследват и да се справят с всички опасения за безопасността, повдигнати от служителите и представени от най-добрия адвокат по заетостта в Торонто.<br/>В заключение, разбирането на често срещаните случаи в канадския закон за статута е от съществено значение за служителите да се ориентират на работното място и да защитават правата си. От наемането и прекратяването до дискриминацията и безопасността на работното място, служителите трябва да са наясно със законите, които управляват техните трудови правоотношения. Ако служителите имат някакви въпроси или притеснения, те могат да потърсят съвет от адвокат или да се консултират с Канадската комисия по правата на човека. Познавайки своите права и отговорности, служителите могат да осигурят справедлива и безопасна работна среда за себе си и своите колеги. |
| There's an old adage in the auto industry that says your vehicle loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot. The computer and technology industry is not so different, in that new parts and systems are constantly pushing the envelope of performance and value, making it impossible to have a top-of-the-line system for very long. The purpose of this paper is to step back in time 10 years and examine the technology landscape then to see how it compares to today's technologies we know and love.<br/>Much has been written, and much is still debated about the technology axiom called; Moore's Law. Some people interpret the law to mean a doubling of computer power every 18 months to 2 years, while others maintain it means a doubling of the numbers of transistors (microscopic on / off switches if you will) engineers are able to print into the same amount of silicon. In fact Moore stated that transistor counts would double every year, which he later adjusted to be every 2 years) Regardless, this trend of performance and transistor growth has held true for over 40 years.<br/>More recently, Moore's law has been applied to graphics processing units (GPUs) as well. The GPU is actually not even 10 years old at the time of writing. The official term GPU was coined with the nVidia GeForce 256 series of 3D cards. Released in August 1999, this was the first chip that was able to compute vertex transformations and pixel lighting in hardware. Since its release, graphics processing power has followed a similar trend of doubling performance every 18 months to 2 years. This article is not a technical document, rather a glimpse into the past 10 years ago to give you an idea of how far we've come in such a short time.<br/>A Little History About the Author:<br/>The year was 1999. It was my sophomore / junior year in high school. Now I'll pause so that 90% of the readers who grow up in the 70s and 80's can turn up their nose and stop reading.<br/>Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's continue.<br/>I am an internet child. I got into computers, and all manner of electronic geekery just as the Internet was becoming something that "just might catch on". My high school was not quite on the boring edge of technology as it was, but we were one of the first public schools in my area to be equipped with a full T1 line and the 1.5Mbps of awesome dedicated bandwidth that it piped through the network . Our network was built from a hodge-podge mixture of nice PC computers labs (mostly K6 200MHz / Win 95 machines), and a network engineers nightmare concoction of Macintoshes; LC II's up through new G3 iMacs.<br/>In 1999 I was still rocking a 486 DX-33 PC with 8MB of ram and Windows 3.11 as my PC at home, while my parents had a nice Pentium 100 Windows 95 machine my siblings and I would fight for time on. So what was the point of those last couple paragraphs you're probably asking? Well, that is where I was, and what I was using 10 years ago in computing, and hopefully it got you thinking back a decade to what you were computing on.<br/>10 years ago today, The computer world was working itself into a frenzy, getting ready for the near future release of the brand new Intel Pentium III Processor. The best money could do was a Pentium II processor at 450MHz with PC100 Memory. Rival AMD was doing alright for itself peddling its budget conscious K6-2 series of processors. Your average computer cost around $ 2000- $ 2500 at this time for a PC with a solid Pentium II processor. The Pentium III was due to be released on February 26th, and was the subject of a wicked debate over the merits of its built in unique ID number. Also noteworthy was its inclusion of the first SSE instruction set (The modern Core i7 processor is at SSE4 +). However without software designed to make use of the new instructions the processor was not much faster than an equivalent clocked Pentium II CPU and took quite a bit of heat from the press.<br/>On the graphics front the war between nVidia and 3DFx was raging. nVidia, a relative newcomer to the field, was riding high on top of their very successful TNT (Twin-Texel) video processor, while 3DFx was fighting to retain its market leadership title with its Voodoo3 line of graphics cards. The Voodoo cards were excellent performers, however the TNT cards had the advantage of 32 bit color while the Voodoo's were stuck at 24 bits. ATI was around and kicking with their Rage series of 3D cards (especially popular as integrated chips in servers and workstations), however they never really entered into the hardcore 3D accelerator race until the Radeon line debuted in 2000.<br/>In 1999 the internet boom was just beginning and attracting massive amounts of attention and investment capital from all over the globe. The big business of the time was in the search and portal business. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and Lycos were perhaps the most recognizable and capable players in this industry. Google -say-wha? Other companies from other industries, such as television media, and ISPs were taking notice, and buying up internet portals right and left in an attempt to tap into the viral spread of the internet. New technologies like Java were coming into their own, and began to lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. Studies determined that by 1999 about half of US households had a computer, and most of the new computer purchases were being made to get online.<br/>PDA's were quickly becoming the new must have gadget. The Palm Pilot being the device that led the charge. I myself had a Palm IIIe toward the later half of 2000. Personal pagers were still hot sellers, but cell phones were getting smaller and more practical and affordable. Also a war was heating up in the computer memory segment. Samsung introduced new DDR memory chips that promised to double the effective bandwidth of existing memory chips in future setups, however Rambus was busy developing their own high speed RAM for use in high end Intel systems.<br/>This field is possibly a bit too large to cover here, but a brief OS recap: The PC world was running strong with windows 98, and anxiously awaiting the updated Windows 98 Second Edition due out in May 1999. The Macintosh crowd was plugging away happily on their Mac OS 8.5 Machines, while awaiting an update to OS 9 sometime later that year. Linux was also starting to come into its own, as big name vendors like IBM were starting to bundle distributions of Redhat, Caldera, and others with some servers.<br/>I'll admit this article was more for my amusement and reminiscing than anything else. I hope that somewhere in the course of this mass of words and broken sentences, you too had some good recollections of computer equipment past. It's good to remember the technologies we grow up with and we are fortunately enough to have the robust internet we are used to today to help conjure up images and technical specs of those glory days. Sites like the Tech Time Machine exist to help us relive those days, and have a few chuckles at equipment we thought we'd never use to its full potential. I remember touching a Pentium 200MMX machine for the first time and being in awe at its raw speed and seemingly infinite possibilities. Now I constantly get upset with the speed of my current 3GHz dual core Athlon X2 6000+ PC. I can not even imagine how many windows that Pentium 200 would have thrown out of today. It's a crazy world we live in. | Има една стара поговорка в автомобилната индустрия, която казва, че вашият автомобил губи стойност веднага щом го изгоните от партидата. Компютърната и технологичната индустрия не са толкова различни, тъй като новите части и системи непрекъснато натискат обвивката на производителността и стойността, което прави невъзможно да има най-добрата система за много дълго време. Целта на тази статия е да се върнем 10 години назад във времето и да изследваме технологичния пейзаж, за да видим как той се сравнява с днешните технологии, които познаваме и обичаме.<br/>Много е написано и все още се спори за технологичната аксиома, наречена Закон на Мур. Някои хора интерпретират закона като удвояване на компютърната мощност на всеки 18 месеца до 2 години, докато други твърдят, че това означава удвояване на броя на транзисторите (микроскопични превключватели за включване / изключване, ако щете) инженерите са в състояние да печатат в същото количество силиций. Всъщност Мур заявява, че броят на транзисторите ще се удвоява всяка година, което той по-късно коригира, за да бъде на всеки 2 години) Независимо от това, тази тенденция на производителност и растеж на транзистора се запазва повече от 40 години.<br/>Съвсем наскоро законът на Мур се прилага и за графични процесори (GPU). GPU всъщност не е дори на 10 години по време на писането. Официалният термин GPU е въведен с nVidia GeForce 256 серия от 3D карти. Издаден през август 1999 г., това е първият чип, който е в състояние да изчисли върховите трансформации и пикселното осветление в хардуера. От пускането си, мощността на графичната обработка следва подобна тенденция на удвояване на производителността на всеки 18 месеца до 2 години. Тази статия не е технически документ, а по-скоро поглед в последните 10 години, за да ви даде представа колко далеч сме стигнали за толкова кратко време.<br/>Малко история за автора:<br/>Годината беше 1999. Това беше моята второкурсничка / прогимназиална година в гимназията. Сега ще направя пауза, така че 90% от читателите, които растат през 70-те и 80-те години, да могат да обърнат носа си и да спрат да четат.<br/>Добре, сега, че е от пътя, нека да продължим.<br/>Аз съм интернет дете. Влязох в компютрите, и всякакъв вид електронни зубъри, точно както интернет се превръщаше в нещо, което "просто може да се добере". Моята гимназия не беше съвсем на скучния край на технологиите, както беше, но ние бяхме едно от първите държавни училища в моя район, които бяха оборудвани с пълна T1 линия и 1.5Mbps на страхотно посветена честотна лента, която тя тръбеше през мрежата. Нашата мрежа е изградена от смесица от добри компютърни лаборатории (най-вече K6 200MHz / Win 95 машини), и мрежа инженери кошмарен смес от Macintosh; LC II е нагоре чрез нови G3 iMacs.<br/>През 1999 г. все още люлеех компютър 486 DX-33 с 8MB овен и Windows 3.11 като мой компютър у дома, докато родителите ми имаха хубава машина Pentium 100 Windows 95, на която моите братя и сестри и аз ще се борим за време. Е, това е мястото, където бях, и това, което използвах преди 10 години в изчислителната техника, и да се надяваме, че те е накарало да се замислиш за десетилетие назад към това, на което си изчислил.<br/>Преди 10 години днес компютърният свят се задъхваше, подготвяйки се за близкото бъдещо пускане на чисто новия процесор Intel Pentium III. Най-добрите пари можеха да направят е процесор Pentium II на 450MHz с PC100 Memory. Конкурентната AMD се справяше добре сама, като продаваше своята бюджетно съзнателна серия процесори K6-2. Средният ви компютър струва около $ 2000- $ 2500 по това време за компютър със солиден процесор Pentium II. Pentium III трябваше да бъде пуснат на 26 февруари и беше обект на порочен дебат относно достойнствата на вградения в него уникален идентификационен номер. Също така забележително беше включването му в първия набор от инструкции за SSE (Модерният процесор Core i7 е на SSE4 +). Въпреки това без софтуер, предназначен да се възползва от новите инструкции процесорът не е много по-бърз от еквивалентен часовник Pentium II CPU и отнема доста топлина от пресата.<br/>На графичния фронт бушува войната между nVidia и 3DFx. nVidia, относителен новодошъл на терена, се движеше високо на върха на много успешния си видео процесор TNT (Twin-Texel), докато 3DFx се бореше да запази лидерската си позиция на пазара със своята Voodoo3 линия графични карти. Вуду картите бяха отлични изпълнители, но TNT картите имаха предимството на 32-битов цвят, докато Voodoo бяха залепени на 24 бита. ATI бяха наоколо и ритаха със своите Rage серии от 3D карти (особено популярни като интегрирани чипове в сървъри и работни станции), но те никога не влязоха в хардкор 3D ускорител състезанието, докато Radeon линията дебютира през 2000 г.<br/>През 1999 г. интернет бумът едва започва и привлича огромни количества внимание и инвестиционен капитал от цял свят. Големият бизнес по това време е в бизнеса с търсене и портал. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite и Lycos бяха може би най-разпознаваемите и способни играчи в тази индустрия. Други компании от други индустрии, като телевизионните медии и доставчиците на интернет услуги, са обръщали внимание и са изкупували интернет портали надясно и наляво в опит да се включат в вирусното разпространение на интернет. Нови технологии като Java навлизат в свои ръце и започват да полагат основите на интернет такъв, какъвто го познаваме днес. Проучванията установяват, че до 1999 г. около половината от американските домакинства имат компютър и повечето от новите компютърни покупки се правят, за да се качат онлайн.<br/>PDA-тата бързо се превърнаха в новата трябва да има притурка. Palm Pilot е устройството, което доведе заряда. Аз самият имах Palm IIIe към по-късната половина на 2000. Личните пейджъри все още били горещи продавачи, но мобилните телефони ставали все по-малки и по-практични и достъпни. Samsung представи нови DDR чипове памет, които обещаха да удвоят ефективната честотна лента на съществуващите чипове памет в бъдещи настройки, но Рамбус беше зает с разработването на собствена високоскоростна RAM за използване във висок клас Intel системи.<br/>Това поле вероятно е малко прекалено голямо, за да се покрие тук, но кратко резюме на операционната система: Светът на PC работи силно с Windows 98 и с нетърпение очаква актуализираното Windows 98 Second Edition, което трябва да излезе през май 1999 г. Тълпата Macintosh се включваше щастливо на своите Mac OS 8.5 Machines, докато чакаше актуализация на OS 9 по-късно същата година. Линукс също започва да излиза на пазара, тъй като големи имена като IBM започват да обединяват дистрибуции на Redhat, Caldera и други с някои сървъри.<br/>Ще призная, че тази статия беше повече за мое забавление и спомени от всичко друго. Надявам се, че някъде в хода на тази маса от думи и счупени изречения, вие също сте имали някои добри спомени на компютърна техника миналото. Добре е да помним технологиите, с които израстваме, и за щастие имаме достатъчно здрав интернет, с който сме свикнали днес, за да помогнем за създаването на изображения и технически характеристики на тези славни дни. Сайтове като Tech Time Machine съществуват, за да ни помогнат да преживеем отново онези дни, и имат няколко подсмихвания на оборудване, което мислехме, че никога няма да използваме в пълния си потенциал. Спомням си, че докоснах Pentium 200MMX машина за първи път и бях в страхопочитание със суровата си скорост и привидно безкрайни възможности. Сега постоянно се разстройвам от скоростта на сегашния ми 3GHz двуядрен Athlon X2 6000+ PC. Дори не мога да си представя колко прозорци би изхвърлил Пентиум 200 днес. |
| The cultural anthropology major and minor offer a holistic understanding of human diversity. By exploring, analyzing, and understanding patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors, shared histories, language, visual representations and material realities, cultural anthropology focuses on what it means to be human. Our courses address relevant concerns such as food and nutrition; urban, rural, and global adaptive strategies; environmental sustainability; and economic development. Through its comparative and engaged field research methods, cultural anthropology recognizes culture as the primary means by which humans engage in social and environmental interactions to define meaningful and purposeful lives. Cultural anthropology complements well all other undergraduate majors.<br/>Top 3 Skills Learned<br/>- Critical thinking<br/>- Qualitative research methods<br/>- Partnership & collaboration with community<br/>Usually this happens toward the end of the Introduction to Anthropology course, when you realize that anthropology opens doors to new ways of looking at relevant problems in our world. It give you a big picture approach that liberates you from assumptions that there only a few answers to life's enduring questions. Ethnographic research helps you recognize your own humanity as a common condition and grow your hearts to care more deeply for others.

| Fact or Myth: Sodium Raises Blood Pressure<br/>Well, Matt, it turns out a high sodium diet might not raise blood pressure, nor have any sort of adverse effect on cardiovascular health at all. But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence (and there is more evidence that says it doesn’t than does).<br/>The debate over eating too much salt has been around since the 1960s. Almost every major governmental health organization embraces the idea that eating too much salt is damaging to your health. Most major news outlets report on these recommendations and people tend to try and follow them. This is most likely why most of us, especially the elderly with heart problems, know to reduce the amount of salt we eat. Those of us who like the idea that any recommendation be backed up by solid evidence, have to step back on this one. As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.<br/>So why have most health organizations pushed the idea of low sodium diets? The theory behind their supposition is sound, and there are some studies that show a minor risk of elevated blood pressure with extremely high salt intake. Unfortunately, there are many other studies that show no increase, and still some that show reducing salt intake might actually raise your blood pressure! Let’s look at the controversy in more detail.<br/>The idea salt will increase your blood pressure has to do with osmotic pressure. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell walls), from areas of lower solute concentration (in this case salt) to areas of higher solute concentration. This naturally equalizes the solute concentration on both sides of the membrane. (This osmotic pressure is also why salt can be used to preserves meat.)<br/>So the theory goes that when we eat too much salt, our bloodstream has more sodium in it than the surrounding areas of our body. This causes the water in those areas to be pulled into our bloodstream. The increase in water within the arteries and veins causes an increase in the pressure within those arteries and veins. The salt itself also acts like an irritant within the arteries causing them to constrict. This too is thought to increase your blood pressure.<br/>The theory seems, on the surface, very sound. After all, we can make the process of salt pulling water through membranes happen time and time again in the lab. The question is, does this actually happen within our bodies, and does this actually cause long term hypertension (high blood pressure)?<br/>In 1969, Lewis Dahl testified before Sen. George McGovern’s “select committee on nutrition and human needs”. He was concerned about the high concentrations of sodium in baby foods and thought this might cause increase in people’s blood pressure long term. His reasoning was that studies done on rats showed increases in the blood pressure of the rats.<br/>The conversation about salt and hypertension began to circulate among health organizations. The National Institutes of Health, in 1972, began introducing “High Blood Pressure Education Programs”. As their evidence, they pointed out observationally, populations who ate very little sodium had low incidents of high blood pressure. They also pointed to the rat modeling. Scientists at the time questioned this, as the rat studies had them eating 60 times what the average person does. They also pointed out the populations who ate low sodium diets, also ate low amounts of other things, like sugar (which also affects osmosis).<br/>Despite their objections, publicly, the idea of high sodium diets causing high blood pressure was here to stay, and remains today. The Centers For Disease Control, The National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and many other organizations currently promote low sodium diets.<br/>Despite the seemingly unified front presented by these distinguished organizations, the controversy among scientists is extremely heated. In 1998, award winning author Taubes, published “The Political Science of Salt” in the Journal of Science. He stated, “The controversy over the benefits, if any, of salt reduction now constitutes one of the longest running most vitriolic and surreal disputes in all of medicine.”<br/>One surgeon general in a report wrote, the speed with which US federal agencies embraced sodium reduction, “stood in stark contrast to how long it had taken for recommendations to emerge on the importance of reducing blood cholesterol levels”. He also noted that the difference was even more remarkable considering the absence of published research that actually tested the theory. On the flip-side, Sir Micheal Rawlings, the chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, who promotes salt reduction diets argued that, “Guidance (in policy making) is based on the best available evidence. The evidence may not, however, be very good and is rarely complete.” Not a very strong argument for reducing salt intake.<br/>Let’s look at a few relatively recent studies. In 2008, Italian researchers began publishing the results from a series of clinical trials, all of which reported that, among patients with heart failure, reducing salt consumption increased the risk of death. These studies were followed by others which showed among Type 1 and 2 diabetics, healthy Europeans and patients with chronic heart failure, those that ate salt at the lower limit of the normal range were more likely to have heart disease than those who ate salt in the middle range of normal.<br/>In 2011, two Cochrane reviews found no evidence that low salt diets either improved or worsened peoples’ health. They stated, “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.”<br/>Even in the face of no clear scientific evidence to support it and some to the contrary, in 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Society of Hypertension all continued to promote low sodium diets as a means of controlling high blood pressure.<br/>In the end, being a medical professional and someone who needs clear evidence to make a decision about whether I get to add copious amounts of salt on my fries, I am pleased to find that so far there is very little! All the major health organizations seem to promote low sodium diets, but none have actually published consistent studies that show low sodium diets help in health, particularly not in cardiovascular health. What I find most annoying, a pet peeve of mine, is that none of these organizations tell people that the science behind their policies is controversial and they might be flat wrong. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns, and Sandro Galea said it best in their article “Salt And Public Health”- “After a careful consideration of the debate over salt, we have concluded that the concealment of scientific uncertainty is a mistake that serves neither the ends of science nor good policy.”<br/>So you should you go out and smother everything in salt now? As with most things, if science hasn’t been able to answer the question definitively one way or the other, and you want to be safe rather than sorry, just go with the age old rule of “moderation in everything”. If you, like me, like to salt everything like the rim of a margarita glass and moderation be damned, at least now you can feel a little better about it as science seems to be leaning more and more towards low sodium diets being unnecessary and high sodium ones not being harmful at all.<br/>If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below, you might also like:<br/>- Why Salt Enhances Flavor<br/>- What Do the Numbers in a Blood Pressure Test Mean and What Do They Tell the Doctor<br/>- What Causes Arms, Legs, and Feet to “Fall Asleep”<br/>- Top 5 First Aid Tricks Everyone Should Know<br/>- How to Remove a Fresh Carpet Stain with Nothing But Salt<br/>- High blood pressure is neither a disease nor an illness in and of itself. It’s merely a risk factor for other problems. For instance, if you have chronic high blood pressure, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke goes up significantly. This high pressure could be caused by excessive plaque on the inside of your artery walls, making those arteries in effect, smaller. Think plumbing. When the pipes that transport fluid get smaller, the pressure that same volume of fluid exerts goes up. What happens if your blood pressure gets too high? I’ll answer that question with another one. What happens if the water pressure in your houses pipes gets too high? Your pipes burst. Same thing here. Should your blood pressure get too high, your arteries have a greater chance of bursting. If there is too much gunk inside your pipes (plaque inside your arteries), that ball of gunk could get too big and clog off your pipes! Seems bad too me! Especially, if those arteries are in your brain, or heart. It’s not like kidneys, where you have two! You spring a leak in those organs, and your family finally gets that big paycheck from your life insurance policy! Not really the best way to get paid, well, unless you’re really a jerk and everyone in your family hates you! Then they might not mind so much, but you certainly would.<br/>- Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury. For reference, 1 psi (pounds per square inch) is equal to 51.7149326 millimeters of mercury. If you were bleeding and wanted to stop the blood-loss with direct pressure, and you should, you would only need to use about 3 psi to stop it. Unless they have really high blood pressure, then maybe 4 psi. Basic math saves the day again!<br/>- The first known experiment to measure the exact pressure of blood was performed by Stephen Hales on December 1, 1733. He took a live horse. Attached a tube to her left crural artery, then allowed her blood to rush through the tube and it rose to a height of 8’3”. He noted that “when it was at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each pulse 2, 3,or 4 inches”. Yes the horse bled out, but don’t think Mr. Hales was too cruel, he performed the experiment on a horse that was about to be put down anyway! To the horse, I’m sure this distinction didn’t matter much of course. 🙂<br/>*Legal Disclaimer: While I am a medical professional, this article contains general information about medical conditions and treatments.

Whenever I eat crisps (chips if you live in the USA) which have a fairly large amount of salt, my BP goes up significantly the next few days.<br/>I tried getting saltless crisps about a week ago and added my own “lo-salt” (a salt substitute consisting of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (salt), but twice as much as the former than the latter).<br/>Anyway the lo-salt flavoured crisps (chips) diodn’t raise my BP at all.<br/>OK I know that further experiments on myself is required. But at the moment I’m strongly suspecting salt as the culprit. I’m also suspect that sugar increases my BP too. But lots of investigation required to establish that!<br/>Maybe you have a poor potassium to sodium balance. My mum has hypertension and was on a low sodium diet but she was not getting enough potassium and her blood pressure was not stable. If you are concerned you may want to have your blood potassium level checked.<br/>Now that she is consuming enough potassium she her blood pressure has been normal for over a year while consuming sodium within normal ranges(more than 2500 mg)<br/>It’s not the sodium…. it’s the fat and starch that is making you fatter and fatter; and that, is you body mass increasing and making it harder for your heart to pump blood through the veins and arteries that get squished in your body by the increased amount of accumulated fat.<br/>you are eating pure bloody starch and pointing to salt instead of the sugar, anything to avoid incrimination of sugar not too mention vegetable oil that increases all causes of death. You get far more osmolality from the sugar<br/>Hard evidence needed? Not a myth and very easy to document — requires little intelligence or training, anyone can do it. At the age of 52-54, this was over a two year period (2005 and 2006). Used a software program (Diet Power 4 — I paid $50 for it but it is now free to download) to track food, sodium, and bicycle exercise time. Produced graphs using the pen and paper method although will do the same thing being the program had no provisions to enter data on blood pressure. A doctor taking a reading every three to six months is absolutely is of no value in my opinion if an effort is not made to take the reading under identical circumstances other than to show a general trend over several years.<br/>I found that to be of any value, for my graph type and hypothesis (now proven), it was necessary to take several readings over a period of at least five minutes or until two close (three or less numerical spread and no more than three bpm on heart rate) readings. I would take note of readings after a two mile walk or an hour of biking at a slow to moderate rate. Wide swings over five minutes quit after I got in physical shape and stayed on the diet. Professional sites recommend sitting down 3 minutes or more and taking more than one reading but I only had one or two doctors in the last twenty years doing that, some over the need to quickly see another patient. A nurse claimed the significant reason for taking blood pressure readings were the insurance companies insisting on it. She claimed some doctors did not look at the readings she took so who cares if an effort was made to get an accurate reading was her conclusion.<br/>Walk in after rushing to show up on time, climbing stairs or whatever, sit down, a nurse grabs your arm and takes your blood pressure. At one time I convinced a doctor to take a second reading after ten minutes of discussing with me my medical problems. He claimed he had seldom waited, a man with 15 years of experience although professional sites recommended waiting three minutes. Another doctor claimed he had never heard of Na effecting blood pressure (he had been an army doctor with different standards for education he claimed).<br/>Now to the results. The graphs were beautiful and showed a perfect coalition between the the five factors entered; food type, sodium amounts, exercise, heart rate, weight.<br/>I had been on blood pressure medicine for ten years with only a numerical change of 5. I also was in sedentary employment and received zero exercise. My weight was at the upper end of normal weight or slightly overweight. I would would eat typical amounts of sodium for Americans (2,000+ mg) over two days. Then various amounts of low sodium for 4 days then gradually increase over a period of several days. After 72+ hours of a low sodium diet and exercise program, my blood pressure would drop significantly. 135/90 to 110/70 over three days was typical after being on my diet plan (the DASH diet) for one month. Sugar levels and high chemical foods were also recorded as part of diet. Sodium intake showed up more than others exercise as the biggest variable. High chemical foods also showed a difference although high chemical foods often have high sodium levels.<br/>Over four day after resuming the DASH diet there would be a significant and gradual change to the upside. It takes two or more days, depending on physical activity and water consumption to dissipate the sodium in your blood is my hypothesis although I have never confirmed this from research.<br/>I suspect sodium levels for proper blood pressure varies between people and different body designs (gender, race, activity, fat vs skinny, exercise level, etc). Many people may have little if any effect from a 2,000 mg vs 600 mg of Na. I’m not one of those. It is estimated cavemen had a diet of 400 to 600mg Na. What was good enough for cavemen (who had short lives for other reasons) was good enough for me.<br/>I had to make an effort to stay at 600 mg because of my diet. The diet I was on was 200 to 400 mg if I did not force myself to use that salt shaker). Sodium is a necessary part of your diet. I found Na amounts over 1000 mg were too much for my body. I have hypertension and heart palpitations with shortness of breath. My thyroid lab readings became perfect and the doctor took me off thyroid medication and blood pressure medication. My heart palliation’s and shortness of breath at 3 to 5 a.m. every night quit after one month. All my problems resumed significantly when I got off my diet plan/exercise in recent years. Of interest one older doctor who had been in the profession for forty years claimed I was only one of two people that went from a TSH level of 0.0 to 4.0 (the upper range of normal) after quitting the medication. Thyroid problems have resumed along with blood pressure, heart and heart palliation’s. I have now resumed the diet and exercise plan and tracking. I’ll send in an update after three months.<br/>I’m only one person, so put 400 people on the same program I’ve been on and see what happens. Problem of course is finding 200 honest people out of that 400 that do not fib on the diet and exercise database or guess. It also takes will power to stick to a program. I stuck with it for ten years then quit for miscellaneous reasons. Remove the ones from the database that show no improvement who refuse to swear under oath and take a lie detector test!<br/>Salt (Sodium) DOES raise your blood pressure. I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 130/90. She told me to control my salt (sodium 1500mg limit) and I had a check up two days later with my blood pressure 108/87. Anytime I eat lots of salty foods, I get a spike in my pressure. I am definitely salt sensitive.<br/>SALT (SODIUM) DOES affect your blood pressure. You have to be careful (it sneaks up on you good) and adjust your diet to limit sodium intake and watch for signs of your pressure raising. Especially when your body behavior changes.<br/>Work out as well! If you are lazy or not that active, take 30 minute walks 5 days a week (150 minutes total) minimum to get a decent exercise.<br/>I think the point is that recommending a lower sodium diet, that maybe affects a specific set of people, those who already have hypertension and are salt sensitive, to an entire population is ridiculous. Another point is whether high salt intake leads to chronic cardiovascular problems, which is being touted as fact to the public but has no research to back it up. I consume way more sodium than the CDC recommends and my BP has never been higher than 117/70, my highest ever, normal about 100-110/65-70. Neither of our cases prove one way or the other the effects “high” sodium intake has on the general population.<br/>You may have low cellular potassium, high copper, low vitamin k2, low magnesium, low vitamin E, heavy metal toxicity such as lead, everyone is exposed to lead and fluoride, these things compound each other.<br/>Look at conditions that cause you to have this salt sensitivity such as low potassium high cortisol.<br/>Don’t just rest on salt because you likely will have multiple issues as well almost no-one just eats salt by itself.<br/>Salt is generally found in high simple sugar no fiber foods with additives.<br/>Understand guidelines are for the whole population not just for you, this is problematic because unrefined salt is not shown to be unhealthy for most people and to some it improves health and in making these guidelines with no recognition of biochemical individuality.<br/>Understand lowering HBP is not the be all and end all, this has been mechanically done by drugs in studies which show no improvement in outcomes and even worsening of symptoms outside of the sign of BP measurement.<br/>Things to consider, Olive leaf extract, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin k2, potassium, curcumin, stevia(the natural sweetener), magnesium, pomegranite, l-arginine, nattokinase, fish oil, cocoa, beetroot, alpha lipoic acid, bromelain, flax seed, celery, coq10, flax seed, hawthorne. All these improve BP and cardiovascular issues. You have a lot more in your toolkit than you think<br/>As for Sugar, women should limit their sugar (Total Carbs is what matters and watch out for certain sugar alcohols) 20g-30g a snack and 30g-45g each meal. Men should keep their snack the same as women 20g-30g a snack and 60g – 75g a meal. The lowest numbers are the lmit for diabetics of course.<br/>I believe that some people have a sensitivity to sodium. I’m convinced that I do. After being on 3 different BP meds at one time and still having uncontrolled hypertension, I started reading food labels and drastically reducing my sodium intake. Most processed foods are loaded with sodium. I have been able to stop 2 meds completely and reduce the third one to 1/4 the prescribed dosage. For me, reducing sodium has made a huge difference. Last night I took 10 mg of lisinopril, which is 1/4 of the prescribed daily dosage. Today my BP is too low, 105/48. I really have to consistently monitor it, as low BP isn’t much fun, either.<br/>Blood pressure drugs are ineffective, they fail to improve outcomes only the BP reading.<br/>You have reduced your intake of low potassium high salt high sugar low fiber junk foods, this was always going to lower your blood pressure.<br/>Salt is not the enemy you just require potassium and antioxidants to balance it out and lower stress.<br/>When people reduce sodium in this way you cant contribute it to salt itself, you have completely altered your dietary intake of many things, this is how people can be fooled into thinking its a single thing.<br/>This attribution of a singular cause to problems is constantly done in hypothesis and they tend to be completely bogus demonizing singular things like Co2, salt, saturated fat, cholesterol, lack of seratonin, even lack of the poison fluorides use.<br/>These are all myths that fail under scrutiny but continue to be upheld as causes by regulating bodies by cherry picking and dismissal of minimization of overwhelming contradictions. The pharmaceutical junk food and vegetable oil corporations benefit and misinform the public for profit to which the FDA racketeers for them killing off their competition.<br/>Medicine research and much of other research is a cesspool of incestuous deception between private interest and boosting the economy as well as politicians doctors and government profit.<br/>The editors of the journals studies are published in find most studies to be entirely lacking, conclusions to be spun towards confirmation bias and that we are in quite a dark age for science where belief, consensus and peer review are less about good science and more about blackballing competing belief and evidence that will damage profits and future grants.<br/>Yea, whatever. Believe what you want. I have been reading health books for years….DECADES…and I’ve have read in them EXACTLY what is printed in this article. There NEVER has been a proven link between salt and high blood pressure. Furthermore, in one of books it pointed out that salt is used to make stomach acid, and it’s ironic that as we age, the low sodium diet so often touted leads to digestive problems.<br/>Keep believing doctors who take 3 credits of Nutrition in college and pitch compounds that cause worse side effects than the actual disease.<br/>Doctors, who say Chiropractic is “not real medicine.” Read the Winsdor papers. A doctor who set out to prove Chiro was fake by doing autopsies found that 99 out of 100 organ failures were due to lack of nerve energy caused by “subluxations” which pinch the nerves and interrupt nerve energy flow. (I’m not a chiropractor).<br/>Go read books by Norman Walker, (especially “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.”), TC Fry, and Herbert M. Shelton (Superior Nutrition, Fasting can save your life). I’ve read them all.<br/>BOTTOM LINE this is an excellent article and I’m actually surprised to see the truth so openly posted in an article like this…but you believe what you want & take chemicals pushed by the medical profession…eat what you want, drink what you want, don’t exercise and when things go wrong just take a pill….<br/>I attempted to look up these “Winsdor Papers” and even Google doesn’t know what you are talking about. If you really want to win people over, you should actually post links to the information you want us to read.<br/>Guys you all are missing one point: sodium is poisonous to us. Even if does not raise BP, its still poison ;/ not good at all<br/>@Marco: You would die instantly without sodium in your body.<br/>I am not the same Marco as Mr. “Salt is poison”. Just to be clear<br/>Of course – everything in excess is bad – heck, even drinking too much water will kill you.<br/>Now, every person is different so you have to find what works for you. Mine, I like salted 🙂<br/>This article is misleading. Just because salt’s negative effect on blood pressure is a “theory” doesn’t mean we should ignore it. In fact most of medicine and science is carried out on plausible theories. The truth is a low salt diet is less harmful than a high salt diet and like all things the real moral of the story is moderation. Also this author contradicts themselves by saying there is “no evidence… Yes none” to support this theory, but then goes on to cite at least one study that shows the negative corrolatuon in humans and another involving rats. That’s evidence, at least some not none. Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that. Sure sometimes we are far from knowing but in this case there’s enough science behind salts impact on BP to make it worth considering. Also remember the human consumption of high salt quantities is a fairly new thing on the evolutionary scale, so it’s impact on our bodies is fairly unnatural.<br/>@Mike: “No evidence… Yes none” I think Scott is meaning “No reputable evidence” Or, rather, “No evidence that is not flawed.”<br/>“Everything in moderation” Yep, exactly. As Scott is fond of saying, “Even water will kill you in high enough doses.” He even once told me a story of a woman he attempted to treat for this very thing- she drank massive amounts of water and ended up dying from it.<br/>“Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that.” I don’t think any doctors would ever say that. Maybe a century or two ago. But there is an amazing amount of good science involved here these days. We are far from knowing everything, but it’s certainly not black magic or just guess work, as that would seem to imply.<br/>Sorry to disagree with you Dave. But even on the sources of the video, the rise of blood pressure on high-salt diets is evident. While in the end of one of them, while talking about softdrinks and snacks companies:<br/>“Some of these companies have been preeminent in trying to create an artificial controversy doubting the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure,16,17 presumably in the hope of stopping or slowing down any reduction in population salt intake to protect soft drink sales.”<br/>Even, I’m not a specialist in the area, the lacks of a literature review in source about this matter is disturbing.<br/>oh diets that are processed foods with low fat high sugar high additive, observational studies are meaningless, these people are eating copious amounts of sugar each year. If you think corporations are trying to be allowed to use more salt its ridiculous distraction in doing anything to not look at the sugar metabolism syndrome epidemic.<br/>How moronic that you think observational studies matter for anything other than proposing a hypothesis, you then use intervention and double-blind placebo studies with no variables to prove them causal. THIS IS NOT DONE, this is also not done for cholesterol or saturated fat. You are a gullible victim of pathological science, when he says there is no evidence there is no evidence observational studies do no control for anything they are not an experiment, this is not how science works. You do understand cochrane are perhaps the most neutral group for clinical study in the world and they reviewed 150 trials and 13 population studies. Here you are saying their findings are wrong based on what? nothing other than your belief based on a hypothesis with no evidence.<br/>I suggest you read the book “Salt”. It is mostly a geopolitical historical account of salt in our civilization, but it also has a good deal of science in it. We built our civilization on salt.<br/>The first paragraph says ” just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence,” I believe that since this is a scientific minded website it shouldn’t use the word theory in this context, since in science, a theory is an accepted explanation of a phenomenon, proven by testing.<br/>Yeah, he should have used hypothesis. I’m going to have to look up the history of theory and see if anyone knows how it ended up with two such different meanings.<br/>For a medical professional (which leads to an assumption of advanced education), you have a horrible grasp of grammar and spelling. This discredits much of what you say, in my mind. Having someone else review your work before publishing would go a long way.<br/>I will continue to listen to my cardiologist on this matter and limit my salt intake.<br/>@Mark: Something you’ll find seemingly true about a large number of medical professionals, the stereotype of their handwriting being horrible is generally correct. (Scott’s is particularly bad.) And their technical writing can also sometimes be particularly terrible, pre-edit. (They study medicine and the human body, not writing, after all) But, in over 100+ articles Scott has written, he has never been shown to be wrong on a main point (and only a few cases of being wrong on a minor point). Typos? Awkward sentence? You will always find at least one of these in each of his articles, despite my sincerest efforts to get rid of them all. But in the end, I care about accuracy much more than grammar. Both would be good, but finding a writer of Scott’s particular expertise and ability to think critical and process vast amounts of medical knowledge is extremely difficult. These people aren’t a dime a dozen. 🙂<br/>But really, the strength of Scott’s arguments are never based on his extensive medical knowledge. That just helps him thoroughly vet the various studies on the subject where most would get lost in the terminology, let alone be able to think critically about them and their methodology. The strength of the argument is the studies themselves. In this one, you’d do well to actually read the two Cochrane reviews, and perhaps forward them to your cardiologist for his/her thoughts.<br/>Don’t be surprised if he/she has already ready them though, and maybe even agrees with them. What doctors tell their patients doesn’t always line up with what they actually know or believe to be true. Particularly in cases like this where lawsuits may be a very real possibility if they told you to eat all the salt you wanted, then you died of a heart issue (but having nothing to do with the salt), then your family sues them and cites what various government agencies say on the subject, rather than what the medical world actually thinks. 🙂 Watching your sodium isn’t likely to hurt either, but covers the cardiologists’ backside. (I actually had an interesting discussion about this with Scott just last night about a doctor he was discussing this with who said something very similar as to why despite that he knows sodium isn’t going to be harmful in this way, he still tells certain of his patients to watch their sodium intake.)<br/>In the end, as I always say, “Question everything,” but also when questioning, do the research to find the answers too, and then double check that research just to make sure. 🙂 And, maybe don’t make the mistake of equating grammar and writing ability with knowledge of a subject or intelligence. I’ve worked with a ton of writers. I can say, journalists (and other such people with a writing background) are great at writing… They almost all are horrid at research, which surprised me on the journalists, but maybe explains a lot about the state of media reporting on scientific studies. Funny enough, the best combo of writing ability and research seems to be lawyers. They are phenomenal at both in my experience. Scientists, or people with a science background, tend to be poor at writing, but incredible at research and critical thinking. Of course, that’s only going with a sample-size of a few dozen writers I’ve worked with, and there is one exception I’ve found in that, but it’s a trend I’ve observed.<br/>I think everyone must be different. For me salt raises my blood pressure a lot. I check the bl pr 4-6x a day. Stays low enough when i stay under 300 mg of salt. As soon as i eat a lot of salt, like chinese food or even a meat and cheese sub or two slices of pizza my bl pr goes to 170/98. It takes a couple days to get the salt out of my body. Then it will go down to 130/80 and sometimes a bit lower. I am 67.<br/>you just offered up things containing large amounts of simple carbohydrates, also containing wheat. Sugar has high osmolality but is ignored due to the weight applied to salt<br/>Dietary wheat elimination alone can lower bp by 20-40 mmHG. The company life extension says this also beneficially optimizes blood lipid profiles.<br/>Do you see how you are perhaps basing what you see on assumption based on what you have been told based on the hypothesis that has no evidence.<br/>cardiovascular issues in observational studies only found a correlation with people eating the very large amount of 5 grams of salt a day, you can imagine what amount of junk foods they are eating to attain this amount.<br/>If your problem is salt you have an underlying condition causing it because you are not getting a high amount in any way, however you are also ignoring other causes which is the problem when singular things are touted as the main contributing factor when no evidence suggests they are the cause.<br/>consider your cellular potassium, copper, lead exposure, magnesium, vitamin E intake, coq10 levels, irritants and stress that can increase coagulation and vessel constriction.<br/>If I may comment on the whole spelling/grammar controversy… in my experience from observing people, the populace (at least the intelligent ones, my whole family is high IQ and my husband is a genius, literally, and as I have no lower-intelligence friends for a control group, I can only speak from my observations of my family and husband’s family,) is divided into two types: math-people and word-people. My father was a math person, as was I when I was very small, however, I lived with my mother, who is most definitely a words person, my whole life, leading to my developing into a words person. My husband may very well be the smartest person I’ve ever met, but from his spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, you’d never know it. He’s a computer repair tech, can fix anything, highly versatile in his job abilities, can solve algebra problems that I’m struggling with for minutes at a time with just a glance, but can’t spell our son’s name.<br/>As far as I can tell, scientists tend to be math people more than word people. (Just for the record, one of my previous jobs was research, and I’m a grammar Nazi and sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>I was wondering if I could ask the author of this article for a small favor.<br/>At the beginning I read this sentence in regard to salt intake:<br/>“But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize [it is just a theory] and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence…”<br/>Here you are using “Theory” in its popular parlance. WHich is fine and all. The problem is that this is a scientific related article and when a theory is not supported by evidence we call it a “Hypothesis”.<br/>Those of us that write in the scientific realm should make an effort to make this distinction, mostly because the next time I get some Young Earth Creationist telling me evolution is “just a theory” I swear I am going to start jumping up and down like a Chimpanzee and make backward sammerault. Then I’ll throw feces at him/her.<br/>I am sure you don’t want such a scene to become reality. Heck, you probably don’t want to think it up in your mind.<br/>So let’s start a campaign to call a Theory a “a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena” and call anything that is meant to be pulled from one’s rear orifice an “Hypothesis”.<br/>BTW: I know the dictionary return both meanings. FOr the sake of Science, let’s change the meaning back since we already have a good working word for “I just pulled this out of my ass”.<br/>@Marco: That’s a good point. I’ll start working that distinction in to future articles. 🙂<br/>Not a single legitimate conclusion can be drawn from a single blood pressure measurement. BP varies widely even from moment to moment. I have many times seen 160/100 drop to 130/75 over the course of a few minutes. As well, BP measuring equipment is highly variable and susceptible to wide variations from things like cuff size and user variations.<br/>Any conclusions drawn from a few measurements are nothing more than speculation and wishful thinking.<br/>First, this is not a peer-reviewed journal article. I agree, the correct use of “theory” has been obfuscated by the colloquial “just a hunch” version. But, let’s move on, ok?<br/>I don’t get that the article is in the least bit misleading. I do get that the author makes the point that apparently is lost on many — “As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.”<br/>He also mentions to think critically. So, if you don’t believe him, a) continue with your belief, or b) find out for yourself. Do the legwork. Read the articles. Now you have a starting point. Thank him for that.<br/>In my opinion, focusing on the occasional grammatical error or “theory vs. hunch” debate unnecessarily diminishes the author’s intent. My takeaway is that this article helps challenge my assumptions about what I thought was already scientifically concluded. I learned something. That’s the point.<br/>@Michael Stelly I am not sure if you were referring specifically to my post in regard to the usage of “theory”, but I assure you that my comment was not intended to criticize the writer at all. At least not in the same terms as a grammatical or spelling “error”.<br/>My comment is not about an “error” rather it is a suggestion that those of us that read and write about science do our part to reclaim the usage of the word “theory” from the mainstream or that at least we try.<br/>There are those that comment on obvious spelling errors and I agree they are not important in the context of the information provided in the article (although I agree they can be distracting and I am speaking from a non native English speaker), but unless their number and character is such that they make understanding the article difficult or even impossible, you won’t find me posting about them.<br/>The word “theory” on the other hand is a word that is being actively used by certain factions of the science / religion discussion to discount 200 years of scientific advancement and it is being actively used to mislead children into discounting science as a whole.<br/>If you have watched the Nye – Ham debate, Gawker asked some creationists to write a question to evolution supporters on a piece of paper and they published these questions in the form of pictures. Invariably the “it’s just a theory” question appeared.<br/>It’s in that spirit that I have asked the curators of this website to try to use the word in its scientific meaning. If we in the science and technical fields don’t do that, we cannot expect those that want to distort science for their objectives to do it on their own.<br/>So, with all due respect, I won’t take your advice. I will certainly let slide silly spelling errors but this is important to me and it should be important to all of us that love science.<br/>no one distorts science more than evolutionists, inference and speculation based on an assumption of fact are not evidence. No field has as many hoaxes and assumptions as evolution.<br/>Continuing to use the flawed contrasting argument and assumption that because creation must be wrong evolution must be true is not science, the evidence does not show macroevolution to be possible at this point under any of the many current competing theories based solely on mutation and natural selection. I would suggest another mechanism must be found.<br/>As it stands contradictory evidence is completely ignored or even claimed as evidence of a more complex process but still a proof of evolution when it is no such thing in all cases.<br/>We currently have evidence for abiogenesis that it is an absolute fact as is microevolution absolutely correct, however, in terms of macroevoltuion I would suggest science returned to being based on evidence not an assumption of fact and skewing of data to induce it too fit the theory.<br/>As it stands evolution is not science it is a belief much like the big bang theory which has massive conflicting evidence that in the past when people used evidence to prove or disprove theories this theory would have been shelved, the combination of both these theories is akin to a religion, the religion of secular humanists. It is as political as they come the communities that uphold these beliefs black ball and ad hominem they cannot stand on the evidence but on intimidation. Studies show ad hominem is as useful as reasoned argument, this is used by illigitamate science suche as Co2 based climate alarmism and macroevolution which currently do not have evidence in their favor yet use the same types of propaganda and attacks suggesting anyone opposing them is anti-science or a moron.<br/>I suggest reading http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>People who do not agree with evolution don’t automatically believe creation, the evolutionist always attacks and distracts from their own weak argument creates their own strawman of what others believe and assume based on their own often moronic assumptions that they are backed by evidence when they are not.<br/>One fact I would like to add:<br/>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are another piece of evidence in this controversy. Interestingly, thiazides are called diuretics but when taken daily this diuretic effect becomes almost zero. After a period of chronic thiazide therapy, the primary benefit these medications provide is that they increase the elimination of sodium and chloride ions from the blood by way of the Na/Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule (along with other effects such as retention of calcium). Despite losing the diuretic effect thiazides retain their blood pressure lowering effects long-term and are one of the medications used first line for lowering blood pressure. This lowering effect is generally attributed to the elimination of sodium and seems to be in line with the idea that high sodium levels do increase blood pressure.<br/>Believe it or not. Salt appears to lower my BP. If I eat too many chips I actually get dizzy from low BP. Can’t say I get it.<br/>This “theory” is simply stupid. Salt DOES increase blood pressure big time! It’s a fact, observed, monitored. Accidentally eat some pretty salty stuff one day than needed a week of diuretics to get rid of all that salt from the body and bring the blood pressure from 190-200 (!!yes, that high it got!!!) back to normal (120-130). So don’t tell stories which aren’t true.<br/>Not all people respond the same to dietary salt. My suggestion for us is to take note of the sodium level in our normal lab results in minimal annual physicals.<br/>From childhood, I am used to take more salt with my meals, but never faced the problem of High BP, instead sometimes it goes below normal. I Googled this problem & came to the conclusion that my body needs salt more than normal to compensate for genetically transmitted ‘Low BP’ problem. So? Your Brain is the instructor for your health. You must follow its orders to stay Really Healthy!<br/>Well, I’m just a nutritionist (like a University Nutrition major that will be graduating in May) and maybe what I learnt is bull, but after being thought about the pathophysiology of how sodium can impact blood pressure, I find that the recommendation makes sense, but you would need to do more than just cut sodium. One thing that’s important is the sodium: potassium ratio (ie you eat a bunch of high processed, sodium added foods compared to fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables). I’ll admit that not everyone is salt sensitive and that we have consciously decided, in the health field, to assume that everyone is because testing for salt-sensitiveness (if that’s a word!) is expensive, long, and impractical. But the idea that there is no good plausible evidence linking salt and hypertension is false. Here’s just 6 articles. These aren’t the ones that were given by our professors to read (though if you want me to find them for you I’m sure I can), but they’re good one’s nonetheless and you don’t need a special University code or membership to access them. Anyways, here you go in case you want to read more:<br/>Do any of those show that there’s a correlation without other factors? You say “you would need to do more than just cut sodium”… is there evidence that doing those other actions without cutting sodium doesn’t work as well as cutting sodium too?<br/>Did you not read? Cochrane used 150 trials and 13 studies right? so you have 6, this is your “education” at work. Brainwashing and then confirmation biased search for support of the faulty hypothesis that has been found to be not of high quality already.<br/>If Cochrane did not use it it is not a high quality article, if it did then the support was not significant in the article. The osmolality mechanism applies to high sugar diets yet its all about salt<br/>The problem here is low quality studies are published constantly that people infer causation from where they can’t possibly do so as they did not control all the variables.<br/>The same thing is done for the lipid hypothesis and the cholesterol hypothesis.<br/>These are also myths, cholesterol from all data is inversely related to heart disease slightly.<br/>Statins absolute risk reduction for heart disease is 1.4% this is hardly significant, statins effects for decreasing heart problems in those already having a heart attack may be entirely due to their effect as an anticoagulant. Once again pathological junk science is being used to push treatments without recognizing mechanisms and variables. Most people will be harmed by inhibiting vitamin k coq10 and cholesterol synthesis via statins yet doctors backed by pharmaceutical greed promote giving them to everyone.<br/>Saturated fat has no mechanism via which it can raise cholesterol, no study of oil replacement purely substituted fat for oil in double blinds controls all variables and the closer they come to doing so the worse the outcomes for PUFA intervention becomes increasing all causes of death.<br/>Like is said the trials are low quality there is not much will to overturn hypothesis that regulating bodies and doctors have a religious belief in that is not backed by evidence. This misinformation leads to poor health and pharmaceutical profit.<br/>I have been torn between to eat more salt or not, because eating more salt reduces my heart rate and BP and makes me sleep better; my hands and feet feel full and warm. My sweat volume increase as I bike or walk. But then after taking it for a week or 2 then I notice that BP becomes persistently high; which makes me feel I did wrong by eating. What this article mentions is fluid volume increase which is interesting. Before increasing my salt intake my fingers feel thin. Maybe after fluid levels feel normal cut back on salt to normal levels. So I am just hypothesizing that people who have are salt sensitive have good fluid volume and should watch salt intake, others can take salt but stop when it feels full. Basically use salt maintain fluid volume.<br/>Based on self-experimentation, I think maintaining fluid volume is very important. At times, I find that I feel thirsty and drink water and that it keeps coming out; that calls for some salt intake. Basically, I do not eat canned food or much fast foods, my salt intake is what is purposely added in cooking. After exercise, (eating by the book and working out etc cause problems too) I notice that when I stand up from sitting position, I feel dizzy but not normally. I think I may be sweating out salt and , of course, I drink a lot of water during the exercise. I am not proposing eating more salt. What I am stating is the way the body is telling you that your salt is depleted is when you are not feeling full in your feet and hands. I think this is correct to some extent, as the body works more on concentration of things than the absolute amounts. It is not a comprehensive theory as there are other things that may increase blood volume, you may be already having too much salt in blood etc. For the record, my sodium in the blood is always near the low end of the range so my err wont push me outside of the range.<br/>Ok what is the conclusion? do I use the salt shaker now or not? I have been holding too long.<br/>I think this article is irresponsible in that salt absolutely does raise bp in those who have a salt sensitivity. If I eat something very salty I can literally go into hypertensive crisis in a matter of an hour.<br/>This type of sensitivity is common and to not mention it (because it does not fit with the authors theory?) is dangerous.<br/>@Jim porter: “because it does not fit with the authors theory?” The “author’s theory” doesn’t exist. That’s really not what we do here. This is an article simply writing about scientific studies on the topic and saying what they say, so you don’t have to sift through them and all the medical jargon; we do it for you- essentially what we write about reflects the current state of human knowledge on the subject at hand. If it changes at some point, we update the article. In this case, however, most notably the two Cochrane reviews are pretty convincing: “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.” There are exceptions to every rule, and seemingly you are one and that’s very interesting if so and it would be interesting to learn the root cause. But, again, we look at what the scientific studies say and try to reflect that in what we write. Essentially we write a form of “light-reading” style entertaining survey papers on subjects, rather than write research papers.<br/>Stressing about salt will likely kill you long before salt itself will. Do what makes you happy and you will likely live longer than otherwise; and even if you don’t, at least you’ll enjoy the time you have.<br/>I believe the problem is when salt is mixed with fat and THAT causes high blood pressure. For example, someone talked about theirs rising when eating crisps/chips-that’s because the chips contain fat. The same would apply say to french fries or other fatty dishes. However, if you were to sprinkle salt on something like fruit, it wouldn’t have the same effect and not raise your blood pressure.<br/>I do think sodium gets a bad rap and some people actually do consume too little. I think having salt with fruit or salads is o.k. but the problem is the salt/fat combination and if you think about it, that’s where people usually get their salt-in potato chips, french fries, heavily seasoning meats, in creamy dishes, etc.<br/>The person who wrote this article adds nothing of value to the discussion about high blood pressure except to encourage people to stick their heads in the sand.<br/>I have been wrestling with high blood pressure for about 12 years since a serious accident caused me to be physically inactive for about a year after the accident.<br/>High blood pressure can be controlled with and without medications and individuals respond differently to different treatments and there are natural cures for this affliction.<br/>High blood pressure can cause strokes, brain hemmorhages and contribute to diabetes and kidney disease.<br/>The balance between potassium and sodium in our blood is very critical and unfortunately most doctors don’t have a clue about the effect that nutrition and proper hydration has on this condition.<br/>Most of the doctors I have been to just give out prescriptions which may or may not work.<br/>There are natural substances which have enabled me to lower my blood pressure within a few days from extremely high to almost normal while doctors and pharmacists will say that medications (like Cozaar and Norvasc)may take up to a month to work.<br/>I’ve found that the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water<br/>had significant effects.<br/>Drinking this once or twice per day has had a very significant effect in my case; my blood pressure went from 220/95 to 130/90 within 3 days.<br/>Garlic (deodorized) also helps and fruit or vegetable juices with lowered salt content and high potassium content also help. (V-8 low salt or V-8 green).<br/>This is not wishful thinking; it has to do with chemistry; this doesn’t mean that everyone will respond the same to these treatments but I disagree very strongly when someone says that salt has no effect<br/>on blood pressure.<br/>This seems to me to be irresponsible and cavalier, unless of course you work for one of the salt manufacturers.<br/>Salt is necessary and most table salts have iodine in them, which is an essential nutrient for humans.<br/>Drinking sufficient amounts of pure water is also very important; something that my doctors never bothered to mention.<br/>This enables the body to rid itself of excess salt and helps the body cleanse itself.<br/>There are many natural substances and some foods (like pesto) which can help lower blood pressure and you can find many posts on the internet about them.<br/>Web Md and The Mayo Clinic both have posts on the subject and I trust them a hell of alot more than the author of this post.<br/>This appears to me to be an exercise in defending the indefensible.<br/>To what purpose?<br/>Who was Hippocrates anyway and what the hell did he know?<br/>I have extremely low blood pressure. If I stand up too fast, I’ll faint flat on my face. My doctor told me to eat as much salt as I want, no worries.<br/>In any case, I’ll take all of this advice with a pinch of… you know what. ;-D<br/>I eat a lot of salt (and I do mean a *LOT*). A few years ago after getting fed up with constantly being told how bad this is, I decided to put it to the test. As a Ph.D. I know how to scientifically plan a test, and over several months minimizing as many variables as possible, I tested my blood pressure while at my regular salt intake versus low salt intake. The results were pretty much as expected, although some people /may/ be slightly intolerant to relatively high levels of salt intake, for me there was no difference at all. I have returned to eating food the way I like it (salty), and tell anybody who advises against this they simply don’t know what they are talking about LOL<br/>I’m 27 female. I started having high blood pressure while I was taking Accutane a year and a half ago (Accutane increases cholesterol buildup). What I experienced was intense, my pulse was at 120bpm, I was dizzy, my hands clamped up into an unusual claw shape and they tingled until they lost feeling. I thought I was actually dying. I was told it was just a panic attack, but I’ve never had any real anxiety issues. I was given oxygen for an entire hour when suddenly I started craving salt. I asked my friend to run to mcdonalds and get me some extra salty fries. Within minutes of eating all that salt, my blood pressure was back to normal, my hands got their feeling back, and I could walk and breath normally again.<br/>I find the things that trigger it the most for me are a lack of sleep, not eating anything all day, corn, wheat, and chemical salts such as MSG. But sea salt and normal table salt don’t make it worse, they make it better! With that said, I’ve always had blood test results showing high levels of potassium. Could this somehow be involved? My Dr. Just shrugs it off as caused by my love for potatoes and citrus fruits lol<br/>You might need a new doctor high potassium or hyperkalemia can cause the episodes you describe and Accutane can cause hyperkalemia.<br/>Potassium and sodium are obviously related as your cells constantly exchange these into and out of cells to maintain higher intracellular concentrations of potassium.<br/>Cortisol which raises with sleep deprivation, not eating and other stresses reverses this process of potassium concentration into the cell, but is meant to increase potassium excretion, cellular uptake of sodium absorption and sodium retention in the kidneys, there may be something going wrong with this process with potassium not being excreted. The normal reason is the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system which regulates blood pressure.<br/>Salt nourishes adrenals but you might want to get some more vitamin C which is concentrated there as well as in the pituitary gland as these regulate your cortisol and vit c lowers cortisol and stress likely lessening the severity of episodes.<br/>Things to look into, magnesium, vitamin e, adrenal glandular, copper/zinc levels, kidney and adrenal function.<br/>Pharmacist here. Thank you for all the helpful comments on this site. One can see all the intelligently written posts from people who have reduced their high blood pressure by limiting salt. I am one of these people. My blood pressure a year ago was running on average 180/120 when not medicated, and when on 3 different medications, on average 140/90. After feeling awful, either from adverse effects from the meds or from headaches from high blood pressure, I decided to alter my diet. The results I achieved were stunning. Blood pressure perfectly normal, 120/80. No headaches, or feeling like my throat was swollen, or feeling like my head was too hot….I could go on and on. I did this with NO expensive products. I just, as much as is possible nowadays in the U.S., ate non-processed foods, and avoided all added salt. Notice, all “added” salt. As many have correctly pointed out, salt is necessary to human life. And many foods naturally contain all the salt we need, so it is not necessary to add any. Listening to these supposed experts, I wonder how any humans ever survived 10,000 years ago if they weren’t lucky enough to find a salt block to lick every day! I read one comment about someone who has had good results from “the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water”. I would challenge him and others to just try the lemon juice with water. I find that if I clean myself out with just one glass of lemon-water once a week, it has had a splendid effect on my health. The other ingredients may help, but it would be an interesting experiment for you. So I, like, many, many others, am sensitive to salt. Maybe some people can eat a huge amount of salt on a regular basis with no adverse health effects. That is not true for many of us, and it is offensive when so called “professionals” or “scientists” dispute this. One thing I always tell my patients, “When it comes to your health, trust yourself above all others”. If you are convinced a particular medication is making you feel sick, and your doctor or pharmacist imply it’s all in your head, trust yourself, not them. If you, like me, feel a thousand times better when you limit your consumption of salt or processed foods, then please, keep doing what you are doing, and don’t listen to those who suggest otherwise! You will be healthier and happier. Thanks for listening, my friends from far away.<br/>While it’s certainly possible that you are salt sensitive, when you decided to alter your diet, you changed many other things in addition to how much salt you ate. Two of the easiest ways to lower blood pressure without altering salt are 1. lose weight. 2. eat more veggies and fruits (aka foods rich in potassium). Numerous clinical and observational studies have shown that the sodium-potassium ratio is likely more important than how much sodium you eat. [Note that this only applies to the 99.999999% of humanity who eats between 3k and 6k mgs of sodium a day. Salt probably is a problem if you’re eating way out of the normal range, like 12,000mg + of sodium a day.]<br/>I was going to basically say the same thing. I had high blood pressure… I did a 30 day Paleo Challenge… All clean from the earth foods. I actually increased my salt intake by introducing a lot of salty beef jerky and pickled food into my diet for snacking. Not only did my blood pressure end up near perfect… I also lost 16 pounds. I wasn’t even someone you would really consider over weight to begin with… 178 lbs to 162 lbs in 30 days. My weird headaches were gone… the whole nine yards that come with high blood pressure. I’m convinced the salt and blood pressure are not related… and I think its a cop out to people who really need to get on an actual healthy diet.<br/>This article is dangerous and might convince someone to use all the salt they want. But all I have to do is eat a couple of big bags of Potato chips and I am getting 180/90 within a couple of days, stay off the salt then for 3-4 days and hydrate well, back to 130/70. Now “maybe” I am hypersensitive, but since this has repeated a half dozen times, I avoid salt. There is plenty in normal foods/<br/>Looks like you dont know what you are talking about… read Curt Nicol DD PhD entry below. and read again this article… you’ve been biased by exposure to the doctors who got biased by years and years of all the yada..yada..yada… read the article again. Of course, you are not going to start eating salt by the pound… everything would taste awful anyway.<br/>What is dangerous is advice and treatments with no scientific basis based on hypothesis alone, the collateral effect of reducing most peoples regular salt intakes is eating less processed food containing huge amounts of refined or simple carbs, highly oxidation prone oils, denatured substances, contaminants and additives.<br/>Reducing these will lead to improved overall nutrition.<br/>Limiting salt on its own with no other variables will show little to no effect in most people and can be detrimental to others.<br/>Me to. I’ve entered a detail comment of stop and start tests that 100% proved my hypothesis that Na was one of the large contributors to blood pressure. Takes an effort to document and record methods and result. Mine was as high as 205/115. I got it down to a consistent 100/65 for two years. My work is documented in this comment section but has yet to show up.<br/>A lot of people here saying that eating a bag of chips increases their blood pressure. Do they not realize it isn’t a health food? Do they think it possibly doesn’t contain all the wrong stuff?<br/>There has to be some other high sodium food they can use to show how salt affects their blood pressure.<br/>That’s right… what is bad is the oil and grease that is going the the pipes and constraining them… plus potato chips, it’s all starch, which turns to sugar, then fat …<br/>I would not be credulous enough to think for a minute, that salt is NOT related to high blood pressure, and increased body temperatures, for it certainly DOES. I reduced my 160 over 80 blood pressure down to 119 over 81 in a few weeks by cutting my salt intake severely. Why is it everytime I eat a several servings of potato chips, or eat Mc Donald’s french fries, I get immediately face flushed and feverish? I have even felt and heard, yes, the constricted veins in my own head, after having high blood pressure, dilate, expand, and break open again,after drinking cups, and cups of water, with the disappearance of the fever, disappearance of discomfort or congested head feeling, and reduced blood pressure.<br/>This really bothers me, and I have t confess to being somewhat confused now. I LOVE salt and can consume more in a single meal than you are supposed to consume in a day. It never seemed to affect my b.p.<br/>Then when my b.p. started increasing as I got older, my doc said to cut out salt. So I did…with no real effect. I was actually admitted into hospital with a serious infection, only to find that when I was discharged, I had been kept on a low sodium diet, even though on admission, my sodium level was dangerously low.<br/>This all made me believe that the dangers of sodium were only a myth, at least for me anyway. But then my wife got ill. Her b.p. was being constantly monitored as it kept going too low. They used to inject her with “sodium” (salty water I believe) and her blood pressure would come up almost immediately. This was intravenously however.<br/>So is it that I’m not salt-sensitive, or is it something about the stomach that acts a s barrier (so ingested salt does not affect you), while IV salt will?<br/>For something that is so fundamental in medical advice, it is so frustrating that there seems to be so little research, at least quality research done on it.<br/>Conversely, on a later admission to hospital, they had me on low sodium again (once and idiot puts it on your medical records, it seems impossible to get it off…) and gave me a blood pressure reducing medication. My b.p. dropped through the floor and was worrying them at one stage.<br/>BP medications are not evidenced to improve outcomes or be safe in most situations. Modern medicine is quite dangerous they kill people constantly with what they prescribe.<br/>Your wife may have kidney and adrenal problems while you more likely have vascular problems. Consider the possible environmental causes, you drink water with fluoride that increases absorption of lead, lack of antioxidants like ala, vit a/e/c/d/k2 can lead to increased oxidative stress arterial sclerosis and calcification of arteries restricting the ability of vessals to dialate, increased irritant exposure raises vasoconstriction and coagulation by increased seratonin release and lower amounts of nitric oxide produced by endothelial damage, low vitamin c leads to lessened collagen synthesis as does raised cortisol levels, both lead to poor circulation.<br/>These things can cause problems anywhere.<br/>I just spent an hour writing up a comment. My doctor wishes to see it. I doe not show up. What is going on? Did I waste my time? Please respond.<br/>Excellent article. Articles of this type bring out the health nutters and know-it-alls….just take a look at the comments. This also reminds me of the “global warming”….”climate change” (or whatever they are calling it this week) “experts” who preach it like it was gospel when they too have no definitive proof. | Факт или мит: Натрият повишава кръвното налягане<br/>Е, Мат, оказва се, че диета с високо съдържание на натрий може да не повиши кръвното налягане, нито да има някакъв неблагоприятен ефект върху сърдечно-съдовото здраве изобщо. Но ще покрия теорията защо солта повишава кръвното налягане по-долу - просто осъзнайте, че това е просто теория и такава, която не е подкрепена от много от твърдите научни доказателства (и има повече доказателства, които казват, че не е така, отколкото го прави).<br/>Дебатът за яденето на твърде много сол съществува от 60-те години на миналия век. Почти всяка голяма правителствена здравна организация прегръща идеята, че яденето на твърде много сол е вредно за вашето здраве. Повечето големи медии съобщават за тези препоръки и хората са склонни да се опитват и да ги следват. Това е най-вероятно причината, поради която повечето от нас, особено възрастните хора със сърдечни проблеми, знаят как да намалят количеството сол, което ядем. Тези от нас, които харесват идеята, че всяка препоръка е подкрепена от солидни доказателства, трябва да се отдръпнат от тази. Както е посочено, в момента няма солидни доказателства, че солта хронично ще повиши кръвното ви налягане. Да, няма.<br/>И така, защо повечето здравни организации са прокарали идеята за диети с ниско съдържание на натрий? Теорията зад предположението им е здрава и има някои проучвания, които показват малък риск от повишено кръвно налягане с изключително висок прием на сол. За съжаление, има много други проучвания, които не показват увеличение, и все пак някои, които показват намаляване на приема на сол, всъщност могат да повишат кръвното ви налягане! Нека разгледаме спора по-подробно.<br/>Идеята, че солта ще повиши кръвното налягане, е свързана с осмотичното налягане. Осмозата е движението на разтворител (в този случай вода) през полупропускливи мембрани (като клетъчни стени), от области с по-ниска концентрация на разтворено вещество (в този случай сол) до области с по-висока концентрация на разтворено вещество. Това естествено изравнява концентрацията на разтворените вещества от двете страни на мембраната. (Това осмотично налягане е и причината солта да може да се използва за запазване на месото.)<br/>Така че теорията гласи, че когато ядем твърде много сол, в кръвта ни има повече натрий, отколкото в околните области на тялото ни. Увеличаването на водата в артериите и вените води до повишаване на налягането в тези артерии и вени. Самата сол също действа като дразнител в артериите, което ги кара да се свиват. Смята се, че това също повишава кръвното налягане.<br/>Теорията изглежда, на повърхността, много здрава. В края на краищата, можем да накараме процеса на извличане на солена вода през мембраните да се случва отново и отново в лабораторията. Въпросът е, дали това наистина се случва в телата ни и дали това всъщност причинява дългосрочна хипертония (високо кръвно налягане)?<br/>През 1969 г. Луис Дал свидетелства пред "избраната комисия по хранене и човешки нужди" на сенатор Джордж Макгавърн. Той е загрижен за високите концентрации на натрий в бебешките храни и смята, че това може да доведе до повишаване на кръвното налягане на хората в дългосрочен план. Неговите разсъждения са, че проучванията, направени върху плъхове, показват повишаване на кръвното налягане на плъховете.<br/>Разговорът за солта и хипертонията започва да циркулира сред здравните организации. Националните институти по здравеопазване, през 1972 г., започват да въвеждат "Образователни програми за високо кръвно налягане". Като тяхно доказателство, те посочват наблюдателно, популациите, които ядат много малко натрий, имат ниски инциденти на високо кръвно налягане. Учените по това време поставят под въпрос това, тъй като изследванията на плъховете ги карат да ядат 60 пъти повече от средния човек. Те също така посочват популациите, които ядат диети с ниско съдържание на натрий, също ядат ниски количества други неща, като захар (което също засяга осмозата).<br/>Въпреки възраженията им, публично, идеята за високо съдържание на натрий диети, причиняващи високо кръвно налягане е тук, за да остане, и остава и до днес. Центровете за контрол на заболяванията, Националните институти по здравеопазване, Американската сърдечна асоциация и много други организации в момента насърчават диетите с ниско съдържание на натрий.<br/>Въпреки привидно обединения фронт, представен от тези изтъкнати организации, полемиката сред учените е изключително разгорещена. През 1998 г. носителят на награди автор Таубес публикува "Политическата наука за солта" в Journal of Science. Той заявява, че "противоречието за ползите, ако има такива, от намаляването на солта сега представлява един от най-дълго продължаващите най-свирепи и сюрреалистични спорове в цялата медицина."<br/>Един главен хирург в доклад пише, че скоростта, с която федералните агенции на САЩ приемат намаляването на натрия, "отстоява в рязък контраст с това колко време е отнело на препоръките да се появят за значението на намаляването на нивата на холестерола в кръвта". Той също така отбелязва, че разликата е още по-забележителна, като се има предвид липсата на публикувани изследвания, които действително тестват теорията. От друга страна, сър Майкъл Роулингс, председател на Националния институт за здраве и клинични постижения, който насърчава диетите за намаляване на солта, твърди, че "Ръководството (в разработването на политики) се основава на най-добрите налични доказателства. Доказателствата обаче може да не са много добри и рядко са пълни." Не много силен аргумент за намаляване на приема на сол.<br/>Нека да разгледаме няколко сравнително скорошни проучвания. През 2008 г. италиански изследователи започват да публикуват резултатите от серия клинични изпитвания, всички от които съобщават, че сред пациентите със сърдечна недостатъчност, намаляването на консумацията на сол увеличава риска от смърт. Тези проучвания са последвани от други, които показват сред диабетици тип 1 и 2, здрави европейци и пациенти с хронична сърдечна недостатъчност, тези, които ядат сол в долната граница на нормалния диапазон, са по-склонни да имат сърдечни заболявания, отколкото тези, които ядат сол в средния диапазон на нормата.<br/>През 2011 г. два прегледа на Cochrane не откриха доказателства, че диетите с ниско съдържание на сол подобряват или влошават здравето на хората. "След повече от 150 случайни клинични проучвания и 13 проучвания на населението без и очевиден сигнал в полза на намаляването на натрий, друга позиция може да бъде да се приеме, че такъв сигнал може да не съществува."<br/>Дори и в лицето на няма ясни научни доказателства в подкрепа на това и някои напротив, през 2010 г. Центровете за контрол и превенция на заболяванията, Института по медицина и Американското дружество по хипертония всички продължиха да насърчават диети с ниско съдържание на натрий като средство за контрол на високото кръвно налягане.<br/>В крайна сметка, като медицински специалист и някой, който се нуждае от ясни доказателства, за да вземе решение дали да добавя обилно количество сол на пържените си картофи, се радвам да открия, че досега има много малко! Всички големи здравни организации изглежда насърчават диетите с ниско съдържание на натрий, но нито една не е публикувала последователни проучвания, които показват, че диетите с ниско съдържание на натрий помагат в здравето, особено не в сърдечно-съдовото здраве. Това, което намирам за най-досадно, един мой домашен любимец, е, че никоя от тези организации не казва на хората, че науката зад техните политики е спорна и те може да са напълно погрешни. Роналд Байер, Дейвид Мерит Джонс и Сандро Галеа го казаха най-добре в статията си "Сол и обществено здраве": "След внимателно разглеждане на дебата за солта, ние заключихме, че прикриването на научната несигурност е грешка, която не служи нито на целите на науката, нито на добрата политика."<br/>Значи сега трябва да излезеш и да задушиш всичко в сол? Както при повечето неща, ако науката не е успяла да отговори окончателно на въпроса по един или друг начин и искате да сте в безопасност, а не да съжалявате, просто продължете с вековното правило за "умереност във всичко". Ако вие, като мен, искате да осолявате всичко като ръба на чаша за маргарита и умереността да бъде проклета, поне сега можете да се почувствате малко по-добре за това, тъй като науката изглежда клони все повече и повече към това, че диетите с ниско съдържание на натрий са ненужни, а високите натриеви изобщо не са вредни.<br/>Ако сте харесали тази статия и Фактите за бонусите по-долу, може също да харесате:<br/>- Защо солта усилва вкуса<br/>- Какво означават числата в теста за кръвно налягане и какво казват на лекаря<br/>- Какво причинява ръцете, краката и краката, за да "падне заспал"<br/>Топ 5 трикове за първа помощ, които всеки трябва да знае<br/>- Как да премахнете пресни килим петно с нищо друго, освен сол<br/>- Високото кръвно налягане не е нито болест, нито заболяване само по себе си. Това е просто рисков фактор за други проблеми. Например, ако имате хронично високо кръвно налягане, рискът от сърдечен удар или инсулт се увеличава значително. Това високо налягане може да бъде причинено от прекомерна плака от вътрешната страна на стените на артериите, което прави тези артерии в сила, по-малки. Помислете за водопровод. Когато тръбите, които транспортират течност, стават по-малки, налягането, което същият обем течност упражнява, се увеличава. Какво ще стане, ако кръвното ви налягане стане твърде високо? Ще отговоря на този въпрос с друг. Какво ще стане, ако налягането на водата в тръбите на къщите ви стане твърде високо? Тръбите ви се спукат. Същото нещо тук. Ако кръвното ви налягане стане твърде високо, артериите ви имат по-голям шанс да се спукат. Ако има твърде много гангрена в тръбите ви (плака вътре в артериите), тази топка ганг може да стане твърде голяма и да запуши тръбите ви! Изглежда лошо и за мен! Особено, ако тези артерии са в мозъка или сърцето ти, не е като бъбреци, където имаш две, ако изтръгнеш теч в тези органи, и семейството ти най-накрая получи голямата заплата от застраховката ти живот! Не е най-добрият начин да ти платят, освен ако наистина не си кретен и всички в семейството ти те мразят!<br/>- Кръвното налягане се измерва в милиметри живак. За справка, 1 psi (паунда на квадратен инч) се равнява на 51,7149326 милиметра живак. Ако сте кървяли и сте искали да спрете загубата на кръв с директно налягане, а би трябвало, ще трябва да използвате само около 3 psi, за да го спрете. Освен ако нямат наистина високо кръвно налягане, тогава може би 4 psi. Базовата математика отново спасява деня!<br/>Първият известен експеримент за измерване на точното налягане на кръвта е извършен от Стивън Хейлс на 1 декември 1733 г. Прикрепва тръба към лявата си крузна артерия, след което позволява на кръвта й да се втурне през тръбата и тя се издига до височина 8'3". Той отбелязва, че "когато е на пълната си височина, тя ще се издига и пада при и след всеки импулс 2, 3, или 4 инча". Да, конят кървеше, но не мислете, че г-н Хейлс беше твърде жесток, той извърши експеримента на кон, който така или иначе щеше да бъде повален! За коня, сигурен съм, че това разграничение нямаше голямо значение, разбира се.<br/>*Правна отговорност: Докато съм медицински специалист, тази статия съдържа обща информация за медицински състояния и лечения.

Разширяване за препратки<br/>"Сподели Знанието!"<br/>Все повече се убеждавам, че солта значително увеличава кръвното ми налягане. Всеки път, когато ям чипс (чипове, ако живеете в САЩ), които имат доста голямо количество сол, кръвното ми се покачва значително през следващите няколко дни.<br/>Опитах се да получа безсолен чипс преди около седмица и добавих моя собствена "ло-сол" (заместител на солта, състоящ се от калиев хлорид и натриев хлорид (сол), но два пъти повече от предишния.<br/>Както и да е, чипсовете с вкус на ло-сол не вдигат кръвното ми изобщо.<br/>Добре, знам, че са необходими по-нататъшни експерименти върху мен, но в момента силно подозирам, че солта е виновникът, също така подозирам, че захарта увеличава и кръвното ми налягане, но са необходими много изследвания, за да се установи това!<br/>Майка ми има хипертония и беше на диета с ниско съдържание на натрий, но не получаваше достатъчно калий и кръвното й налягане не беше стабилно. Ако се притеснявате, може да искате да се изследва нивото на калия в кръвта Ви.<br/>Сега, когато тя консумира достатъчно калий, кръвното й налягане е нормално повече от година, докато консумира натрий в нормални граници (повече от 2500 mg)<br/>Не е от натрия... Това е мазнината и нишестето, което ви прави по-дебели и по-дебели; и това, е ли телесна маса се увеличава и го прави по-трудно за сърцето си, за да изпомпва кръв през вените и артериите, които получават squided в тялото си от увеличеното количество натрупани мазнини.<br/>Ядеш чисто кърваво нишесте и сочиш към сол вместо захар, всичко, за да избегнеш инкриминирането на захарта, не споменавай и растителното масло, което увеличава всички причини за смъртта.<br/>Необходими са твърди доказателства? Не е мит и много лесен за документиране – изисква малко интелигентност или обучение, всеки може да го направи. На възраст от 52-54 години това е било за период от две години (2005 и 2006). Използвах софтуерна програма (Diet Power 4 – Платих $50 за нея, но сега е безплатна за изтегляне) за проследяване на времето за упражнения за храна, натрий и велосипед. Произведени графики с помощта на писалка и хартия метод, въпреки че ще направи същото нещо е програмата не е имал разпоредби за въвеждане на данни за кръвното налягане. Един лекар, който чете на всеки три до шест месеца, е абсолютно безполезен по мое мнение, ако не се полагат усилия да се вземе четенето при идентични обстоятелства, освен да се покаже обща тенденция в продължение на няколко години.<br/>Открих, че за да има някаква стойност, за моя тип графика и хипотеза (сега доказана), е необходимо да се вземат няколко показания за период от най-малко пет минути или до две близки (три или по-малко числово разпространение и не повече от три удара в минута на сърдечната честота) показания. Бих взел под внимание показанията след двукилометрова разходка или час каране на колело с бавна до умерена скорост. Широките люлки над пет минути се отказват, след като вляза във физическа форма и остана на диетата. Професионалните сайтове препоръчват да седнете 3 минути или повече и да вземете повече от едно четене, но имах само един или двама лекари през последните двадесет години, които правят това, някои над необходимостта бързо да видят друг пациент. Медицинска сестра твърди, че значителната причина за отчитането на кръвното налягане са настояванията на застрахователните компании. Тя твърди, че някои лекари не са погледнали показанията, които е взела, така че кой го е грижа, ако е направено усилие да се получи точно четене, е заключението й.<br/>Влизам, след като бързам да се появя навреме, изкачвам се по стълби или каквото и да е, сядам, медицинска сестра хваща ръката ти и взема кръвното ти налягане. По едно време убедих лекар да вземе второ четене след десет минути обсъждане с мен на моите медицински проблеми. Той твърди, че рядко е чакал, човек с 15-годишен опит, въпреки че професионалните сайтове препоръчват да се чака три минути. Друг лекар твърди, че никога не е чувал Na да влияе на кръвното налягане (той е бил военен лекар с различни стандарти за образование, за което твърди).<br/>Сега към резултатите. Графиките бяха красиви и показаха перфектна коалиция между петте въведени фактора; вид храна, количества натрий, упражнения, сърдечен ритъм, тегло.<br/>Бях на лекарства за кръвно налягане в продължение на десет години само с числена промяна от 5. Аз също бях в заседнала работа и получих нула упражнения. Теглото ми беше в горния край на нормалното тегло или леко наднормено тегло. Бих ял типични количества натрий за американците (2 000+ mg) в продължение на два дни. След това различни количества ниско съдържание на натрий за 4 дни, след което постепенно се увеличават за период от няколко дни. След 72+ часа на диета с ниско съдържание на натрий и тренировъчна програма, кръвното ми налягане щеше да спадне значително. 135/90 до 110/70 в продължение на три дни беше типично, след като бях на диетата си (диета DASH) в продължение на един месец. Нивата на захарта и високите химически храни също са записани като част от диетата. Приемът на натрий се показва повече от други упражнения като най-голямата променлива. Високите химически храни също показват разлика, въпреки че високите химически храни често имат високи нива на натрий.<br/>Над четири дни след възобновяването на диетата DASH ще има значителна и постепенна промяна в посока нагоре. Отнема два или повече дни, в зависимост от физическата активност и консумацията на вода, за да се разсее натрия в кръвта ви е моята хипотеза, въпреки че никога не съм потвърждавал това от изследвания.<br/>Подозирам, че нивата на натрий за правилното кръвно налягане варират между хората и различните дизайни на тялото (пол, раса, активност, мазнини срещу кльощава, ниво на упражнения и т.н.). Много хора могат да имат малък ефект от 2000 mg срещу 600 mg Na. Аз не съм един от тези. Смята се, че пещерните хора са имали диета от 400 до 600 mg Na. Това, което беше достатъчно добро за пещерните хора (които имаха кратък живот по други причини), беше достатъчно добро за мен.<br/>Трябваше да положа усилия да остана на 600 mg заради диетата си. Диетата, на която бях, беше 200 до 400 mg, ако не се принудих да използвам тази солница. Натрият е необходима част от вашата диета. Открих, че Na количества над 1000 mg са твърде много за тялото ми. Имам хипертония и сърцебиене с недостиг на въздух. Лабораторните ми показатели на щитовидната жлеза станаха перфектни и лекарят ме спря от лекарства за щитовидната жлеза и лекарства за кръвно налягане. Сърдечната ми палиация и недостиг на въздух в 3 до 5 часа всяка нощ се отказват след един месец. Всичките ми проблеми се възобновиха значително, когато слязох от диетата си план / упражнение през последните години. От интерес един по-възрастен лекар, който е бил в професията в продължение на четиридесет години, твърди, че съм само един от двама души, които са преминали от ниво на TSH от 0,0 до 4.0 (горната граница на нормата) след спиране на лекарството. Проблеми с щитовидната жлеза са възобновени заедно с кръвното налягане, сърцето и палиацията на сърцето. Сега възобнових диетата и плана за упражнения и проследяване. Ще изпратя актуализация след три месеца.<br/>Аз съм само един човек, така че сложете 400 души на една и съща програма съм бил на и да видим какво ще се случи. Проблемът разбира се е намирането на 200 честни хора от тези 400, които не се fib на диета и упражнения база данни или предполагам. Също така се изисква воля, за да се придържате към програма. Аз останах с него в продължение на десет години, след което се отказах по различни причини. Премахване на тези от базата данни, които не показват подобрение, които отказват да се закълнат под клетва и да направят детектор на лъжата тест!<br/>Сол (натрий) НЕ повишава кръвното налягане. Отидох на лекар и кръвното ми налягане беше 130/90. Тя ми каза да контролирам солта си (граница на натрий 1500mg) и два дни по-късно си направих проверка с кръвното налягане 108/87. Всеки път, когато ям много солени храни, получавам пик в налягането. Определено съм чувствителен към солта.<br/>СОЛ (SODIUM) НЕ влияе на кръвното ви налягане. Трябва да бъдете внимателни (той се промъква добре) и да коригирате диетата си, за да ограничите приема на натрий и да следите за признаци на повишаване на налягането. Особено когато поведението на тялото ви се промени.<br/>Тренирайте също! Ако сте мързеливи или не толкова активни, вземете 30 минутни разходки 5 дни в седмицата (общо 150 минути), за да получите прилично упражнение.<br/>Мисля, че въпросът е, че препоръчването на по-ниска диета с натрий, която може би засяга определен набор от хора, тези, които вече имат хипертония и са чувствителни към сол, за цялото население е нелепо. Друг въпрос е дали високият прием на сол води до хронични сърдечно-съдови проблеми, които се изтъкват като факт за обществеността, но няма изследвания, които да го подкрепят. Аз консумирам много повече натрий, отколкото препоръчва CDC и моето BP никога не е било по-високо от 117/70, най-високото ми някога, нормално около 100-110/65-70. Нито един от нашите случаи не доказва по един или друг начин ефектите "висок" прием на натрий има върху общото население.<br/>Може да имате нисък клетъчен калий, висока мед, нисък витамин k2, нисък магнезий, нисък витамин Е, токсичност на тежки метали като олово, всеки е изложен на олово и флуорид, тези неща се съединяват.<br/>Погледнете условията, които ви карат да имате тази чувствителност към сол, като нисък калий висок кортизол.<br/>Не почивайте само на сол, защото вероятно ще имате множество проблеми, както и почти никой не яде сол от само себе си.<br/>Солта обикновено се намира във високи прости захари без фибри храни с добавки.<br/>Разберете насоките са за цялото население не само за вас, това е проблематично, защото нерафинираната сол не е доказано, че е нездравословна за повечето хора и за някои подобрява здравето и при вземането на тези насоки без признаване на биохимичната индивидуалност.<br/>Разберете понижаването на HBP не е всичко и в крайна сметка всичко, това е механично направено от лекарства в проучвания, които не показват подобрение на резултатите и дори влошаване на симптомите извън знака на измерването на BP.<br/>Неща, които трябва да се вземат предвид, Екстракт от маслинови листа, витамин д, витамин с, витамин к2, калий, куркума, стевия (естественият подсладител), магнезий, помегранит, L-аргинин, натокиназа, рибено масло, какао, цвекло, алфа липоева киселина, бромелаин, ленено семе, целина, coq10, ленено семе, hawthorne. Всичко това подобрява BP и сърдечно-съдови проблеми. Имате много повече в инструментариума си, отколкото си мислите<br/>Що се отнася до захарта, жените трябва да ограничат захарта си (Total Carbs е това, което има значение и внимавайте за някои захарни алкохоли) 20g-30g закуска и 30g-45g всяко хранене. Мъжете трябва да запазят закуската си същата като жените 20g-30g закуска и 60g – 75g храна. Най-ниските стойности са Imit за диабетици, разбира се.<br/>Вярвам, че някои хора имат чувствителност към натрий. Убеден съм, че е така. След като бях на 3 различни BP лекарства по едно и също време и все още имах неконтролирана хипертония, започнах да чета етикетите на храните и драстично да намалявам приема на натрий. Повечето преработени храни са заредени с натрий. Успях да спра 2 лекарства напълно и да намаля третата до 1/4 от предписаната доза. За мен намаляването на натрий е направило огромна разлика. Снощи взех 10 мг лизиноприл, което е 1/4 от предписаната дневна доза. Днес кръвното ми е твърде ниско, 105/48. Наистина трябва да го следя последователно, тъй като ниското кръвно също не е много забавно.<br/>Лекарствата за кръвно налягане са неефективни, те не успяват да подобрят резултатите само при четене на BP.<br/>Вие сте намалили приема на ниско съдържание на калий с високо съдържание на сол, високо съдържание на захар, ниско съдържание на фибри храни боклуци, това винаги е щяло да понижи кръвното ви налягане.<br/>Солта не е врагът, просто се нуждаете от калий и антиоксиданти, за да я балансирате и да намалите стреса.<br/>Когато хората намалят натрия по този начин, не можете да го допринесете за самата сол, напълно сте променили хранителния си прием на много неща, това е начинът, по който хората могат да бъдат заблудени да мислят, че това е едно нещо.<br/>Това приписване на една единствена причина на проблемите постоянно се прави в хипотезата и те са склонни да бъдат напълно фалшиви демонизиращи единствено число неща като Co2, сол, наситени мазнини, холестерол, липса на сератонин, дори липса на отрова флуориди използват.<br/>Това са все митове, които се провалят под контрол, но продължават да се поддържат като причини чрез регулиране на органите чрез бране на череши и отхвърляне на минимизирането на непреодолими противоречия. Фармацевтичните корпорации за нездравословна храна и растително масло се възползват и погрешно информират обществеността за печалба, на която рекетьорите на FDA за тях убиват конкуренцията си.<br/>Медицинските изследвания и голяма част от други изследвания са помийна яма от кръвосмесителна измама между частния интерес и стимулиране на икономиката, както и лекари политици и правителствена печалба.<br/>Редакторите на проучванията на списанията са публикувани в констатацията, че повечето изследвания са напълно липсващи, заключения, които трябва да се извъртат към пристрастия за потвърждение и че сме в доста тъмна епоха за науката, където вярата, консенсусът и партньорската проверка са по-малко за добрата наука и повече за конкуриращите се вярвания и доказателства, които ще навредят на печалбите и бъдещите безвъзмездни средства.<br/>Да, както и да е. Вярвайте каквото искате. Чета книги за здравето от години....Упадъци...и съм чел в тях точно това, което е отпечатано в тази статия. Никога не е имало доказана връзка между солта и високото кръвно налягане. Освен това в една от книгите се посочва, че солта се използва за производството на стомашна киселина и е иронично, че с напредването на възрастта, ниското съдържание на натрий в диетата толкова често води до проблеми с храносмилането.<br/>Продължавайте да вярвате на лекарите, които приемат 3 кредита от храненето в колежа и катранените съединения, които причиняват по-лоши странични ефекти от действителното заболяване.<br/>Лекари, които казват, че хиропрактиката не е истинска медицина. Прочетете статиите на Уинсдор. Един лекар, който се заел да докаже, че Чиро е фалшив, правейки аутопсии, установил, че 99 от 100 отказа на органи се дължат на липса на нервна енергия, причинена от "сублуксации", които притискат нервите и прекъсват нервния енергиен поток. (Аз не съм хиропрактор).<br/>Отиди да четеш книги от Норман Уокър, (особено "Свежи плодове и зеленчуци."), TC Fry, и Хърбърт М. Шелтън (Superior Nutrition, гладно може да спаси живота си). Аз съм ги чел всички.<br/>BOTTOM LINE това е отлична статия и всъщност съм изненадан да видя истината, така открито публикувана в статия като тази... но вярвате, че това, което искате и приемате химикали, изтласкани от медицинската професия... яжте каквото искате, пийте каквото искате, не се упражнявайте и когато нещата се объркат, просто вземете хапче....<br/>Опитах се да потърся тези "Уинсдорски документи" и дори Google не знае за какво говорите. Ако наистина искате да спечелите хора, трябва всъщност да публикувате връзки към информацията, която искате да прочетем.<br/>Момчета, всички вие пропускате една точка: натрият е отровен за нас. Дори и да не повишава кръвното налягане, все още е отрова ;/ изобщо не е добър<br/>Ще умрете незабавно без натрий в тялото си.<br/>Аз не съм същият Марко като г-н "Солта е отрова".<br/>Разбира се – всичко в излишък е лошо – дори пиенето на твърде много вода ще ви убие.<br/>Сега, всеки човек е различен, така че трябва да намерите това, което работи за вас.<br/>Тази статия е подвеждаща. Само защото отрицателното въздействие на солта върху кръвното налягане е "теория", не означава, че трябва да я игнорираме. Всъщност по-голямата част от медицината и науката се извършват на правдоподобни теории. Истината е, че диета с ниско съдържание на сол е по-малко вредна от диета с високо съдържание на сол и като всичко останало истинският морал на историята е умереността. Също така този автор противоречи на себе си, като казва, че няма "никакви доказателства... Да, никой" в подкрепа на тази теория, но след това продължава да цитира поне едно проучване, което показва отрицателния королатуон при хората и друго, включващо плъхове. По-голямата част от медицината е черна магия и много лекари ще признаят това. Разбира се, понякога сме далеч от това да знаем, но в този случай има достатъчно наука зад въздействието на солите върху BP, за да си струва да се обмисли. Също така не забравяйте, че човешката консумация на големи количества сол е сравнително ново нещо в еволюционен мащаб, така че въздействието му върху телата ни е доста неестествено.<br/>Майк: "Няма доказателства... да, няма" Мисля, че Скот има предвид "Няма реномирани доказателства" или по-скоро, "Няма доказателства, които да не са дефектни."<br/>Да, точно както Скот обича да казва, дори водата ще ви убие в достатъчно високи дози. Той дори веднъж ми разказа една история на жена, която той се опита да лекува за това точно нещо - тя пиеше огромни количества вода и в крайна сметка умираше от нея.<br/>"По-голямата част от медицината е черна магия и много лекари ще признаят това." Не мисля, че някой лекар би казал това. Може би преди век или два. Но в наши дни тук участва невероятно количество добра наука. Ние сме далеч от това да знаем всичко, но със сигурност не е черна магия или просто да предполагаме работа, както изглежда предполага това.<br/>Съжалявам, че не съм съгласен с теб, Дейв. Но дори и за източниците на видеото, повишаването на кръвното налягане на диетите с високо съдържание на сол е очевидно. Докато в края на една от тях, докато говорим за компании за безалкохолни напитки и закуски:<br/>"Някои от тези компании са били водещи в опитите си да създадат изкуствена полемика, съмнявайки се във връзката между приема на сол и кръвното налягане,16,17 вероятно с надеждата да спрат или забавят всяко намаляване на приема на сол от населението, за да защитят продажбите на безалкохолни напитки."<br/>Дори аз не съм специалист в областта, липсата на литературен преглед в източника по този въпрос е обезпокоителна.<br/>О, диети, които са преработени храни с ниско съдържание на мазнини с високо съдържание на захар добавка, наблюдателни изследвания са безсмислени, тези хора ядат обилно количество захар всяка година. Ако мислите, че корпорациите се опитват да използват повече сол, нелепото му разсейване в правенето на всичко, за да не гледат епидемията от синдрома на захарния метаболизъм.<br/>Колко малоумно, че мислите, че наблюдателните изследвания имат значение за нещо друго, освен да предложите хипотеза, след това използвате интервенционни и двойно-слепи плацебо изследвания без променливи, за да ги докажете като причинно-следствени. Това не е направено, това също не е направено за холестерол или наситени мазнини. Вие сте наивна жертва на патологичната наука, когато той казва, че няма доказателства, че няма доказателства, наблюдателните изследвания не контролират нищо, те не са експеримент, това не е начинът, по който науката работи. Нали разбирате, че кокраните са може би най-неутралната група за клинични изследвания в света и са прегледали 150 проучвания и 13 проучвания на населението. Нищо друго освен вярата ти, основана на хипотеза без доказателства.<br/>Предлагам ви да прочетете книгата "Сол". Това е най-вече геополитическо историческо описание на солта в нашата цивилизация, но също така има много наука в нея. Ние построихме нашата цивилизация на сол.<br/>Първият параграф казва: "просто осъзнайте, че това е само теория и такава, която не е подкрепена от много от каквито и да е твърди научни доказателства", вярвам, че тъй като това е научно обоснован уебсайт, той не трябва да използва думата теория в този контекст, тъй като в науката теорията е прието обяснение на явление, доказано чрез тестване.<br/>Да, трябваше да използва хипотеза, но ще трябва да проверя историята на теорията и да видя дали някой знае как е завършила с две толкова различни значения.<br/>За медицински специалист (което води до предположение за напреднало образование), имате ужасно разбиране на граматиката и правописа. Това дискредитира голяма част от това, което казвате, в съзнанието ми. Да имаш някой друг, който да преглежда работата ти, преди да публикуваш, би било дълъг път.<br/>Ще продължа да слушам кардиолога си по този въпрос и да ограничавам приема на сол.<br/>Марк: Нещо, което изглежда вярно за голям брой медицински специалисти, стереотипът, че почеркът им е ужасен, обикновено е правилен. (Скот е особено лош.) И тяхното техническо писане също понякога може да бъде особено ужасно, предварително редактирано. (Те учат медицина и човешкото тяло, не пише, в края на краищата) Но, в над 100+ статии Скот е написал, той никога не е било доказано, че е погрешно по една основна точка (и само няколко случая, че е погрешно по незначителна точка). Typos? Неловко изречение? Винаги ще намерите поне едно от тези във всяка от статиите му, въпреки най-искрените ми усилия да се отърва от всички тях. Но в крайна сметка ме е грижа за точността много повече от граматиката. И двете биха били добри, но намирането на писател с особения опит на Скот и способността му да мисли критично и да обработва огромни количества медицински познания е изключително трудно. Тези хора не са стотинка дузина.<br/>Но всъщност, силата на аргументите на Скот никога не се основава на обширните му медицински познания. Това просто му помага да проучи задълбочено различните изследвания по темата, където повечето биха се загубили в терминологията, да не говорим да може да мисли критично за тях и тяхната методология. Силата на аргумента е самите изследвания. В този случай е добре да прочетете двете рецензии на Cochrane и може би да ги препратите на вашия кардиолог за неговите/нейните мисли.<br/>Не се изненадвайте, ако той/тя вече ги е приготвил и може би дори е съгласен с тях. Това, което лекарите казват на пациентите си, не винаги съвпада с това, което всъщност знаят или вярват, че е истина. Особено в случаи като този, където съдебните дела могат да бъдат много реална възможност, ако ви кажат да ядете цялата сол, която искате, тогава сте умрели от сърдечен проблем (но нямате нищо общо със солта), след това семейството ви ги съди и цитира какво казват различни правителствени агенции по темата, а не какво всъщност мисли медицинският свят. Гледането на натрия също няма да навреди, но покрива гърба на кардиолозите. (Всъщност имах интересна дискусия за това със Скот снощи за лекар, с когото той обсъждаше това, с който каза нещо много подобно, защо въпреки че знае, че натрийът няма да бъде вреден по този начин, той все още казва на някои от пациентите си да наблюдават приема на натрий.)<br/>В крайна сметка, както винаги казвам, "Въпрос на всичко", но също така и при разпит, направете изследването, за да намерите отговорите също, и след това проверете двойно това изследване, само за да сте сигурни. И, може би, не правете грешката да сравнявате граматиката и умението за писане с познания по дадена тема или интелигентност. Работил съм с много писатели. Мога да кажа, че журналистите (и други такива хора с писателски произход) са страхотни в писането... Те почти всички са ужасни в изследванията, което ме изненада на журналистите, но може би обяснява много за състоянието на медиите, отразяващи научни изследвания. Достатъчно смешно, най-добрата комбинация от писане способност и изследвания изглежда да са адвокати. Те са феноменални както в моя опит. Учените, така и хората с научен произход, са склонни да бъдат бедни в писането, но невероятни в изследванията и критичното мислене. Разбира се, това се случва само с извадка от няколко десетки писатели, с които съм работил, и има едно изключение, което открих в това, но това е тенденция, която съм наблюдавал.<br/>Мисля, че всеки трябва да е различен. За мен солта повишава много кръвното ми налягане. Проверявам bl pr 4-6x на ден. Остава достатъчно ниско, когато остана под 300 mg сол. Веднага след като ям много сол, като китайска храна или дори месо и сирене под или две филийки пица ми bl pr отива на 170/98. Отнема няколко дни, за да извадя солта от тялото си. След това ще слезе на 130/80, а понякога и малко по-ниско. Аз съм 67.<br/>току-що предложихте неща, съдържащи големи количества прости въглехидрати, също съдържащи пшеница. Захарта има висока осмолалност, но се игнорира поради теглото, приложено към солта.<br/>Диетичното елиминиране на пшеницата само по себе си може да понижи BP с 20-40 mmHG. Удължаването на живота на компанията казва, че това също благоприятно оптимизира профилите на липидите в кръвта.<br/>Виждате ли как може би базирате това, което виждате, на предположение, базирано на това, което ви е казано, базирано на хипотезата, че няма доказателства.<br/>сърдечно-съдови проблеми в наблюдателни проучвания само намери връзка с хората, които ядат много голямо количество от 5 грама сол на ден, можете да си представите какво количество на боклуци храни те се хранят за постигане на това количество.<br/>Ако проблемът ви е солта, имате основно състояние, което я причинява, защото не получавате голямо количество по никакъв начин, но също така пренебрегвате други причини, което е проблемът, когато единичните неща се изтъкват като основен допринасящ фактор, когато няма доказателства, че те са причината.<br/>Помислете за вашия клетъчен калий, мед, излагане на олово, магнезий, прием на витамин Е, нива на coq10, дразнители и стрес, които могат да увеличат коагулацията и свиването на съдовете.<br/>Ако мога да коментирам цялата правописна/граматична полемика... в моя опит от наблюдаване на хора, населението (поне интелигентните, цялото ми семейство е с висок коефициент на интелигентност и съпругът ми е гений, буквално, и тъй като нямам приятели с по-ниско ниво на интелигентност за контролна група, мога да говоря само от наблюденията си на семейството и на съпруга си,) е разделено на два вида: математически хора и слово-хора. Баща ми беше математически човек, както и аз, когато бях много малък, обаче, живеех с майка си, която най-категорично е човек на думите, през целия ми живот, което доведе до моето развитие в човек на думите. Съпругът ми може да е най-умният човек, който някога съм срещал, но от неговия правопис, граматика и лексика, никога няма да го знаеш. Той е компютърен техник, може да поправи всичко, много гъвкав в работните си способности, може да реши проблеми с алгебрата, с които се боря за минути само с един поглед, но не мога да напиша името на сина ни.<br/>Доколкото мога да кажа, учените са склонни да бъдат математически хора повече от думи хора. (Само за протокола, една от предишните ми работни места беше изследване, а аз съм граматика нацист и сескипедиалист.<br/>Чудех се дали мога да помоля автора на тази статия за малка услуга.<br/>В началото прочетох следното изречение по отношение на приема на сол:<br/>"Но ще покрия теорията защо солта повишава кръвното налягане по-долу - просто осъзнайте, [това е само теория] и такава, която не е подкрепена от много от каквито и да е твърди научни доказателства..."<br/>Тук вие използвате "Теория" в популярния си език. WHich е добре и всичко. Проблемът е, че това е научна статия и когато една теория не се подкрепя от доказателства, ние я наричаме "Хипотеза".<br/>Тези от нас, които пишат в научната сфера, трябва да положат усилия да направят това разграничение, най-вече защото следващия път, когато получа някакъв креационист на Млада Земя, който ми казва, че еволюцията е "просто теория", се кълна, че ще започна да скачам нагоре-надолу като шимпанзе и да правя назад самеро. Тогава ще хвърлям изпражнения по него/нея.<br/>Сигурен съм, че не искаш такава сцена да се превърне в реалност.<br/>Така че нека да започнем кампания, за да наречем една теория "съгласувана група от тествани общи предложения, обикновено считани за правилни, които могат да бъдат използвани като принципи за обяснение и предвиждане за клас явления" и да наречем всичко, което е предназначено да бъде изтеглено от задния отвор "хипотеза".<br/>BTW: Знам, че речникът връща и двете значения. FOr в името на науката, нека да променим значението обратно, тъй като вече имаме добра работна дума за "Току-що извадих това от задника си".<br/>Ще започна да работя по това разграничение в бъдещи статии.<br/>Нито едно легитимно заключение не може да бъде направено от едно измерване на кръвното налягане. BP варира значително дори от момент на момент. Много пъти съм виждал 160/100 спад до 130/75 в течение на няколко минути. Също така, измервателното оборудване на BP е силно променливо и податливо на широки вариации от неща като размер на маншета и потребителски вариации.<br/>Всички заключения, направени от няколко измервания, не са нищо повече от спекулации и пожелателно мислене.<br/>Първо, това не е рецензирана статия в дневника. Съгласен съм, правилното използване на "теория" е замъглено от разговорната "просто предчувствие". Но, нека продължим, ок?<br/>Не разбирам, че статията е ни най-малко подвеждаща. Разбирам, че авторът изтъква, че очевидно се губи на много – "Както е посочено, в момента няма солидни доказателства, че солта хронично ще повиши кръвното ви налягане. Да, никаква."<br/>Той също така споменава, че мисли критично. Така че, ако не му вярвате, а) продължете с вярата си, или б) разберете сами. Направете работата по краката. Прочетете статиите. Сега имате отправна точка. Благодарете му за това.<br/>По мое мнение, фокусирането върху случайната граматическа грешка или дебата "теория срещу предчувствие" ненужно намалява намерението на автора. Моето заключение е, че тази статия помага да се оспорят моите предположения за това, което мислех, че вече е научно приключило. Научих нещо, това е смисълът.<br/>Майкъл Стели Не съм сигурен дали имахте предвид конкретно моя пост по отношение на употребата на "теория", но ви уверявам, че моят коментар изобщо не е имал за цел да критикува писателя. Поне не в същите термини като граматически или правописни "грешка".<br/>Моят коментар не е за "грешка", а по-скоро е предложение, че тези от нас, които четат и пишат за науката, правят нашата част, за да възстановят използването на думата "теория" от мейнстрийма или че поне се опитваме.<br/>Има такива, които коментират очевидни правописни грешки и съм съгласен, че те не са важни в контекста на информацията, предоставена в статията (въпреки че съм съгласен, че могат да бъдат разсейващи и говоря от човек, който не е роден английски), но освен ако техният брой и характер не е такъв, че да направят разбирането на статията трудно или дори невъзможно, няма да ме намерите да публикувам за тях.<br/>Думата "теория" от друга страна е дума, която се използва активно от определени фракции на дискусията наука / религия, за да се намали 200 години научен напредък и тя се използва активно, за да подведе децата в дисконтиране на науката като цяло.<br/>Ако сте гледали дебата Nye – Ham, Gawker помоли някои креационисти да напишат въпрос към поддръжниците на еволюцията на лист хартия и те публикуваха тези въпроси под формата на снимки. Неизменно се появи въпросът "това е просто теория".<br/>Именно в този дух помолих кураторите на този сайт да се опитат да използват думата в нейното научно значение. Ако ние в областта на науката и техниката не направим това, не можем да очакваме тези, които искат да изкривят науката за целите си, да го направят сами.<br/>Така че, с цялото ми уважение, няма да послушам съвета ви, със сигурност ще допусна глупави правописни грешки, но това е важно за мен и трябва да е важно за всички нас, които обичаме науката.<br/>Никой не изкривява науката повече от еволюционистите, изводите и спекулациите, основани на предположение за факт, не са доказателство. Никое поле няма толкова измами и предположения, колкото еволюцията.<br/>Продължавайки да използваме опорочения контрастиращ аргумент и предположението, че тъй като творението трябва да е погрешно, еволюцията трябва да е вярна, не е наука, доказателствата не показват макроеволюцията да е възможна в този момент при някоя от многото настоящи конкуриращи се теории, основани единствено на мутация и естествен подбор. Предлагам да се намери друг механизъм.<br/>Тъй като тя стои противоречиви доказателства е напълно игнорирани или дори твърди като доказателство за по-сложен процес, но все още доказателство за еволюцията, когато това не е такова нещо във всички случаи.<br/>Понастоящем имаме доказателства за абиогенезата, че това е абсолютен факт, както е и микроеволюцията абсолютно вярна, но по отношение на макроеволюцията бих предложил науката да се върне към това да се основава на доказателства, а не на предположение за факт и изкривяване на данни, за да го предизвика твърде отговаря на теорията.<br/>В сегашния си вид еволюцията не е наука, а е вярване, подобно на теорията за Големия взрив, която има масивни противоречиви доказателства, че в миналото, когато хората са използвали доказателства, за да докажат или опровергаят теории, тази теория би била отложена, комбинацията от двете тези теории е подобна на религия, религията на светските хуманисти. Тя е толкова политическа, колкото идват общностите, които поддържат тези вярвания черна топка и ad hominem те не могат да стоят на доказателствата, но на сплашване. Проучванията показват, че ad hominem е толкова полезен, колкото и обоснованият аргумент, това се използва от неграмотната наука, като например базирания на Co2 климатичен алармизъм и макроеволюцията, които в момента нямат доказателства в тяхна полза, но все пак използват същите видове пропаганда и атаки, предполагащи, че всеки, който им се противопоставя, е антинаука или идиот.<br/>Предлагам да прочетете http://www.scienceagasnevolution.org<br/>Хората, които не са съгласни с еволюцията, не вярват автоматично в сътворението, еволюционистът винаги напада и отвлича вниманието от собствения си слаб аргумент, създава свой сламен човек на това, в което другите вярват и допуска въз основа на собствените си често идиотски предположения, че те са подкрепени от доказателства, когато те не са.<br/>Един факт бих искал да добавя:<br/>Тиазидните и тиазидно-подобните диуретици са още едно доказателство в тази полемика. Интересното е, че тиазидите се наричат диуретици, но когато се приемат ежедневно, този диуретичен ефект става почти нулев. След период на хронична терапия с тиазиди, основната полза от тези лекарства е, че те увеличават елиминирането на натриевите и хлоридните йони от кръвта чрез Na/Cl симпортера в дисталните заплетени тубули (заедно с други ефекти като задържане на калций). Въпреки загубата на диуретичния ефект тиазидите запазват своите понижаващи кръвното ефекти в дългосрочен план и са едно от лекарствата, използвани от първа линия за понижаване на кръвното налягане. Този понижаващ ефект обикновено се приписва на елиминирането на натрий и изглежда е в съответствие с идеята, че високите нива на натрий повишават кръвното налягане.<br/>Ако ям прекалено много чипс, ще ми се завие свят от ниското кръвно.<br/>Тази "теория" е просто глупава. Солта наистина увеличава кръвното налягане! Това е факт, наблюдаван, наблюдаван. Случайно яде някои доста солени неща един ден, отколкото е необходимо една седмица на диуретици, за да се отърве от всички, че сол от тялото и да донесе на кръвното налягане от 190-200 (!!да, че високо го имам!!!) обратно към нормалното (120-130). Така че не разказвай истории, които не са верни.<br/>Не всички хора реагират еднакво на диетична сол. Моето предложение за нас е да се вземе под внимание нивото на натрий в нашите нормални лабораторни резултати в минимални годишни физически упражнения.<br/>От детството съм свикнал да вземам повече сол с храната си, но никога не съм се сблъсквал с проблема с високото кръвно налягане, вместо това понякога минава под нормалното. Потърсих в Гугъл този проблем и стигнах до заключението, че тялото ми се нуждае от сол повече от нормалното, за да компенсира генетично предавания проблем с ниското кръвно налягане. Така че? Вашият мозък е инструкторът за вашето здраве. Трябва да следвате неговите заповеди, за да останете наистина здрави!<br/>Е, аз съм просто диетолог (като университетска специалност по хранене, която ще се дипломира през май) и може би това, което научих, е бик, но след като се замислих за патофизиологията за това как натрийът може да повлияе на кръвното налягане, намирам, че препоръката има смисъл, но ще трябва да направите повече от просто да намалите натрия. Едно нещо, което е важно, е съотношението натрий: калий (т.е. ядете куп високо преработени, натриеви добавени храни в сравнение с пресни или замразени плодове и зеленчуци). Ще призная, че не всеки е чувствителен към солта и че съзнателно сме решили, в областта на здравеопазването, да приемем, че всеки е, защото тестването за чувствителност към солта (ако това е дума!) е скъпо, дълго и непрактично. Но идеята, че няма добри правдоподобни доказателства, свързващи солта и хипертонията, е невярна. Това не са тези, които са дадени от нашите професори да четат (макар че ако искате да ги намеря за вас, сигурен съм, че мога), но те са добри все пак и не се нуждаете от специален университетски код или членство, за да получите достъп до тях. Както и да е, заповядайте в случай, че искате да прочетете повече:<br/>Казвате, че "ще трябва да направите нещо повече от това просто да намалите натрия"... има ли доказателства, че правенето на тези други действия, без да намалите натрия, не работи толкова добре, колкото да намалите и натрия?<br/>Не сте ли чели? Cochrane използва 150 проучвания и 13 проучвания нали? така че имате 6, това е вашето "образование" в работата. Промиване на мозъка и след това потвърждение предубедено търсене за подкрепа на дефектната хипотеза, която вече е установено, че не е с високо качество.<br/>Ако Cochrane не го е използвал, това не е висококачествена статия, ако го е направил, тогава подкрепата не е била значителна в статията. Механизмът на осмолалитета се прилага за диети с висока захар, но всичко за солта<br/>Проблемът тук е, че изследванията с ниско качество се публикуват постоянно, че хората правят извод за причинно-следствената връзка от мястото, където не могат да го направят, тъй като не контролират всички променливи.<br/>Същото се прави и за липидната и холестеролната хипотеза.<br/>Това също са митове, холестеролът от всички данни е обратно свързан със сърдечните заболявания леко.<br/>Абсолютното намаляване на риска от сърдечни заболявания при статини е 1,4%, това едва ли е значително, ефектите на статини за намаляване на сърдечните проблеми при тези, които вече имат сърдечен удар, могат да се дължат изцяло на ефекта им като антикоагулант. За пореден път патологичната наука за боклуците се използва, за да се прокарат лечения, без да се разпознават механизмите и променливите. Повечето хора ще бъдат увредени от инхибиране на витамин k coq10 и синтеза на холестерол чрез статини, но лекарите, подкрепени от фармацевтичната алчност, ги дават на всички.<br/>Наситените мазнини нямат механизъм, чрез който могат да повишат холестерола, нито едно изследване на заместителя на маслото не контролира всички променливи и колкото повече се приближават до това, толкова по-лоши стават резултатите от интервенцията на PUFA, увеличавайки всички причини за смърт.<br/>Както се казва, опитите са с ниско качество, няма много воля за преобръщане на хипотезата, че регулиращите органи и лекарите имат религиозна вяра в това, което не е подкрепено с доказателства. Тази дезинформация води до лоша здравна и фармацевтична печалба.<br/>Аз съм разкъсван между това да ям повече сол или не, защото яденето на повече сол намалява сърдечната честота и кръвното налягане и ме кара да спя по-добре; ръцете и краката ми се чувстват пълни и топли. Обемът на потта ми се увеличава, докато карам колело или ходя. Но след това, след като го приемате за една седмица или 2 след това забелязвам, че BP става упорито високо; което ме кара да се чувствам, че съм направил погрешно с яденето. Това, което тази статия споменава, е увеличаване на обема на течностите, което е интересно. Преди да увелича приема на сол пръстите ми се чувстват тънки. Може би след като нивата на течности се почувстват нормални, намаляват солта до нормални нива. Така че аз съм просто хипотеза, че хората, които имат сол чувствителни имат добър обем течност и трябва да гледате прием на сол, други могат да вземат сол, но спрете, когато тя се чувства пълна. Основно използвайте сол поддържа обема на течността.<br/>Въз основа на самоекспериментацията, мисля, че поддържането на обема на течностите е много важно. Понякога откривам, че се чувствам жаден и пия вода и че тя продължава да излиза; това изисква някакъв прием на сол. По принцип не ям консерви или много бързи храни, моят прием на сол е това, което е целенасочено добавено в готвенето. След тренировка, (яденето по учебник и тренировките и т.н. също причиняват проблеми) Забелязвам, че когато се изправя от седнало положение, се чувствам замаяна, но не нормално. Мисля, че може да се потя сол и, разбира се, пия много вода по време на упражнението. Не предлагам да ядете повече сол. Това, което заявявам, е начинът, по който тялото ви казва, че солта ви е изчерпана, е когато не се чувствате напълно в краката и ръцете си. Мисля, че това е вярно до известна степен, тъй като тялото работи повече върху концентрацията на нещата, отколкото върху абсолютните количества. Това не е цялостна теория, тъй като има и други неща, които могат да увеличат обема на кръвта, може би вече имате твърде много сол в кръвта и т.н. За протокола, натрият ми в кръвта винаги е близо до ниския край на диапазона, така че грешката ми няма да ме изтласка извън диапазона.<br/>Добре, какъв е изводът? Използвам ли солницата сега или не? Държах твърде дълго.<br/>Мисля, че тази статия е безотговорна в това, че солта абсолютно повишава BP при тези, които имат чувствителност към сол. Ако ям нещо много солено, буквално мога да изпадна в хипертонична криза за един час.<br/>Този тип чувствителност е често срещан и да не го споменаваме (защото не се вписва в теорията на авторите?) е опасно.<br/>Джим Портър: "защото не се вписва в теорията на авторите?" "Теорията на авторите" не съществува. Това наистина не е това, което правим тук. Това е статия, която просто пише за научни изследвания по темата и казва това, което те казват, така че не е нужно да се пресее през тях и всички медицински жаргон; ние го правим за вас- по същество това, което пишем за отразява текущото състояние на човешкото познание по темата под ръка. Ако се промени в някакъв момент, актуализираме статията. В този случай, обаче, най-вече двете прегледи на Cochrane са доста убедителни: "След повече от 150 случайни клинични изпитвания и 13 популационни проучвания без и очевиден сигнал в полза на намаляването на натрий, друга позиция може да бъде да се приеме, че такъв сигнал може да не съществува." Има изключения от всяко правило, и на пръв поглед вие сте едно и това е много интересно, ако е така и би било интересно да научим основната причина. Но, отново, ние разглеждаме какво казват научните изследвания и се опитваме да отразим това в това, което пишем. По същество ние пишем форма на "леко четене" стил забавни проучвания документи по теми, а не пишат научни статии.<br/>Стресирането за солта вероятно ще ви убие много преди самата сол да го направи. Правете това, което ви прави щастливи и вероятно ще живеете по-дълго, отколкото иначе; и дори и да не го направите, поне ще се насладите на времето, което имате.<br/>Вярвам, че проблемът е, когато солта се смесва с мазнини и това причинява високо кръвно налягане. Например, някой говори за тяхното покачване, когато яде чипс / чипс - това е така, защото чиповете съдържат мазнини. Същото се отнася и за пържените картофи или други мазни ястия. Ако обаче поръсите сол върху нещо като плодове, това няма да има същия ефект и няма да повиши кръвното ви налягане.<br/>Мисля, че натрият получава лош рап, а някои хора всъщност консумират твърде малко. Мисля, че като сол с плодове или салати е добре, но проблемът е комбинацията сол / мазнини и ако се замислите, това е мястото, където хората обикновено получават своите сол в картофен чипс, пържени картофи, силно подправки меса, в кремави ястия и т.н.<br/>Човекът, който е написал тази статия, не добавя нищо ценно към дискусията за високото кръвно налягане, освен да насърчава хората да забиват главите си в пясъка.<br/>Боря се с високо кръвно налягане в продължение на около 12 години, тъй като сериозен инцидент ме накара да бъда физически неактивен за около година след инцидента.<br/>Високото кръвно налягане може да се контролира със и без лекарства и хората реагират различно на различни лечения и има естествени лекове за това страдание.<br/>Високото кръвно налягане може да причини инсулти, мозъчни кръвоизливи и да допринесе за диабет и бъбречни заболявания.<br/>Балансът между калий и натрий в кръвта ни е много критичен и за съжаление повечето лекари нямат представа за ефекта, който храненето и правилната хидратация имат върху това състояние.<br/>Повечето от лекарите, които съм бил, просто са давали рецепти, които могат или не могат да работят.<br/>Има естествени вещества, които ми позволиха да понижа кръвното си налягане в рамките на няколко дни от изключително високо до почти нормално, докато лекарите и фармацевтите ще кажат, че лекарствата (като Cozaar и Norvasc) могат да отнемат до един месец, за да работят.<br/>Открих, че сокът от един лимон с жар или етерично масло, добавен към 16 унции минерална вода, има значителен ефект.<br/>Пиенето на това веднъж или два пъти на ден имаше много значим ефект в моя случай; кръвното ми налягане се повиши от 220/95 на 130/90 в рамките на 3 дни.<br/>Чесънът (дезодориран) също помага и плодовите или зеленчукови сокове с понижено съдържание на сол и високо съдържание на калий също помагат. (V-8 ниска сол или V-8 зелен).<br/>Това не е самозалъгване; това е свързано с химията; това не означава, че всички ще реагират еднакво на тези лечения, но не съм съгласен много категорично, когато някой казва, че солта няма ефект върху кръвното налягане.<br/>Това ми се струва безотговорно и кавалерско, освен ако, разбира се, не работите за някой от производителите на сол.<br/>Солта е необходима и повечето трапезни соли имат йод в тях, който е основно хранително вещество за хората.<br/>Пиенето на достатъчно количество чиста вода също е много важно; нещо, което лекарите ми никога не си направиха труда да споменат.<br/>Това дава възможност на тялото да се отърве от излишната сол и помага на тялото да се очисти.<br/>Има много естествени вещества и някои храни (като песто), които могат да помогнат за понижаване на кръвното налягане и можете да намерите много публикации в интернет за тях.<br/>Web Md и The Mayo Clinic имат публикации по темата и им вярвам много повече от автора на този пост.<br/>Това ми се струва като упражнение в защита на незащитимото.<br/>С каква цел?<br/>Кой по дяволите е Хипократ и какво е знаел?<br/>Имам изключително ниско кръвно налягане. Ако се изправя твърде бързо, ще припадна по лицето си. Лекарят ми каза да ям толкова сол, колкото искам, без притеснения.<br/>Във всеки случай, ще приема всички тези съвети с щипка... знаеш ли какво. ;-D<br/>Ям много сол (и наистина имам предвид *LOT*). Преди няколко години, след като ми писна постоянно да ми се казва колко лошо е това, реших да го тествам. Като доктор знам как научно да планирам тест и в продължение на няколко месеца минимизирайки колкото се може повече променливи, тествах кръвното си налягане, докато бях на редовния си прием на сол срещу нисък прием на сол. Резултатите бяха почти както се очакваше, въпреки че някои хора /може/ са леко нетолерантни към относително високи нива на прием на сол, за мен нямаше никаква разлика. Върнах се към яденето на храна по начина, по който ми харесва (солена), и казвам на всеки, който съветва против това, те просто не знаят какво говорят за LOL<br/>Аз съм 27 жена. Започнах да имам високо кръвно налягане, докато вземах Accutane преди година и половина (Accutane увеличава натрупването на холестерол). Това, което преживях, беше интензивно, пулсът ми беше в 120bpm, бях замаян, ръцете ми се стягаха в необичайна форма на нокът и те затръпваха, докато не загубиха чувство. Мислех, че всъщност умирам. Казаха ми, че е просто пристъп на паника, но никога не съм имал истински проблеми с тревожността. Дадоха ми кислород за цял час, когато изведнъж започнах да жадувам за сол. Помолих приятеля си да изтича до Макдоналд и да ми донесе допълнителни солени картофки. В рамките на минути след като изядох всичката тази сол, кръвното ми налягане се нормализира, ръцете ми се върнаха и можех да ходя и да дишам нормално отново.<br/>Намирам, че нещата, които го предизвикват най-много за мен, са липсата на сън, да не ям нищо по цял ден, царевица, пшеница и химически соли като MSG. Но морската сол и нормалната готварска сол не го влошават, те го правят по-добре! С това казано, винаги съм имал резултати от кръвни тестове, показващи високи нива на калий. Може ли това по някакъв начин да е замесено? Моят д-р Просто го свива като причинено от любовта ми към картофите и цитрусовите плодове хаха<br/>Може да се наложи нов лекар с високо съдържание на калий или хиперкалиемия може да причини епизодите, които описвате и Accutane може да причини хиперкалиемия.<br/>Калият и натрийът очевидно са свързани, тъй като вашите клетки постоянно ги обменят във и извън клетките, за да поддържат по-високи вътреклетъчни концентрации на калий.<br/>Кортизолът, който се повишава с лишаване от сън, не се храни и други стресове обръща този процес на концентрация на калий в клетката, но има за цел да увеличи екскрецията на калий, клетъчното поемане на абсорбцията на натрий и задържането на натрий в бъбреците, може да има нещо нередно с този процес, като калий не се отделя. Нормалната причина е инхибирането на ренин-ангиотензин системата, която регулира кръвното налягане.<br/>Солта подхранва надбъбречните жлези, но може да искате да получите още повече витамин С, който е концентриран там, както и в хипофизата, тъй като те регулират кортизола и вит с понижава кортизола и стрес вероятно намаляване на тежестта на епизодите.<br/>Неща, които трябва да се търсят, магнезий, витамин д, надбъбречната жлеза, мед / цинк нива, бъбреците и надбъбречната функция.<br/>Фармацевт тук. Благодаря ви за всички полезни коментари на този сайт. Човек може да види всички интелигентно написани постове от хора, които са намалили високото си кръвно налягане чрез ограничаване на солта. Аз съм един от тези хора. Кръвното ми налягане преди година беше средно 180/120, когато не се лекувах, и когато бях на 3 различни лекарства, средно 140/90. След като се почувствах ужасно, или от нежелани ефекти от лекарствата, или от главоболие от високо кръвно налягане, реших да променя диетата си. Резултатите, които постигнах, бяха зашеметяващи. Кръвното налягане е напълно нормално, 120/80. Без главоболие или чувство, че гърлото ми е подуто, или чувство, че главата ми е твърде гореща... можех да продължа и да продължа. Направих това с НЕ скъпи продукти. Просто, доколкото е възможно в днешно време в САЩ, ядох непреработени храни и избягвах цялата добавена сол. Забележете, всички "добавени" сол. Както много правилно посочиха, солта е необходима за човешкия живот. И много храни естествено съдържат цялата сол, от която се нуждаем, така че не е необходимо да се добавят такива. Слушайки тези предполагаеми експерти, се чудя как са оцелели хората преди 10 000 години, ако не са имали късмета да намерят солен блок, който да облизват всеки ден! Четох един коментар за някой, който е имал добри резултати от "сока на един лимон с жар или етерично масло, добавен към 16 унции минерална вода". Бих предизвикал него и други просто да опитат лимоновия сок с вода. Намирам, че ако се почиствам само с една чаша лимонена вода веднъж седмично, това е имало прекрасен ефект върху здравето ми. Другите съставки може да помогнат, но това би било интересен експеримент за вас. Така че аз, като много, много други, съм чувствителен към сол. Може би някои хора могат да ядат огромно количество сол редовно без неблагоприятни последици за здравето. Това не е вярно за много от нас и е обидно, когато така наречените "професионалисти" или "учени" оспорват това. Едно нещо винаги казвам на пациентите си: "Когато става въпрос за вашето здраве, доверете се на себе си над всички останали". Ако сте убедени, че дадено лекарство ви кара да се чувствате зле и вашият лекар или фармацевт предполага, че всичко е в главата ви, вярвайте на себе си, а не на тях. Ако вие, като мен, се чувствате хиляди пъти по-добре, когато ограничавате консумацията на сол или преработени храни, тогава моля, продължавайте да правите това, което правите, и не слушайте тези, които предполагат друго! Ще бъдете по-здрави и по-щастливи. Благодаря, че ме изслушахте, приятели отдалеч.<br/>Макар че със сигурност е възможно да сте чувствителни към солта, когато сте решили да промените диетата си, сте променили много други неща в допълнение към това колко сол сте яли. Два от най-лесните начини за понижаване на кръвното налягане, без да променяте солта, са 1. Отслабнете. 2. Яжте повече зеленчуци и плодове (известни още като храни, богати на калий). Многобройни клинични и наблюдателни проучвания показват, че съотношението натрий-калий вероятно е по-важно от това колко натрий ядете. [Забележете, че това се отнася само за 99,999999% от човечеството, което яде между 3k и 6k mg натрий на ден. Солта вероятно е проблем, ако ядете начин извън нормалния диапазон, като 12,000mg + натрий на ден.]<br/>Щях да кажа едно и също нещо. Имах високо кръвно налягане... направих 30-дневно палео предизвикателство... Всички чисти от земята храни. Всъщност увеличих приема на сол чрез въвеждане на много солено говеждо месо пастърма и маринована храна в диетата ми за закуска. Не само, че кръвното ми налягане се оказа почти перфектно... аз също загубих 16 паунда. Дори не бях някой, който наистина би обмислил наднорменото тегло, за да започне с... 178 паунда до 162 паунда за 30 дни. Странните ми главоболия изчезнаха... всичките девет ярда, които идват с високо кръвно налягане. Убеден съм, че солта и кръвното налягане не са свързани... и мисля, че е ченге за хора, които наистина трябва да се качат на истинска здравословна диета.<br/>Тази статия е опасна и може да убеди някой да използва всичката сол, която иска. Но всичко, което трябва да направя, е да изям няколко големи торби с картофен чипс и получавам 180/90 в рамките на няколко дни, да остана извън солта след това за 3-4 дни и да се хидратирам добре, обратно до 130/70. Сега "може би" съм свръхчувствителен, но тъй като това се е повтаряло половин дузина пъти, избягвам солта. Има много в нормалните храни /<br/>Изглежда, че не знаете за какво говорите... прочетете Curt Nicol DD PhD запис по-долу. и прочетете отново тази статия... сте били пристрастни от излагане на лекарите, които са се пристрастили от години и години на всички yada..yada... прочетете статията отново. Разбира се, няма да започнеш да ядеш сол на килограм... всичко ще е ужасно на вкус така или иначе.<br/>Това, което е опасно, са съвети и лечения без научна основа, основани само на хипотезата, съпътстващият ефект от намаляването на редовния прием на сол на повечето хора е консумирането на по-малко преработени храни, съдържащи огромни количества рафинирани или прости въглехидрати, силно окисляващи масла, денатурирани вещества, замърсители и добавки.<br/>Намаляването им ще доведе до подобряване на цялостното хранене.<br/>Ограничаването на солта сама по себе си без други променливи ще покаже малко или никакъв ефект при повечето хора и може да бъде пагубно за другите.<br/>Аз да. Въведох детайлен коментар за стоп и старт тестове, които 100% доказаха хипотезата ми, че На е един от големите причинители на кръвното налягане. Необходими са усилия за документиране и записване на методите и резултата. Моят беше по-висок от 205/115. Снижих го до 100/65 за две години. Работата ми е документирана в тази секция за коментари, но все още не се е появила.<br/>Много хора тук казват, че яденето на пакет чипс повишава кръвното им налягане. Не осъзнават ли, че това не е здравословна храна? Дали смятат, че вероятно не съдържа всички грешни неща?<br/>Трябва да има и други храни с високо съдържание на натрий, които могат да използват, за да покажат как солта влияе на кръвното им налягане.<br/>Точно така... лошо е маслото и мазнината, които отиват по тръбите и ги ограничават... плюс картофен чипс, всичко е нишесте, което се превръща в захар, след това мазнини...<br/>Не бих бил достатъчно доверчив, за да мисля и за минута, че солта НЕ е свързана с високо кръвно налягане и повишени температури на тялото, защото със сигурност го прави. Намалих кръвното си налягане със 160 на 80 до 119 на 81 за няколко седмици, като намалих сериозно приема на сол. Защо всеки път, когато ям няколко порции картофен чипс или ям пържените картофки на Мак Доналд, веднага се изчервявам и трескаво? Дори съм усещал и чувал, да, свитите вени в собствената ми глава, след като имах високо кръвно налягане, разширявах се, разширявах се и отново се отварях, след като пиех чаши и чаши вода, с изчезването на треската, изчезването на дискомфорта или претовареното усещане в главата и намаленото кръвно налягане.<br/>Това наистина ме притеснява и трябва да призная, че съм малко объркан сега. Обичам солта и мога да консумирам повече в едно хранене, отколкото се предполага, че трябва да консумирате за един ден. Никога не изглеждаше да засяга моето БП.<br/>След това, когато кръвното ми започна да се увеличава с напредването на възрастта, докторът ми каза да изрежа солта. Всъщност бях приет в болница със сериозна инфекция, само за да открия, че когато бях изписан, бях държан на диета с ниско съдържание на натрий, въпреки че при приемането ми нивото на натрий беше опасно ниско.<br/>Всичко това ме накара да повярвам, че опасностите от натрия са само мит, поне за мен така или иначе. Но тогава жена ми се разболя. Нейното БП постоянно се наблюдаваше, тъй като продължаваше да върви твърде ниско. Те я инжектираха със "солена" (солена вода, вярвам) и кръвното й налягане щеше да се повиши почти веднага. Това обаче беше интравенозно.<br/>Така че това е, че аз не съм сол-чувствителен, или е нещо за стомаха, който действа на s бариера (така погълната сол не ви засяга), докато IV сол ще?<br/>За нещо, което е толкова фундаментално в медицинските съвети, това е толкова разочароващо, че изглежда има толкова малко изследвания, поне качествени изследвания, направени върху него.<br/>Обратно, на по-късен прием в болница, те ме имаха на ниско съдържание на натрий отново (веднъж и идиот го поставя на вашите медицински досиета, изглежда невъзможно да го свали...) и ми даде лекарство за намаляване на кръвното налягане. Кръвното ми падна през пода и ги тревожеше на един етап.<br/>BP лекарства не са доказани за подобряване на резултатите или да бъдат безопасни в повечето ситуации. Съвременната медицина е доста опасно те убиват хората постоянно с това, което те предписват.<br/>Съпругата ви може да има проблеми с бъбреците и надбъбречните жлези, докато по-вероятно имате съдови проблеми. Обмислете възможните причини за околната среда, пиете вода с флуорид, който увеличава абсорбцията на олово, липсата на антиоксиданти като ала, вит a/e/c/d/k2 може да доведе до повишена оксидативна стресова артериална склероза и калцификация на артериите, ограничавайки способността на везилите да набират, повишеното дразнещо излагане повишава вазоконстрикцията и коагулацията чрез повишено отделяне на сератонин и по-ниски нива на азотен оксид, произвеждан от ендотелиалните увреждания, ниския синтез.<br/>Тези неща могат да причинят проблеми навсякъде.<br/>Току-що прекарах един час в писане на коментар. Лекарят ми желае да го види. Не се появявам. Какво става? Губя ли си времето? Моля, отговорете.<br/>Отлична статия. Статии от този тип извеждат на здравето ядки и know-it-alls....просто погледнете коментарите. Това също ми напомня за "глобалното затопляне"....изменение на климата" (или както го наричат тази седмица) "експерти", които го проповядват сякаш е евангелие, когато те също нямат категорично доказателство. |
| Nomadic Kirghiz. Golodnaia Steppe.<br/>This remarkable photograph shows a nomadic Kyrgyz family resting in the steppe grasslands. The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group widely spread over the area of eastern Turkestan. The man, with weathered face, is dressed in a skullcap and a frayed traditional striped coat. He is burdened with padded blankets and probably a small tent. The woman, with brilliant white turban, wears a tattered cloak and carries smaller bundles of blankets and clothes. Their small boy wears a colorful skullcap and a sparkling green silk jacket in the Chinese style. To the left is a desert thorn bush. The image is by Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863–1944), who used a special color photography process to create a visual record of the Russian Empire in the early 20th century. Some of Prokudin-Gorskii’s photographs date from about 1905, but the bulk of his work is from between 1909 and 1915, when, with the support of Tsar Nicholas II and the Ministry of Transportation, he undertook extended trips through many different parts of the empire. In 1911 he made two trips to an area of Central Asia then known as Turkestan (present-day Uzbekistan and neighboring states), where he photographed Islamic architectural monuments as well as Russian development projects, such as an irrigation scheme to make Golodnaia Steppe (“Hungry Steppe”) a productive area for raising cotton and wheat.<br/>Photo: Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.<br/>- acku Afghanistan<br/>- Image Size<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>- Contained in galleries | Номадски киргизки степ.<br/>Тази забележителна снимка показва номадско киргизко семейство, почиващо в степните пасища.

Някои от фотографиите на Прокудин-Горски датират от около 1905 г., но по-голямата част от работата му е от 1909 до 1915 г., когато с подкрепата на цар Николай II и Министерството на транспорта предприема продължителни пътувания през много различни части на империята. През 1911 г. прави две пътувания до област от Централна Азия, известна тогава като Туркестан (днешен Узбекистан и съседните държави), където снима ислямски архитектурни паметници, както и руски проекти за развитие, като схема за напояване, за да направи Голодная степ („Гладна степ") продуктивна зона за отглеждане на памук и пшеница.<br/>Снимка: Сергей Михайлович Прокудин-Горский.<br/>- Аку Афганистан<br/>- Размер на изображението<br/>- 1800х1667 / 693.3КБ<br/>- Съдържа се в галериите |
| Prescribed burning is a tool used in native landscapes and commercial timberlands across the world. There are many reasons why a land manager might use prescribed burning to enhance or manage the land.<br/>One of the most beneficial results of prescribed burning, regardless of the intended end goal, is the reduction of fuel loads in the case a wildfire breaks out. Wildfires can be devastating for urban and rural communities across the country. In 2020, one of the worst most recent wildfire seasons in the United States, nearly 18,000 structures were lost to out-of-control fires, over half of those being homes. In the last decade, it has cost between $1.5 billion and $3 billion dollars each year for federal wildfire suppression tactics, including equipment and personnel.<br/>The top 10 most destructive fires by financial losses have occurred in California, with the largest being the 2018 Camp Fire, which incurred over $10.4 billion in expenses for those affected. Wildfires aren’t just financially impactful, they can cause major environmental damage and be a nuisance to general human activities.<br/>Of course, raging fires burning in the area means that road closures are likely, which impacts travel. In addition, smoke generated by wildfires can have strong effects on communities even hundreds of miles away as it is carried in the atmosphere. This can drop ash and particulate matter and impacts air quality, making it difficult for many to be outside. Communication can be impacted if fires approach telephone lines, cellphone towers, or even energy distribution centers.<br/>You can see why minimizing wildfires would result in a reduction to impacts to human activity.<br/>Environmental damage can be significant since wildfires often burn large swaths of lands, are high intensity, and have severe impacts. In 2020, nearly 60,000 fires in the United States, impacting over 10 million acres on the east and west coast. Typically more fires in the eastern states, but these fires are smaller in size and generally are less severe. Western states see marginally fewer fires than the East, but the western fires can be more intense and consume more acreage at once. This regional difference is generally seen because of the landscapes, the types of plants and fuel available to burn, as well as weather differences, particularly drought conditions. Wildfires impact plant communities and wildlife in the area, and overall have a negative influence on the environment.<br/>It may seem weird to fight fire with fire, but there are “good fires” and “bad fires.” Prescribed burning are like a prescription written by a doctor — the “doctor” in this case being the land manager. The prescription details what the goals of the burn are, the weather conditions when the burn should be conducted for the best results and least human impact, and the intensity of the fire to achieve the results.<br/>This prescription means that the fire will occur in a safe, controlled way with little impact on the environment or humans.<br/>Prescribed fire does more than just prevent raging wildfires, it can also benefit native landscapes, improve food sources and habitat for wildlife, or control underbrush in timber stands. Many native plants across the world are designed for fire to occur, since fires would naturally occur long before human intervention. Some plants need fire for their seed pods to open, some need other plants to be cleared out by fire so their seeds can germinate and succeed, while others are designed to withstand fire with thick, insulating bark or waxy foliage.<br/>Prescribed burners can tell you many stories of deer, turkey, quail, and other wildlife coming in immediately after a fire to consume plants and insects. Wildlife also benefit from improved nutrition in plants and better habitats in areas regenerating after a fire.<br/>Prescribed fire might be a beneficial tool for your land too. Reach out to your local forest service or prescribed burn association to see how prescribed burning might be implemented on your property.

Има много причини, поради които управителят на земята може да използва предписаното изгаряне, за да подобри или управлява земята.<br/>Един от най-благоприятните резултати от предписаното изгаряне, независимо от предвидената крайна цел, е намаляването на товарите с гориво в случай на избухване на горски пожар. Горските пожари могат да бъдат опустошителни за градските и селските общности в цялата страна. През 2020 г., един от най-тежките сезони на горски пожари в САЩ, близо 18 000 структури са загубени от неконтролируеми пожари, повече от половината от които са домове. През последното десетилетие тя струва между 1,5 и 3 милиарда долара всяка година за тактики за потискане на федералния пожар, включително оборудване и персонал.<br/>Топ 10 на най-разрушителните пожари от финансови загуби са настъпили в Калифорния, като най-големият е лагерният огън от 2018 г., който е направил над 10,4 милиарда долара разходи за засегнатите. Горските пожари не са само финансово въздействащи, те могат да причинят големи щети на околната среда и да бъдат неудобство за общите човешки дейности.<br/>Разбира се, бушуващите пожари, които горят в района, означават, че е вероятно затварянето на пътищата, което се отразява на пътуванията. Освен това димът, генериран от горските пожари, може да има силно въздействие върху общностите дори на стотици километри, тъй като се носи в атмосферата. Това може да понижи пепелта и праховите частици и да повлияе на качеството на въздуха, което затруднява много хора да бъдат навън. Комуникацията може да бъде засегната, ако пожарите се доближат до телефонни линии, кули за мобилни телефони или дори центрове за разпределение на енергия.<br/>Можете да видите защо минимизирането на горските пожари би довело до намаляване на въздействията върху човешката дейност.<br/>Екологичните щети могат да бъдат значителни, тъй като горските пожари често изгарят големи участъци от земи, са с висока интензивност и имат тежки последици. През 2020 г. близо 60 000 пожара в САЩ, засягащи над 10 милиона акра на източното и западното крайбрежие. Обикновено повече пожари в източните щати, но тези пожари са по-малки по размер и като цяло са по-малко тежки. Западните държави виждат малко по-малко пожари от източните, но западните пожари могат да бъдат по-интензивни и да консумират повече площ наведнъж. Тази регионална разлика обикновено се вижда поради пейзажите, видовете растения и гориво, които са на разположение за изгаряне, както и разликите във времето, особено условията на засушаване. Горските пожари засягат растителните общности и дивата природа в района и като цяло оказват негативно влияние върху околната среда.<br/>Може да изглежда странно да се бориш с огъня с огън, но има "добри пожари" и "лоши пожари". Предписаното изгаряне е като рецепта, написана от лекар - "лекарят" в този случай е управителят на земята. Предписанието уточнява какви са целите на изгарянето, метеорологичните условия, когато изгарянето трябва да се провежда за най-добри резултати и най-малко човешко въздействие, както и интензивността на огъня, за да се постигнат резултатите.<br/>Тази рецепта означава, че пожарът ще се случи по безопасен, контролиран начин с малко въздействие върху околната среда или хората.<br/>Предписаният огън прави повече от просто предотвратяване на бушуващите горски пожари, той може да се възползва и от местните пейзажи, да подобри източниците на храна и местообитанието за дивата природа или да контролира подпората в дървените стойки. Много местни растения по света са предназначени за възникване на пожар, тъй като пожарите естествено биха се появили много преди човешката намеса. Някои растения се нуждаят от огън, за да се отворят семенните им шушулки, някои се нуждаят от други растения, за да бъдат изчистени чрез огън, така че семената им да покълнат и да успеят, докато други са проектирани да издържат на огън с дебела, изолираща кора или восъчна листа.<br/>Предписаните горелки могат да ви разкажат много истории за елени, пуйки, пъдпъдъци и други диви животни, идващи веднага след пожар, за да консумират растения и насекоми. Дивата природа също се възползва от подобреното хранене в растенията и по-добрите местообитания в районите, регенериращи се след пожар.<br/>Предписаният огън може да бъде полезен инструмент и за вашата земя. Протегнете се към местната горска служба или предписана асоциация за изгаряне, за да видите как предписаното изгаряне може да се приложи върху вашия имот.

| The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I – Book Review<br/>The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I: Battalion Histories Based on Official Documents. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 pages, photographs, maps. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>The Fourth Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, was one of the more famous combat units in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. Consisting of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion (Marine), the Fourth Brigade went through five main battles: Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont, and the closing days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.<br/>Clark, a former Marine and an author with many historical Marine Corps books to his credit, based this history largely upon official records. The book is not footnoted until Chapter 3, and then it is only sparsely footnoted. Thus, in most cases, we cannot know precisely where a given quote or information comes from. While we may assume that an operations report or field message is the origin of some data, there is nothing to tell us where we may find that information. Quotes, including entire block quotations, are left un-footnoted with no indication as to the origin of the material. Probably most of the information comes from the ten-volume Records of the Second Division, listed in the bibliography, which is grist for the Marine Corps enthusiast’s mill.<br/>The book is divided into eight chapters; the first chapter gives an overview of the Fourth Brigade’s history as a whole. Each of the rest of the chapters covers one of the battalions of the brigade, plus the brigade’s machine gun battalion. Each chapter is in turn arranged chronologically in a style reminiscent of a diary or log, with narrative falling under a given day or range of days. This arrangement makes for a disjointed overall history of the brigade; it is difficult to get the feel of how the battalions fit into the division’s role during a battle. The narrative falls into recording what seem like disjointed events without the benefit of broader context. Furthermore, the battalion/chapter arrangement ensures an amount of repetition because the same background must be repeated for each battalion, and each battle is “fought” seven times. There are many fine photographs included, and the maps are adequate, although I would prefer more maps with greater detail. Surprisingly, neither the photographs nor the maps are credited.<br/>With all that being said, it should be recognized that the author, an expert on this subject, has made an important effort to document the history of this brigade. The original sources, field messages in particular, capture the confusion and flavor of combat as experienced by the junior officers in the brigade. Historians interested in the Fourth Brigade are fortunate to have available an abundance of its field messages (or at least copies thereof). Readers who are not familiar with these messages will find those quoted in the book to be an enlightening window on the world of AEF combat.<br/>Likewise, there are some interesting tidbits to be gleaned from the extensive array of operations reports included. One example, which illustrated how the AEF learned “on the fly,” is a report written by Lt. Col. Frederick M. Wise, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, after fighting at Belleau Wood. Wise’s enumeration of twenty-three lessons learned is quoted in full and provides some interesting reading. What also comes through in these messages and reports is that, especially in the early battles, command and control issues plagued even the vaunted Marines. Platoons and companies became lost and diverged from their intended path as battalion commanders anxiously sought information via runners. It’s also interesting to see the degree of involvement at Belleau Wood by the brigade commander, Brigadier General James G. Harbord (US Army). Harbord wasn’t shy about sending messages directly to battalion and even company commanders, bypassing regimental commanders.<br/>Despite the issues and troubles, which were common to all units fighting in World War I, the 2nd Division succeeded in making an enviable record (although, it must be said, at a great cost in casualties). Most historians agree that it was one of the two best divisions in the AEF (the other being the First Division), and the Fourth Brigade did its part to earn that reputation. The success of the brigade can in part be attributed to the personal heroism of its officers and men. The author, probably using award citations or recommendations, has carefully recorded the heroic feats of individual Marines, soldiers, and Navy corpsmen; this is a valuable contribution to the history of the brigade and a fine tribute to brave men.<br/>This book will appeal to readers who are interested in the Marine Corps. For those who are not familiar with the 2nd Division, it might be helpful to first read a history of that division (for example, The Battery Press’s 1989 reprint of The Second Division, American Expeditionary Force in France, 1917-1919). That history, although a bit dry in places, will help put the action described in Clark’s book in context.<br/>Peter L. Belmonte is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and freelance historian. A veteran of Operation Desert Storm, he has written extensively on immigration and military history, and his current studies focus on the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. His most recent book, Days of Perfect Hell: The 26th U.S. Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, October-November, 1918, will be released by Schiffer Books in October. | Четвърта морска бригада през Първата световна война – Book Review<br/>Четвърта морска бригада през Първата световна война: История на батальона въз основа на официални документи. Джордж Б. Кларк. Макфарланд, 2015. 288 страници, снимки, карти. Меки. $ 39.95.<br/>Четвърта бригада, част от 2-ра дивизия, е една от най-известните бойни единици в американските експедиционни сили (AEF) през Голямата война. Състояща се от 5-ти и 6-ти пехотен полк и 6-ти картечен батальон (Марин), Четвърта бригада преминава през пет основни битки: Бело Ууд, Соасонс, Сен Михиел, Блан Монт и заключителните дни на офанзивата Мьоз-Аргон.<br/>Кларк, бивш морски пехотинец и автор с много исторически книги на морската пехота за негова чест, основава тази история до голяма степен на официални записи. Книгата не е под линия до Глава 3, а след това е само рядко под линия. По този начин, в повечето случаи, ние не можем да знаем точно къде даден цитат или информация идва от. Докато ние може да се предположи, че една операция доклад или поле съобщение е произходът на някои данни, няма нищо, което да ни каже къде можем да намерим тази информация. Цитатите, включително цели блокови котировки, са оставени неотбелязани без индикация за произхода на материала. Вероятно по-голямата част от информацията идва от десеттомните Записи на Втора дивизия, изброени в библиографията, която е жилава за мелницата на ентусиаста на морската пехота.<br/>Книгата е разделена на осем глави; първата глава прави преглед на историята на Четвърта бригада като цяло. Всяка от останалите глави обхваща един от батальоните на бригадата, плюс картечния батальон на бригадата. Всяка глава от своя страна е подредена хронологично в стил, напомнящ дневник или дневник, с разказ, попадащ под даден ден или диапазон от дни. Тази подредба прави разединена цялостната история на бригадата; трудно е да се добие усещането за това как батальоните се вписват в ролята на дивизията по време на битка. Разказът попада в запис на това, което изглежда като несвързани събития, без ползата от по-широк контекст. Освен това, подреждането на батальона/главата осигурява количество повторение, тъй като за всеки батальон трябва да се повтори един и същ фон, а всяка битка се "бори" седем пъти. Включени са много фини снимки, а картите са адекватни, въпреки че бих предпочел повече карти с по-големи подробности. Изненадващо, нито снимките, нито картите са кредитирани.<br/>Като се има предвид всичко това, трябва да се признае, че авторът, експерт по тази тема, е направил важно усилие да документира историята на тази бригада. Оригиналните източници, по-специално полевите съобщения, улавят объркването и вкуса на бойните действия, както са изпитани от младшите офицери в бригадата. Историците, интересуващи се от Четвърта бригада, имат късмет, че разполагат с изобилие от полевите си послания (или поне копия от тях). Читателите, които не са запознати с тези послания, ще намерят тези, цитирани в книгата, за поучителен прозорец към света на AEF борбата.<br/>По същия начин, има някои интересни неща, които трябва да бъдат събрани от обширния масив от доклади за операциите, включени. Един пример, който илюстрира как AEF научава "в движение", е доклад, написан от подполковник Фредерик М. Уайз, командир на 2-ри батальон, 5-и пехотен полк, след боеве при Бело Ууд. Цитирането на двадесет и три от научените уроци на Уайз е цитирано изцяло и предоставя някои интересни четива. Това, което също става в тези съобщения и доклади, е, че особено в ранните битки, въпросите за командването и контрола тормозят дори прехвалените морски пехотинци. Взводовете и ротите се губят и се отклоняват от предвидения им път, тъй като командирите на батальоните тревожно търсят информация чрез бегачи. Също така е интересно да се види степента на участие в Belleau Wood от командира на бригадата, бригаден генерал Джеймс Г. Харбърд (Американската армия). Харбърд не се срамувал да изпраща съобщения директно до батальонните и дори ротните командири, заобикаляйки полковите командири.<br/>Въпреки проблемите и неприятностите, които са общи за всички единици, сражаващи се в Първата световна война, 2-ра дивизия успява да направи завиден рекорд (въпреки че, трябва да се каже, с голяма цена на жертвите). Повечето историци са съгласни, че това е една от двете най-добри дивизии в AEF (другата е Първа дивизия), а Четвъртата бригада е направила своята част, за да спечели тази репутация. Успехът на бригадата може отчасти да се отдаде на личния героизъм на нейните офицери и мъже. Авторът, вероятно използвайки грамоти или препоръки, внимателно е записал героичните подвизи на отделни морски пехотинци, войници и военноморски корпуси; това е ценен принос към историята на бригадата и глоба почит към смелите мъже.<br/>Тази книга ще се хареса на читателите, които се интересуват от морската пехота. За тези, които не са запознати с 2-ра дивизия, може да е полезно първо да прочетат историята на тази дивизия (например, препечатката на The Battery Press от 1989 г. на Втора дивизия, Американски експедиционни сили във Франция, 1917-1919). Тази история, макар и малко суха на места, ще помогне да се постави действието, описано в книгата на Кларк в контекст.<br/>Питър Белмонте (на английски: Peter L. Belmonte) е пенсиониран офицер от Военновъздушните сили на САЩ и историк на свободна практика. Ветеран от операция Пустинна буря, той е писал обстойно за имиграцията и военната история, а настоящите му изследвания се фокусират върху американските експедиционни сили през Първата световна война. Най-новата му книга, Days of Perfect Hell: 26-ти пехотен полк на САЩ в Офанзивата Мьоз-Аргон, октомври-ноември 1918 г., ще бъде издадена от Schiffer Books през октомври. |
