| The workplace can be a complex environment, with numerous laws and regulations that govern the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers. In Canada, the legal framework that governs employment relationships is known as status law. Status law covers a wide range of issues, from hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety. Understanding these laws is critical for employees, who can use this information to protect their rights and advocate for themselves in the workplace. This guide will provide a brief overview of some of the most common law cases in Canada.<br/>Hiring and Termination:<br/>One of the most important aspects of status law is the hiring process. Employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws and ensure that they do not make hiring decisions based on factors such as race, gender, age, or religion. Once an employee has been hired, the employer is also required to follow specific procedures if they decide to terminate the employee. By Law includes providing the employee with adequate notice, or paying them severance if the termination is without cause. best employment lawyer Toronto can advise about it.<br/>Discrimination and Harassment:<br/>Another critical aspect of status law is protecting employees from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfairly based on a personal characteristic, such as race, gender, age, or religion. Harassment is any behavior that creates a hostile or offensive working environment. In both cases, employees have the right to file a complaint with their employer or with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.<br/>Wages and Hours of Work:<br/>Status law also regulates the wages and hours of work for employees. Employers must comply with minimum wage laws and ensure that employees receive the appropriate overtime pay for any hours worked over the standard workweek. In addition, employers must provide employees with breaks and time off for holidays, vacations, and sick leave.<br/>Finally, status law requires employers to maintain a safe working environment for their employees. This includes providing adequate training, equipment, and safety protocols to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. Employees have the right to refuse work if they believe it is unsafe, and employers must investigate and address any safety concerns raised by employees and represented by the best employment lawyer in Toronto.<br/>In conclusion, understanding the common cases in Canadian status law is essential for employees to navigate the workplace and protect their rights. From hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety, employees need to be aware of the laws that govern their employment relationship. If employees have any questions or concerns, they can seek advice from a lawyer or consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. By knowing their rights and responsibilities, employees can ensure a fair and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues. | Радно место може бити сложено окружење, са бројним законима и прописима који регулишу права и одговорности запослених и послодаваца. У Канади, правни оквир који регулише радне односе познат је као статусни закон. Закон о статусу покрива широк спектар питања, од запошљавања и раскида до дискриминације и безбедности на радном месту. Разумевање ових закона је критично за запослене, који могу да користе ове информације да заштите своја права и заговарају за себе на радном месту. Овај водич ће пружити кратак преглед неких од најчешћих правних случајева у Канади.<br/>Запошљавање и завршавање:<br/>Један од најважнијих аспеката закона о статусу је процес запошљавања. Послодавци се морају придржавати антидискриминационих закона и осигурати да не доносе одлуке о запошљавању на основу фактора као што су раса, пол, старост или религија. Када је запослени ангажован, послодавац је такође дужан да прати одређене процедуре ако одлучи да отпусти запосленог. Законом се запосленом обезбеђује адекватно обавештење или им се исплаћује отпуштање ако је отпуштање без разлога. Најбољи адвокат за запошљавање Торонто може саветовати о томе.<br/>Дискриминација и узнемиравање:<br/>Још један критични аспект статусног закона је заштита запослених од дискриминације и узнемиравања на радном месту. Дискриминација се јавља када се запослени третира неправедно на основу личних карактеристика, као што су раса, пол, старост или религија. Узнемиравање је свако понашање које ствара непријатељско или увредљиво радно окружење. У оба случаја, запослени имају право да поднесу жалбу свом послодавцу или Канадској комисији за људска права.<br/>Плате и радно време:<br/>Закон о статусу такође регулише плате и сате рада за запослене. Послодавци морају да се придржавају закона о минималној заради и осигуравају да запослени примају одговарајућу прековремену плату за било који сат који је радио током стандардне радне недеље. Поред тога, послодавци морају запосленима пружити паузе и одмор за одмор, одмор и боловање.<br/>Коначно, статусни закон захтева од послодаваца да одржавају сигурно радно окружење за своје запослене. Ово укључује пружање одговарајуће обуке, опреме и сигурносних протокола за спречавање несрећа и повреда на радном месту. Запослени имају право да одбију рад ако верују да је то опасно, а послодавци морају истражити и ријешити све безбедносне проблеме које су поставили запослени и које представља најбољи адвокат за запошљавање у Торонту.<br/>У закључку, разумевање уобичајених случајева у канадском закону о статусу је од суштинског значаја за запослене да се крећу на радном месту и штите своја права. Од запошљавања и раскида до дискриминације и безбедности на радном месту, запослени морају бити свесни закона који регулишу њихов радни однос. Ако запослени имају било каквих питања или забринутости, они могу тражити савет од адвоката или се консултовати са Канадском комисијом за људска права. Знајући своја права и одговорности, запослени могу осигурати фер и сигурно радно окружење за себе и своје колеге. |
| There's an old adage in the auto industry that says your vehicle loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot. The computer and technology industry is not so different, in that new parts and systems are constantly pushing the envelope of performance and value, making it impossible to have a top-of-the-line system for very long. The purpose of this paper is to step back in time 10 years and examine the technology landscape then to see how it compares to today's technologies we know and love.<br/>Much has been written, and much is still debated about the technology axiom called; Moore's Law. Some people interpret the law to mean a doubling of computer power every 18 months to 2 years, while others maintain it means a doubling of the numbers of transistors (microscopic on / off switches if you will) engineers are able to print into the same amount of silicon. In fact Moore stated that transistor counts would double every year, which he later adjusted to be every 2 years) Regardless, this trend of performance and transistor growth has held true for over 40 years.<br/>More recently, Moore's law has been applied to graphics processing units (GPUs) as well. The GPU is actually not even 10 years old at the time of writing. The official term GPU was coined with the nVidia GeForce 256 series of 3D cards. Released in August 1999, this was the first chip that was able to compute vertex transformations and pixel lighting in hardware. Since its release, graphics processing power has followed a similar trend of doubling performance every 18 months to 2 years. This article is not a technical document, rather a glimpse into the past 10 years ago to give you an idea of how far we've come in such a short time.<br/>A Little History About the Author:<br/>The year was 1999. It was my sophomore / junior year in high school. Now I'll pause so that 90% of the readers who grow up in the 70s and 80's can turn up their nose and stop reading.<br/>Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's continue.<br/>I am an internet child. I got into computers, and all manner of electronic geekery just as the Internet was becoming something that "just might catch on". My high school was not quite on the boring edge of technology as it was, but we were one of the first public schools in my area to be equipped with a full T1 line and the 1.5Mbps of awesome dedicated bandwidth that it piped through the network . Our network was built from a hodge-podge mixture of nice PC computers labs (mostly K6 200MHz / Win 95 machines), and a network engineers nightmare concoction of Macintoshes; LC II's up through new G3 iMacs.<br/>In 1999 I was still rocking a 486 DX-33 PC with 8MB of ram and Windows 3.11 as my PC at home, while my parents had a nice Pentium 100 Windows 95 machine my siblings and I would fight for time on. So what was the point of those last couple paragraphs you're probably asking? Well, that is where I was, and what I was using 10 years ago in computing, and hopefully it got you thinking back a decade to what you were computing on.<br/>10 years ago today, The computer world was working itself into a frenzy, getting ready for the near future release of the brand new Intel Pentium III Processor. The best money could do was a Pentium II processor at 450MHz with PC100 Memory. Rival AMD was doing alright for itself peddling its budget conscious K6-2 series of processors. Your average computer cost around $ 2000- $ 2500 at this time for a PC with a solid Pentium II processor. The Pentium III was due to be released on February 26th, and was the subject of a wicked debate over the merits of its built in unique ID number. Also noteworthy was its inclusion of the first SSE instruction set (The modern Core i7 processor is at SSE4 +). However without software designed to make use of the new instructions the processor was not much faster than an equivalent clocked Pentium II CPU and took quite a bit of heat from the press.<br/>On the graphics front the war between nVidia and 3DFx was raging. nVidia, a relative newcomer to the field, was riding high on top of their very successful TNT (Twin-Texel) video processor, while 3DFx was fighting to retain its market leadership title with its Voodoo3 line of graphics cards. The Voodoo cards were excellent performers, however the TNT cards had the advantage of 32 bit color while the Voodoo's were stuck at 24 bits. ATI was around and kicking with their Rage series of 3D cards (especially popular as integrated chips in servers and workstations), however they never really entered into the hardcore 3D accelerator race until the Radeon line debuted in 2000.<br/>In 1999 the internet boom was just beginning and attracting massive amounts of attention and investment capital from all over the globe. The big business of the time was in the search and portal business. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and Lycos were perhaps the most recognizable and capable players in this industry. Google -say-wha? Other companies from other industries, such as television media, and ISPs were taking notice, and buying up internet portals right and left in an attempt to tap into the viral spread of the internet. New technologies like Java were coming into their own, and began to lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. Studies determined that by 1999 about half of US households had a computer, and most of the new computer purchases were being made to get online.<br/>PDA's were quickly becoming the new must have gadget. The Palm Pilot being the device that led the charge. I myself had a Palm IIIe toward the later half of 2000. Personal pagers were still hot sellers, but cell phones were getting smaller and more practical and affordable. Also a war was heating up in the computer memory segment. Samsung introduced new DDR memory chips that promised to double the effective bandwidth of existing memory chips in future setups, however Rambus was busy developing their own high speed RAM for use in high end Intel systems.<br/>This field is possibly a bit too large to cover here, but a brief OS recap: The PC world was running strong with windows 98, and anxiously awaiting the updated Windows 98 Second Edition due out in May 1999. The Macintosh crowd was plugging away happily on their Mac OS 8.5 Machines, while awaiting an update to OS 9 sometime later that year. Linux was also starting to come into its own, as big name vendors like IBM were starting to bundle distributions of Redhat, Caldera, and others with some servers.<br/>I'll admit this article was more for my amusement and reminiscing than anything else. I hope that somewhere in the course of this mass of words and broken sentences, you too had some good recollections of computer equipment past. It's good to remember the technologies we grow up with and we are fortunately enough to have the robust internet we are used to today to help conjure up images and technical specs of those glory days. Sites like the Tech Time Machine exist to help us relive those days, and have a few chuckles at equipment we thought we'd never use to its full potential. I remember touching a Pentium 200MMX machine for the first time and being in awe at its raw speed and seemingly infinite possibilities. Now I constantly get upset with the speed of my current 3GHz dual core Athlon X2 6000+ PC. I can not even imagine how many windows that Pentium 200 would have thrown out of today. It's a crazy world we live in. | Постоји стара изрека у аутомобилској индустрији која каже да ваше возило губи вредност чим га возите. Рачунарска и технолошка индустрија није толико различита, у томе што нови делови и системи стално гурају коверту перформанси и вредности, чинећи немогућим да имају врхунски систем веома дуго. Сврха овог рада је да се вратимо 10 година уназад и испитамо технолошки пејзаж, а затим да видимо како се он упоређује са данашњим технологијама које познајемо и волимо.<br/>Много је написано, а много се још увек расправља о технолошком аксиому која се зове Муров закон. Неки људи тумаче закон да значи удвостручавање снаге рачунара сваких 18 месеци до 2 године, док други сматрају да то значи удвостручавање броја транзистора (микроскопских прекидача ако желите) инжењери су у стању да штампају у исту количину силицијума. У ствари, Мур је изјавио да ће се број транзистора удвостручити сваке године, што је касније прилагодио да буде сваке 2 године) Без обзира на то, овај тренд перформанси и раста транзистора важи већ више од 40 година.<br/>У скорије време, Моореов закон је примењен и на графичке процесорске јединице (ГПУ). ГПУ заправо није ни КСНУМКС година у време писања. Званични термин ГПУ је скован са нВидиа ГеФорце КСНУМКС серијом КСНУМКСД картица. Објављен у августу 1999, ово је био први чип који је био у стању да израчуна вертек трансформације и пиксела осветљење у хардверу. Од свог ослобађања, графичка процесорска снага је пратио сличан тренд удвостручавања перформанси сваких 18 месеци до 2 године. Овај чланак није технички документ, већ поглед на последњих 10 година како би вам дао идеју о томе колико смо далеко дошли у тако кратком времену.<br/>Мало историје о аутору:<br/>Година је била 1999. Била је то моја друга / јуниорска година у средњој школи. Сада ћу паузирати тако да 90% читалаца који одрастају у 70-им и 80-им годинама могу да подигну нос и престану да читају.<br/>Ок, сада када је то ван пута, хајде да наставимо.<br/>Ја сам дете интернета. Ушао сам у рачунаре, и све врсте електронских геекерија баш као што је интернет постао нешто што би "могло да се ухвати". Моја средња школа није била баш на досадној ивици технологије као што је била, али смо били једна од првих јавних школа у мом подручју која је била опремљена пуном Т1 линијом и КСНУМКСМбпс страшним посвећеним пропусним опсегом који је пролазио кроз мрежу . Наша мрежа је изграђена од мешавине Ходге-подге лепих ПЦ рачунара лабораторија (углавном ККСНУМКС КСНУМКСМХз / Вин КСНУМКС машине), и мрежни инжењери ноћна мора измишљотина Мацинтосхес; ЛЦ ИИ је кроз нове ГКСНУМКС иМацс.<br/>У 1999 сам још увек љуљање 486 ДКС-33 ПЦ са 8МБ РАМ-а и Виндовс 3.11 као мој рачунар код куће, док су моји родитељи имали леп Пентиум 100 Виндовс 95 машина моја браћа и сестре и ја бих се борити за време на. Дакле, која је била сврха тих последњих пар параграфа које вероватно питате? Па, то је где сам био, и оно што сам користио пре 10 година у рачунарству, и надам се да вас је навело да размишљате деценију уназад на оно на чему сте рачунали.<br/>Пре 10 година данас, Рачунарски свет је радио сам у лудило, припремајући се за блиској будућности издање потпуно новог Интел Пентиум ИИИ процесора. Најбољи новац могао да уради је Пентиум ИИ процесор на 450МХз са ПЦ100 меморије. Ривал АМД је добро за себе продавао своју буџетску свјесну ККСНУМКС-КСНУМКС серију процесора. Ваш просечни рачунар кошта око $ КСНУМКС- $ КСНУМКС у овом тренутку за ПЦ са чврстим Пентиум ИИ процесором. Пентиум ИИИ је требало да буде објављен 26. фебруара, и био је предмет зле дебате о заслугама свог изграђеног јединственог ИД броја. Такође је вредно напоменути његово укључивање првог ССЕ скупа инструкција (Модерни Цоре иКСНУМКС процесор је на ССЕКСНУМКС +). Међутим, без софтвера дизајнираног да користи нова упутства, процесор није био много бржи од еквивалентног Пентиум ИИ процесора и узимао је доста топлоте из штампе.<br/>На графичком фронту, рат између nVidia и 3DFx је беснео. нВидиа, релативни новајлија на терену, возио је високо на врху свог веома успешног ТНТ (Твин-Текел) видео процесора, док се 3ДФк борио да задржи своју титулу лидера на тржишту са својом Воодоо3 линијом графичких картица. Вуду картице су биле одлични извођачи, међутим ТНТ картице су имале предност 32-битне боје док су Вуду картице биле заглављене на 24 бита. АТИ је био око и ударао са својом серијом Раге 3Д картица (посебно популаран као интегрисани чипови на серверима и радним станицама), међутим, никада нису ушли у хардцоре 3Д акцелераторску трку све док Радеон линија није дебитовала 2000. године.<br/>У КСНУМКС-у је интернет бум тек почео и привлачио огромне количине пажње и инвестиционог капитала из целог света. Велики посао тог времена био је у послу претраге и портала. Иахоо, АлтаВиста, Екците, и Лицос су можда најпрепознатљивији и способни играчи у овој индустрији. Гоогле -саи-вха? Друге компаније из других индустрија, као што су телевизијски медији и интернет провајдери, примећују и купују интернет портале десно и лево у покушају да се укључе у вирусно ширење интернета. Нове технологије попут Јаве су долазиле у своје, и почеле су да постављају темеље за интернет какав данас познајемо. Студије су утврдиле да је до 1999. године око половине америчких домаћинстава имало рачунар, а већина нових куповина рачунара била је направљена да би се добила на мрежи.<br/>ПДА су брзо постали нови мора имати гаџет. Палм Пилот је уређај који је водио пуњење. Ја сам имао Палм ИИИе према другој половини КСНУМКС-а. Лични пејџери су и даље били врући продавци, али мобилни телефони су постајали мањи и практичнији и приступачнији. Такође, рат се загрејао у сегменту меморије рачунара. Самсунг је представио нове ДДР меморијске чипове који су обећали да ће удвостручити ефикасни пропусни опсег постојећих меморијских чипова у будућим конфигурацијама, међутим Рамбус је био заузет развојем сопствене велике брзине РАМ-а за употребу у хигх-енд Интел системима.<br/>Ово поље је можда мало превелико да би се покрило овде, али кратак ОС сажетак: ПЦ свет је трчао снажно са Виндовс 98, и са нестрпљењем очекује ажурирано Виндовс 98 Сецонд Едитион који треба да изађе у мају 1999. године. Мацинтосхова гомила се срећно прикључила на своје Мац ОС 8.5 машине, док је чекала ажурирање на ОС 9 негде касније те године. Линукс је такође почео да долази у своје, јер су велики произвођачи као што је ИБМ почели да спајају дистрибуције Редхата, Калдере и других са неким серверима.<br/>Признајем да је овај чланак био више за моју забаву и сећање него било шта друго. Надам се да негде у току ове масе речи и сломљених реченица, и ви сте имали неке добре успомене на рачунарску опрему прошлости. Добро је запамтити технологије са којима одрастамо и довољно смо срећни да имамо робустан интернет на који смо данас навикли да помогнемо да се привуку слике и техничке спецификације тих славних дана. Сајтови као што је Тецх Тиме Мацхине постоје да би нам помогли да оживимо те дане, и имамо неколико насмејаних на опрему за коју смо мислили да никада нећемо искористити свој пуни потенцијал. Сећам се да сам први пут додирнуо Пентиум КСНУМКСММКС машину и био у страхопоштовању због своје сирове брзине и наизглед бесконачних могућности. Сада се стално узнемиравам брзином мог тренутног КСНУМКСГХз двојног језгра Атхлон КсКСНУМКС КСНУМКС + ПЦ. Не могу ни да замислим колико прозора би Пентиум КСНУМКС избацио из данас. То је луди свет у којем живимо. |
| The cultural anthropology major and minor offer a holistic understanding of human diversity. By exploring, analyzing, and understanding patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors, shared histories, language, visual representations and material realities, cultural anthropology focuses on what it means to be human. Our courses address relevant concerns such as food and nutrition; urban, rural, and global adaptive strategies; environmental sustainability; and economic development. Through its comparative and engaged field research methods, cultural anthropology recognizes culture as the primary means by which humans engage in social and environmental interactions to define meaningful and purposeful lives. Cultural anthropology complements well all other undergraduate majors.<br/>Top 3 Skills Learned<br/>- Critical thinking<br/>- Qualitative research methods<br/>- Partnership & collaboration with community<br/>Usually this happens toward the end of the Introduction to Anthropology course, when you realize that anthropology opens doors to new ways of looking at relevant problems in our world.

| Fact or Myth: Sodium Raises Blood Pressure<br/>Well, Matt, it turns out a high sodium diet might not raise blood pressure, nor have any sort of adverse effect on cardiovascular health at all. But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence (and there is more evidence that says it doesn’t than does).<br/>The debate over eating too much salt has been around since the 1960s. Almost every major governmental health organization embraces the idea that eating too much salt is damaging to your health. Most major news outlets report on these recommendations and people tend to try and follow them. This is most likely why most of us, especially the elderly with heart problems, know to reduce the amount of salt we eat. Those of us who like the idea that any recommendation be backed up by solid evidence, have to step back on this one. As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.<br/>So why have most health organizations pushed the idea of low sodium diets? The theory behind their supposition is sound, and there are some studies that show a minor risk of elevated blood pressure with extremely high salt intake. Unfortunately, there are many other studies that show no increase, and still some that show reducing salt intake might actually raise your blood pressure! Let’s look at the controversy in more detail.<br/>The idea salt will increase your blood pressure has to do with osmotic pressure. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell walls), from areas of lower solute concentration (in this case salt) to areas of higher solute concentration. This naturally equalizes the solute concentration on both sides of the membrane. (This osmotic pressure is also why salt can be used to preserves meat.)<br/>So the theory goes that when we eat too much salt, our bloodstream has more sodium in it than the surrounding areas of our body. This causes the water in those areas to be pulled into our bloodstream. The increase in water within the arteries and veins causes an increase in the pressure within those arteries and veins. The salt itself also acts like an irritant within the arteries causing them to constrict. This too is thought to increase your blood pressure.<br/>The theory seems, on the surface, very sound. After all, we can make the process of salt pulling water through membranes happen time and time again in the lab. The question is, does this actually happen within our bodies, and does this actually cause long term hypertension (high blood pressure)?<br/>In 1969, Lewis Dahl testified before Sen. George McGovern’s “select committee on nutrition and human needs”. He was concerned about the high concentrations of sodium in baby foods and thought this might cause increase in people’s blood pressure long term. His reasoning was that studies done on rats showed increases in the blood pressure of the rats.<br/>The conversation about salt and hypertension began to circulate among health organizations. The National Institutes of Health, in 1972, began introducing “High Blood Pressure Education Programs”. As their evidence, they pointed out observationally, populations who ate very little sodium had low incidents of high blood pressure. They also pointed to the rat modeling. Scientists at the time questioned this, as the rat studies had them eating 60 times what the average person does. They also pointed out the populations who ate low sodium diets, also ate low amounts of other things, like sugar (which also affects osmosis).<br/>Despite their objections, publicly, the idea of high sodium diets causing high blood pressure was here to stay, and remains today. The Centers For Disease Control, The National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and many other organizations currently promote low sodium diets.<br/>Despite the seemingly unified front presented by these distinguished organizations, the controversy among scientists is extremely heated. In 1998, award winning author Taubes, published “The Political Science of Salt” in the Journal of Science. He stated, “The controversy over the benefits, if any, of salt reduction now constitutes one of the longest running most vitriolic and surreal disputes in all of medicine.”<br/>One surgeon general in a report wrote, the speed with which US federal agencies embraced sodium reduction, “stood in stark contrast to how long it had taken for recommendations to emerge on the importance of reducing blood cholesterol levels”. He also noted that the difference was even more remarkable considering the absence of published research that actually tested the theory. On the flip-side, Sir Micheal Rawlings, the chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, who promotes salt reduction diets argued that, “Guidance (in policy making) is based on the best available evidence. The evidence may not, however, be very good and is rarely complete.” Not a very strong argument for reducing salt intake.<br/>Let’s look at a few relatively recent studies. In 2008, Italian researchers began publishing the results from a series of clinical trials, all of which reported that, among patients with heart failure, reducing salt consumption increased the risk of death. These studies were followed by others which showed among Type 1 and 2 diabetics, healthy Europeans and patients with chronic heart failure, those that ate salt at the lower limit of the normal range were more likely to have heart disease than those who ate salt in the middle range of normal.<br/>In 2011, two Cochrane reviews found no evidence that low salt diets either improved or worsened peoples’ health. They stated, “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.”<br/>Even in the face of no clear scientific evidence to support it and some to the contrary, in 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Society of Hypertension all continued to promote low sodium diets as a means of controlling high blood pressure.<br/>In the end, being a medical professional and someone who needs clear evidence to make a decision about whether I get to add copious amounts of salt on my fries, I am pleased to find that so far there is very little! All the major health organizations seem to promote low sodium diets, but none have actually published consistent studies that show low sodium diets help in health, particularly not in cardiovascular health. What I find most annoying, a pet peeve of mine, is that none of these organizations tell people that the science behind their policies is controversial and they might be flat wrong. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns, and Sandro Galea said it best in their article “Salt And Public Health”- “After a careful consideration of the debate over salt, we have concluded that the concealment of scientific uncertainty is a mistake that serves neither the ends of science nor good policy.”<br/>So you should you go out and smother everything in salt now? As with most things, if science hasn’t been able to answer the question definitively one way or the other, and you want to be safe rather than sorry, just go with the age old rule of “moderation in everything”. If you, like me, like to salt everything like the rim of a margarita glass and moderation be damned, at least now you can feel a little better about it as science seems to be leaning more and more towards low sodium diets being unnecessary and high sodium ones not being harmful at all.<br/>If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below, you might also like:<br/>- Why Salt Enhances Flavor<br/>- What Do the Numbers in a Blood Pressure Test Mean and What Do They Tell the Doctor<br/>- What Causes Arms, Legs, and Feet to “Fall Asleep”<br/>- Top 5 First Aid Tricks Everyone Should Know<br/>- How to Remove a Fresh Carpet Stain with Nothing But Salt<br/>- High blood pressure is neither a disease nor an illness in and of itself. It’s merely a risk factor for other problems. For instance, if you have chronic high blood pressure, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke goes up significantly. This high pressure could be caused by excessive plaque on the inside of your artery walls, making those arteries in effect, smaller. Think plumbing. When the pipes that transport fluid get smaller, the pressure that same volume of fluid exerts goes up. What happens if your blood pressure gets too high? I’ll answer that question with another one. What happens if the water pressure in your houses pipes gets too high? Your pipes burst. Same thing here. Should your blood pressure get too high, your arteries have a greater chance of bursting. If there is too much gunk inside your pipes (plaque inside your arteries), that ball of gunk could get too big and clog off your pipes! Seems bad too me! Especially, if those arteries are in your brain, or heart. It’s not like kidneys, where you have two! You spring a leak in those organs, and your family finally gets that big paycheck from your life insurance policy! Not really the best way to get paid, well, unless you’re really a jerk and everyone in your family hates you! Then they might not mind so much, but you certainly would.<br/>- Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury. For reference, 1 psi (pounds per square inch) is equal to 51.7149326 millimeters of mercury. If you were bleeding and wanted to stop the blood-loss with direct pressure, and you should, you would only need to use about 3 psi to stop it. Unless they have really high blood pressure, then maybe 4 psi. Basic math saves the day again!<br/>- The first known experiment to measure the exact pressure of blood was performed by Stephen Hales on December 1, 1733. He took a live horse. Attached a tube to her left crural artery, then allowed her blood to rush through the tube and it rose to a height of 8’3”. He noted that “when it was at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each pulse 2, 3,or 4 inches”. Yes the horse bled out, but don’t think Mr. Hales was too cruel, he performed the experiment on a horse that was about to be put down anyway! To the horse, I’m sure this distinction didn’t matter much of course. 🙂<br/>*Legal Disclaimer: While I am a medical professional, this article contains general information about medical conditions and treatments.

There, I’ve covered myself.Expand for References<br/>&#124;Share the Knowledge!&#124;<br/>I’m getting more and more convinced that salt does significantly increase my BP. Whenever I eat crisps (chips if you live in the USA) which have a fairly large amount of salt, my BP goes up significantly the next few days.<br/>I tried getting saltless crisps about a week ago and added my own “lo-salt” (a salt substitute consisting of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (salt), but twice as much as the former than the latter).<br/>Anyway the lo-salt flavoured crisps (chips) diodn’t raise my BP at all.<br/>OK I know that further experiments on myself is required. But at the moment I’m strongly suspecting salt as the culprit. I’m also suspect that sugar increases my BP too. But lots of investigation required to establish that!<br/>Maybe you have a poor potassium to sodium balance. My mum has hypertension and was on a low sodium diet but she was not getting enough potassium and her blood pressure was not stable. If you are concerned you may want to have your blood potassium level checked.<br/>Now that she is consuming enough potassium she her blood pressure has been normal for over a year while consuming sodium within normal ranges(more than 2500 mg)<br/>It’s not the sodium…. it’s the fat and starch that is making you fatter and fatter; and that, is you body mass increasing and making it harder for your heart to pump blood through the veins and arteries that get squished in your body by the increased amount of accumulated fat.<br/>you are eating pure bloody starch and pointing to salt instead of the sugar, anything to avoid incrimination of sugar not too mention vegetable oil that increases all causes of death. You get far more osmolality from the sugar<br/>Hard evidence needed? Not a myth and very easy to document — requires little intelligence or training, anyone can do it. At the age of 52-54, this was over a two year period (2005 and 2006). Used a software program (Diet Power 4 — I paid $50 for it but it is now free to download) to track food, sodium, and bicycle exercise time. Produced graphs using the pen and paper method although will do the same thing being the program had no provisions to enter data on blood pressure. A doctor taking a reading every three to six months is absolutely is of no value in my opinion if an effort is not made to take the reading under identical circumstances other than to show a general trend over several years.<br/>I found that to be of any value, for my graph type and hypothesis (now proven), it was necessary to take several readings over a period of at least five minutes or until two close (three or less numerical spread and no more than three bpm on heart rate) readings. I would take note of readings after a two mile walk or an hour of biking at a slow to moderate rate. Wide swings over five minutes quit after I got in physical shape and stayed on the diet. Professional sites recommend sitting down 3 minutes or more and taking more than one reading but I only had one or two doctors in the last twenty years doing that, some over the need to quickly see another patient. A nurse claimed the significant reason for taking blood pressure readings were the insurance companies insisting on it. She claimed some doctors did not look at the readings she took so who cares if an effort was made to get an accurate reading was her conclusion.<br/>Walk in after rushing to show up on time, climbing stairs or whatever, sit down, a nurse grabs your arm and takes your blood pressure. At one time I convinced a doctor to take a second reading after ten minutes of discussing with me my medical problems. He claimed he had seldom waited, a man with 15 years of experience although professional sites recommended waiting three minutes. Another doctor claimed he had never heard of Na effecting blood pressure (he had been an army doctor with different standards for education he claimed).<br/>Now to the results. The graphs were beautiful and showed a perfect coalition between the the five factors entered; food type, sodium amounts, exercise, heart rate, weight.<br/>I had been on blood pressure medicine for ten years with only a numerical change of 5. I also was in sedentary employment and received zero exercise. My weight was at the upper end of normal weight or slightly overweight. I would would eat typical amounts of sodium for Americans (2,000+ mg) over two days. Then various amounts of low sodium for 4 days then gradually increase over a period of several days. After 72+ hours of a low sodium diet and exercise program, my blood pressure would drop significantly. 135/90 to 110/70 over three days was typical after being on my diet plan (the DASH diet) for one month. Sugar levels and high chemical foods were also recorded as part of diet. Sodium intake showed up more than others exercise as the biggest variable. High chemical foods also showed a difference although high chemical foods often have high sodium levels.<br/>Over four day after resuming the DASH diet there would be a significant and gradual change to the upside. It takes two or more days, depending on physical activity and water consumption to dissipate the sodium in your blood is my hypothesis although I have never confirmed this from research.<br/>I suspect sodium levels for proper blood pressure varies between people and different body designs (gender, race, activity, fat vs skinny, exercise level, etc). Many people may have little if any effect from a 2,000 mg vs 600 mg of Na. I’m not one of those. It is estimated cavemen had a diet of 400 to 600mg Na. What was good enough for cavemen (who had short lives for other reasons) was good enough for me.<br/>I had to make an effort to stay at 600 mg because of my diet. The diet I was on was 200 to 400 mg if I did not force myself to use that salt shaker). Sodium is a necessary part of your diet. I found Na amounts over 1000 mg were too much for my body. I have hypertension and heart palpitations with shortness of breath. My thyroid lab readings became perfect and the doctor took me off thyroid medication and blood pressure medication. My heart palliation’s and shortness of breath at 3 to 5 a.m. every night quit after one month. All my problems resumed significantly when I got off my diet plan/exercise in recent years. Of interest one older doctor who had been in the profession for forty years claimed I was only one of two people that went from a TSH level of 0.0 to 4.0 (the upper range of normal) after quitting the medication. Thyroid problems have resumed along with blood pressure, heart and heart palliation’s. I have now resumed the diet and exercise plan and tracking. I’ll send in an update after three months.<br/>I’m only one person, so put 400 people on the same program I’ve been on and see what happens. Problem of course is finding 200 honest people out of that 400 that do not fib on the diet and exercise database or guess. It also takes will power to stick to a program. I stuck with it for ten years then quit for miscellaneous reasons. Remove the ones from the database that show no improvement who refuse to swear under oath and take a lie detector test!<br/>Salt (Sodium) DOES raise your blood pressure. I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 130/90. She told me to control my salt (sodium 1500mg limit) and I had a check up two days later with my blood pressure 108/87. Anytime I eat lots of salty foods, I get a spike in my pressure. I am definitely salt sensitive.<br/>SALT (SODIUM) DOES affect your blood pressure. You have to be careful (it sneaks up on you good) and adjust your diet to limit sodium intake and watch for signs of your pressure raising. Especially when your body behavior changes.<br/>Work out as well! If you are lazy or not that active, take 30 minute walks 5 days a week (150 minutes total) minimum to get a decent exercise.<br/>I think the point is that recommending a lower sodium diet, that maybe affects a specific set of people, those who already have hypertension and are salt sensitive, to an entire population is ridiculous. Another point is whether high salt intake leads to chronic cardiovascular problems, which is being touted as fact to the public but has no research to back it up. I consume way more sodium than the CDC recommends and my BP has never been higher than 117/70, my highest ever, normal about 100-110/65-70. Neither of our cases prove one way or the other the effects “high” sodium intake has on the general population.<br/>You may have low cellular potassium, high copper, low vitamin k2, low magnesium, low vitamin E, heavy metal toxicity such as lead, everyone is exposed to lead and fluoride, these things compound each other.<br/>Look at conditions that cause you to have this salt sensitivity such as low potassium high cortisol.<br/>Don’t just rest on salt because you likely will have multiple issues as well almost no-one just eats salt by itself.<br/>Salt is generally found in high simple sugar no fiber foods with additives.<br/>Understand guidelines are for the whole population not just for you, this is problematic because unrefined salt is not shown to be unhealthy for most people and to some it improves health and in making these guidelines with no recognition of biochemical individuality.<br/>Understand lowering HBP is not the be all and end all, this has been mechanically done by drugs in studies which show no improvement in outcomes and even worsening of symptoms outside of the sign of BP measurement.<br/>Things to consider, Olive leaf extract, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin k2, potassium, curcumin, stevia(the natural sweetener), magnesium, pomegranite, l-arginine, nattokinase, fish oil, cocoa, beetroot, alpha lipoic acid, bromelain, flax seed, celery, coq10, flax seed, hawthorne. All these improve BP and cardiovascular issues. You have a lot more in your toolkit than you think<br/>As for Sugar, women should limit their sugar (Total Carbs is what matters and watch out for certain sugar alcohols) 20g-30g a snack and 30g-45g each meal. Men should keep their snack the same as women 20g-30g a snack and 60g – 75g a meal. The lowest numbers are the lmit for diabetics of course.<br/>I believe that some people have a sensitivity to sodium. I’m convinced that I do. After being on 3 different BP meds at one time and still having uncontrolled hypertension, I started reading food labels and drastically reducing my sodium intake. Most processed foods are loaded with sodium. I have been able to stop 2 meds completely and reduce the third one to 1/4 the prescribed dosage. For me, reducing sodium has made a huge difference. Last night I took 10 mg of lisinopril, which is 1/4 of the prescribed daily dosage. Today my BP is too low, 105/48. I really have to consistently monitor it, as low BP isn’t much fun, either.<br/>Blood pressure drugs are ineffective, they fail to improve outcomes only the BP reading.<br/>You have reduced your intake of low potassium high salt high sugar low fiber junk foods, this was always going to lower your blood pressure.<br/>Salt is not the enemy you just require potassium and antioxidants to balance it out and lower stress.<br/>When people reduce sodium in this way you cant contribute it to salt itself, you have completely altered your dietary intake of many things, this is how people can be fooled into thinking its a single thing.<br/>This attribution of a singular cause to problems is constantly done in hypothesis and they tend to be completely bogus demonizing singular things like Co2, salt, saturated fat, cholesterol, lack of seratonin, even lack of the poison fluorides use.<br/>These are all myths that fail under scrutiny but continue to be upheld as causes by regulating bodies by cherry picking and dismissal of minimization of overwhelming contradictions. The pharmaceutical junk food and vegetable oil corporations benefit and misinform the public for profit to which the FDA racketeers for them killing off their competition.<br/>Medicine research and much of other research is a cesspool of incestuous deception between private interest and boosting the economy as well as politicians doctors and government profit.<br/>The editors of the journals studies are published in find most studies to be entirely lacking, conclusions to be spun towards confirmation bias and that we are in quite a dark age for science where belief, consensus and peer review are less about good science and more about blackballing competing belief and evidence that will damage profits and future grants.<br/>Yea, whatever. Believe what you want. I have been reading health books for years….DECADES…and I’ve have read in them EXACTLY what is printed in this article. There NEVER has been a proven link between salt and high blood pressure. Furthermore, in one of books it pointed out that salt is used to make stomach acid, and it’s ironic that as we age, the low sodium diet so often touted leads to digestive problems.<br/>Keep believing doctors who take 3 credits of Nutrition in college and pitch compounds that cause worse side effects than the actual disease.<br/>Doctors, who say Chiropractic is “not real medicine.” Read the Winsdor papers. A doctor who set out to prove Chiro was fake by doing autopsies found that 99 out of 100 organ failures were due to lack of nerve energy caused by “subluxations” which pinch the nerves and interrupt nerve energy flow. (I’m not a chiropractor).<br/>Go read books by Norman Walker, (especially “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.”), TC Fry, and Herbert M. Shelton (Superior Nutrition, Fasting can save your life). I’ve read them all.<br/>BOTTOM LINE this is an excellent article and I’m actually surprised to see the truth so openly posted in an article like this…but you believe what you want & take chemicals pushed by the medical profession…eat what you want, drink what you want, don’t exercise and when things go wrong just take a pill….<br/>I attempted to look up these “Winsdor Papers” and even Google doesn’t know what you are talking about. If you really want to win people over, you should actually post links to the information you want us to read.<br/>Guys you all are missing one point: sodium is poisonous to us. Even if does not raise BP, its still poison ;/ not good at all<br/>@Marco: You would die instantly without sodium in your body.<br/>I am not the same Marco as Mr. “Salt is poison”. Just to be clear<br/>Of course – everything in excess is bad – heck, even drinking too much water will kill you.<br/>Now, every person is different so you have to find what works for you. Mine, I like salted 🙂<br/>This article is misleading. Just because salt’s negative effect on blood pressure is a “theory” doesn’t mean we should ignore it. In fact most of medicine and science is carried out on plausible theories. The truth is a low salt diet is less harmful than a high salt diet and like all things the real moral of the story is moderation. Also this author contradicts themselves by saying there is “no evidence… Yes none” to support this theory, but then goes on to cite at least one study that shows the negative corrolatuon in humans and another involving rats. That’s evidence, at least some not none. Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that. Sure sometimes we are far from knowing but in this case there’s enough science behind salts impact on BP to make it worth considering. Also remember the human consumption of high salt quantities is a fairly new thing on the evolutionary scale, so it’s impact on our bodies is fairly unnatural.<br/>@Mike: “No evidence… Yes none” I think Scott is meaning “No reputable evidence” Or, rather, “No evidence that is not flawed.”<br/>“Everything in moderation” Yep, exactly. As Scott is fond of saying, “Even water will kill you in high enough doses.” He even once told me a story of a woman he attempted to treat for this very thing- she drank massive amounts of water and ended up dying from it.<br/>“Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that.” I don’t think any doctors would ever say that. Maybe a century or two ago. But there is an amazing amount of good science involved here these days. We are far from knowing everything, but it’s certainly not black magic or just guess work, as that would seem to imply.<br/>Sorry to disagree with you Dave. But even on the sources of the video, the rise of blood pressure on high-salt diets is evident. While in the end of one of them, while talking about softdrinks and snacks companies:<br/>“Some of these companies have been preeminent in trying to create an artificial controversy doubting the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure,16,17 presumably in the hope of stopping or slowing down any reduction in population salt intake to protect soft drink sales.”<br/>Even, I’m not a specialist in the area, the lacks of a literature review in source about this matter is disturbing.<br/>oh diets that are processed foods with low fat high sugar high additive, observational studies are meaningless, these people are eating copious amounts of sugar each year. If you think corporations are trying to be allowed to use more salt its ridiculous distraction in doing anything to not look at the sugar metabolism syndrome epidemic.<br/>How moronic that you think observational studies matter for anything other than proposing a hypothesis, you then use intervention and double-blind placebo studies with no variables to prove them causal. THIS IS NOT DONE, this is also not done for cholesterol or saturated fat. You are a gullible victim of pathological science, when he says there is no evidence there is no evidence observational studies do no control for anything they are not an experiment, this is not how science works. You do understand cochrane are perhaps the most neutral group for clinical study in the world and they reviewed 150 trials and 13 population studies. Here you are saying their findings are wrong based on what? nothing other than your belief based on a hypothesis with no evidence.<br/>I suggest you read the book “Salt”. It is mostly a geopolitical historical account of salt in our civilization, but it also has a good deal of science in it. We built our civilization on salt.<br/>The first paragraph says ” just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence,” I believe that since this is a scientific minded website it shouldn’t use the word theory in this context, since in science, a theory is an accepted explanation of a phenomenon, proven by testing.<br/>Yeah, he should have used hypothesis. I’m going to have to look up the history of theory and see if anyone knows how it ended up with two such different meanings.<br/>For a medical professional (which leads to an assumption of advanced education), you have a horrible grasp of grammar and spelling. This discredits much of what you say, in my mind. Having someone else review your work before publishing would go a long way.<br/>I will continue to listen to my cardiologist on this matter and limit my salt intake.<br/>@Mark: Something you’ll find seemingly true about a large number of medical professionals, the stereotype of their handwriting being horrible is generally correct. (Scott’s is particularly bad.) And their technical writing can also sometimes be particularly terrible, pre-edit. (They study medicine and the human body, not writing, after all) But, in over 100+ articles Scott has written, he has never been shown to be wrong on a main point (and only a few cases of being wrong on a minor point). Typos? Awkward sentence? You will always find at least one of these in each of his articles, despite my sincerest efforts to get rid of them all. But in the end, I care about accuracy much more than grammar. Both would be good, but finding a writer of Scott’s particular expertise and ability to think critical and process vast amounts of medical knowledge is extremely difficult. These people aren’t a dime a dozen. 🙂<br/>But really, the strength of Scott’s arguments are never based on his extensive medical knowledge. That just helps him thoroughly vet the various studies on the subject where most would get lost in the terminology, let alone be able to think critically about them and their methodology. The strength of the argument is the studies themselves. In this one, you’d do well to actually read the two Cochrane reviews, and perhaps forward them to your cardiologist for his/her thoughts.<br/>Don’t be surprised if he/she has already ready them though, and maybe even agrees with them. What doctors tell their patients doesn’t always line up with what they actually know or believe to be true. Particularly in cases like this where lawsuits may be a very real possibility if they told you to eat all the salt you wanted, then you died of a heart issue (but having nothing to do with the salt), then your family sues them and cites what various government agencies say on the subject, rather than what the medical world actually thinks. 🙂 Watching your sodium isn’t likely to hurt either, but covers the cardiologists’ backside. (I actually had an interesting discussion about this with Scott just last night about a doctor he was discussing this with who said something very similar as to why despite that he knows sodium isn’t going to be harmful in this way, he still tells certain of his patients to watch their sodium intake.)<br/>In the end, as I always say, “Question everything,” but also when questioning, do the research to find the answers too, and then double check that research just to make sure. 🙂 And, maybe don’t make the mistake of equating grammar and writing ability with knowledge of a subject or intelligence. I’ve worked with a ton of writers. I can say, journalists (and other such people with a writing background) are great at writing… They almost all are horrid at research, which surprised me on the journalists, but maybe explains a lot about the state of media reporting on scientific studies. Funny enough, the best combo of writing ability and research seems to be lawyers. They are phenomenal at both in my experience. Scientists, or people with a science background, tend to be poor at writing, but incredible at research and critical thinking. Of course, that’s only going with a sample-size of a few dozen writers I’ve worked with, and there is one exception I’ve found in that, but it’s a trend I’ve observed.<br/>I think everyone must be different. For me salt raises my blood pressure a lot. I check the bl pr 4-6x a day. Stays low enough when i stay under 300 mg of salt. As soon as i eat a lot of salt, like chinese food or even a meat and cheese sub or two slices of pizza my bl pr goes to 170/98. It takes a couple days to get the salt out of my body. Then it will go down to 130/80 and sometimes a bit lower. I am 67.<br/>you just offered up things containing large amounts of simple carbohydrates, also containing wheat. Sugar has high osmolality but is ignored due to the weight applied to salt<br/>Dietary wheat elimination alone can lower bp by 20-40 mmHG. The company life extension says this also beneficially optimizes blood lipid profiles.<br/>Do you see how you are perhaps basing what you see on assumption based on what you have been told based on the hypothesis that has no evidence.<br/>cardiovascular issues in observational studies only found a correlation with people eating the very large amount of 5 grams of salt a day, you can imagine what amount of junk foods they are eating to attain this amount.<br/>If your problem is salt you have an underlying condition causing it because you are not getting a high amount in any way, however you are also ignoring other causes which is the problem when singular things are touted as the main contributing factor when no evidence suggests they are the cause.<br/>consider your cellular potassium, copper, lead exposure, magnesium, vitamin E intake, coq10 levels, irritants and stress that can increase coagulation and vessel constriction.<br/>If I may comment on the whole spelling/grammar controversy… in my experience from observing people, the populace (at least the intelligent ones, my whole family is high IQ and my husband is a genius, literally, and as I have no lower-intelligence friends for a control group, I can only speak from my observations of my family and husband’s family,) is divided into two types: math-people and word-people. My father was a math person, as was I when I was very small, however, I lived with my mother, who is most definitely a words person, my whole life, leading to my developing into a words person. My husband may very well be the smartest person I’ve ever met, but from his spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, you’d never know it. He’s a computer repair tech, can fix anything, highly versatile in his job abilities, can solve algebra problems that I’m struggling with for minutes at a time with just a glance, but can’t spell our son’s name.<br/>As far as I can tell, scientists tend to be math people more than word people. (Just for the record, one of my previous jobs was research, and I’m a grammar Nazi and sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>I was wondering if I could ask the author of this article for a small favor.<br/>At the beginning I read this sentence in regard to salt intake:<br/>“But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize [it is just a theory] and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence…”<br/>Here you are using “Theory” in its popular parlance. WHich is fine and all. The problem is that this is a scientific related article and when a theory is not supported by evidence we call it a “Hypothesis”.<br/>Those of us that write in the scientific realm should make an effort to make this distinction, mostly because the next time I get some Young Earth Creationist telling me evolution is “just a theory” I swear I am going to start jumping up and down like a Chimpanzee and make backward sammerault. Then I’ll throw feces at him/her.<br/>I am sure you don’t want such a scene to become reality. Heck, you probably don’t want to think it up in your mind.<br/>So let’s start a campaign to call a Theory a “a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena” and call anything that is meant to be pulled from one’s rear orifice an “Hypothesis”.<br/>BTW: I know the dictionary return both meanings. FOr the sake of Science, let’s change the meaning back since we already have a good working word for “I just pulled this out of my ass”.<br/>@Marco: That’s a good point. I’ll start working that distinction in to future articles. 🙂<br/>Not a single legitimate conclusion can be drawn from a single blood pressure measurement. BP varies widely even from moment to moment. I have many times seen 160/100 drop to 130/75 over the course of a few minutes. As well, BP measuring equipment is highly variable and susceptible to wide variations from things like cuff size and user variations.<br/>Any conclusions drawn from a few measurements are nothing more than speculation and wishful thinking.<br/>First, this is not a peer-reviewed journal article. I agree, the correct use of “theory” has been obfuscated by the colloquial “just a hunch” version. But, let’s move on, ok?<br/>I don’t get that the article is in the least bit misleading. I do get that the author makes the point that apparently is lost on many — “As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.”<br/>He also mentions to think critically. So, if you don’t believe him, a) continue with your belief, or b) find out for yourself. Do the legwork. Read the articles. Now you have a starting point. Thank him for that.<br/>In my opinion, focusing on the occasional grammatical error or “theory vs. hunch” debate unnecessarily diminishes the author’s intent. My takeaway is that this article helps challenge my assumptions about what I thought was already scientifically concluded. I learned something. That’s the point.<br/>@Michael Stelly I am not sure if you were referring specifically to my post in regard to the usage of “theory”, but I assure you that my comment was not intended to criticize the writer at all. At least not in the same terms as a grammatical or spelling “error”.<br/>My comment is not about an “error” rather it is a suggestion that those of us that read and write about science do our part to reclaim the usage of the word “theory” from the mainstream or that at least we try.<br/>There are those that comment on obvious spelling errors and I agree they are not important in the context of the information provided in the article (although I agree they can be distracting and I am speaking from a non native English speaker), but unless their number and character is such that they make understanding the article difficult or even impossible, you won’t find me posting about them.<br/>The word “theory” on the other hand is a word that is being actively used by certain factions of the science / religion discussion to discount 200 years of scientific advancement and it is being actively used to mislead children into discounting science as a whole.<br/>If you have watched the Nye – Ham debate, Gawker asked some creationists to write a question to evolution supporters on a piece of paper and they published these questions in the form of pictures. Invariably the “it’s just a theory” question appeared.<br/>It’s in that spirit that I have asked the curators of this website to try to use the word in its scientific meaning. If we in the science and technical fields don’t do that, we cannot expect those that want to distort science for their objectives to do it on their own.<br/>So, with all due respect, I won’t take your advice. I will certainly let slide silly spelling errors but this is important to me and it should be important to all of us that love science.<br/>no one distorts science more than evolutionists, inference and speculation based on an assumption of fact are not evidence. No field has as many hoaxes and assumptions as evolution.<br/>Continuing to use the flawed contrasting argument and assumption that because creation must be wrong evolution must be true is not science, the evidence does not show macroevolution to be possible at this point under any of the many current competing theories based solely on mutation and natural selection. I would suggest another mechanism must be found.<br/>As it stands contradictory evidence is completely ignored or even claimed as evidence of a more complex process but still a proof of evolution when it is no such thing in all cases.<br/>We currently have evidence for abiogenesis that it is an absolute fact as is microevolution absolutely correct, however, in terms of macroevoltuion I would suggest science returned to being based on evidence not an assumption of fact and skewing of data to induce it too fit the theory.<br/>As it stands evolution is not science it is a belief much like the big bang theory which has massive conflicting evidence that in the past when people used evidence to prove or disprove theories this theory would have been shelved, the combination of both these theories is akin to a religion, the religion of secular humanists. It is as political as they come the communities that uphold these beliefs black ball and ad hominem they cannot stand on the evidence but on intimidation. Studies show ad hominem is as useful as reasoned argument, this is used by illigitamate science suche as Co2 based climate alarmism and macroevolution which currently do not have evidence in their favor yet use the same types of propaganda and attacks suggesting anyone opposing them is anti-science or a moron.<br/>I suggest reading http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>People who do not agree with evolution don’t automatically believe creation, the evolutionist always attacks and distracts from their own weak argument creates their own strawman of what others believe and assume based on their own often moronic assumptions that they are backed by evidence when they are not.<br/>One fact I would like to add:<br/>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are another piece of evidence in this controversy. Interestingly, thiazides are called diuretics but when taken daily this diuretic effect becomes almost zero. After a period of chronic thiazide therapy, the primary benefit these medications provide is that they increase the elimination of sodium and chloride ions from the blood by way of the Na/Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule (along with other effects such as retention of calcium). Despite losing the diuretic effect thiazides retain their blood pressure lowering effects long-term and are one of the medications used first line for lowering blood pressure. This lowering effect is generally attributed to the elimination of sodium and seems to be in line with the idea that high sodium levels do increase blood pressure.<br/>Believe it or not. Salt appears to lower my BP. If I eat too many chips I actually get dizzy from low BP. Can’t say I get it.<br/>This “theory” is simply stupid. Salt DOES increase blood pressure big time! It’s a fact, observed, monitored. Accidentally eat some pretty salty stuff one day than needed a week of diuretics to get rid of all that salt from the body and bring the blood pressure from 190-200 (!!yes, that high it got!!!) back to normal (120-130). So don’t tell stories which aren’t true.<br/>Not all people respond the same to dietary salt. My suggestion for us is to take note of the sodium level in our normal lab results in minimal annual physicals.<br/>From childhood, I am used to take more salt with my meals, but never faced the problem of High BP, instead sometimes it goes below normal. I Googled this problem & came to the conclusion that my body needs salt more than normal to compensate for genetically transmitted ‘Low BP’ problem. So? Your Brain is the instructor for your health. You must follow its orders to stay Really Healthy!<br/>Well, I’m just a nutritionist (like a University Nutrition major that will be graduating in May) and maybe what I learnt is bull, but after being thought about the pathophysiology of how sodium can impact blood pressure, I find that the recommendation makes sense, but you would need to do more than just cut sodium. One thing that’s important is the sodium: potassium ratio (ie you eat a bunch of high processed, sodium added foods compared to fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables). I’ll admit that not everyone is salt sensitive and that we have consciously decided, in the health field, to assume that everyone is because testing for salt-sensitiveness (if that’s a word!) is expensive, long, and impractical. But the idea that there is no good plausible evidence linking salt and hypertension is false. Here’s just 6 articles. These aren’t the ones that were given by our professors to read (though if you want me to find them for you I’m sure I can), but they’re good one’s nonetheless and you don’t need a special University code or membership to access them. Anyways, here you go in case you want to read more:<br/>Do any of those show that there’s a correlation without other factors? You say “you would need to do more than just cut sodium”… is there evidence that doing those other actions without cutting sodium doesn’t work as well as cutting sodium too?<br/>Did you not read? Cochrane used 150 trials and 13 studies right? so you have 6, this is your “education” at work. Brainwashing and then confirmation biased search for support of the faulty hypothesis that has been found to be not of high quality already.<br/>If Cochrane did not use it it is not a high quality article, if it did then the support was not significant in the article. The osmolality mechanism applies to high sugar diets yet its all about salt<br/>The problem here is low quality studies are published constantly that people infer causation from where they can’t possibly do so as they did not control all the variables.<br/>The same thing is done for the lipid hypothesis and the cholesterol hypothesis.<br/>These are also myths, cholesterol from all data is inversely related to heart disease slightly.<br/>Statins absolute risk reduction for heart disease is 1.4% this is hardly significant, statins effects for decreasing heart problems in those already having a heart attack may be entirely due to their effect as an anticoagulant. Once again pathological junk science is being used to push treatments without recognizing mechanisms and variables. Most people will be harmed by inhibiting vitamin k coq10 and cholesterol synthesis via statins yet doctors backed by pharmaceutical greed promote giving them to everyone.<br/>Saturated fat has no mechanism via which it can raise cholesterol, no study of oil replacement purely substituted fat for oil in double blinds controls all variables and the closer they come to doing so the worse the outcomes for PUFA intervention becomes increasing all causes of death.<br/>Like is said the trials are low quality there is not much will to overturn hypothesis that regulating bodies and doctors have a religious belief in that is not backed by evidence. This misinformation leads to poor health and pharmaceutical profit.<br/>I have been torn between to eat more salt or not, because eating more salt reduces my heart rate and BP and makes me sleep better; my hands and feet feel full and warm. My sweat volume increase as I bike or walk. But then after taking it for a week or 2 then I notice that BP becomes persistently high; which makes me feel I did wrong by eating. What this article mentions is fluid volume increase which is interesting. Before increasing my salt intake my fingers feel thin. Maybe after fluid levels feel normal cut back on salt to normal levels. So I am just hypothesizing that people who have are salt sensitive have good fluid volume and should watch salt intake, others can take salt but stop when it feels full. Basically use salt maintain fluid volume.<br/>Based on self-experimentation, I think maintaining fluid volume is very important. At times, I find that I feel thirsty and drink water and that it keeps coming out; that calls for some salt intake. Basically, I do not eat canned food or much fast foods, my salt intake is what is purposely added in cooking. After exercise, (eating by the book and working out etc cause problems too) I notice that when I stand up from sitting position, I feel dizzy but not normally. I think I may be sweating out salt and , of course, I drink a lot of water during the exercise. I am not proposing eating more salt. What I am stating is the way the body is telling you that your salt is depleted is when you are not feeling full in your feet and hands. I think this is correct to some extent, as the body works more on concentration of things than the absolute amounts. It is not a comprehensive theory as there are other things that may increase blood volume, you may be already having too much salt in blood etc. For the record, my sodium in the blood is always near the low end of the range so my err wont push me outside of the range.<br/>Ok what is the conclusion? do I use the salt shaker now or not? I have been holding too long.<br/>I think this article is irresponsible in that salt absolutely does raise bp in those who have a salt sensitivity. If I eat something very salty I can literally go into hypertensive crisis in a matter of an hour.<br/>This type of sensitivity is common and to not mention it (because it does not fit with the authors theory?) is dangerous.<br/>@Jim porter: “because it does not fit with the authors theory?” The “author’s theory” doesn’t exist. That’s really not what we do here. This is an article simply writing about scientific studies on the topic and saying what they say, so you don’t have to sift through them and all the medical jargon; we do it for you- essentially what we write about reflects the current state of human knowledge on the subject at hand. If it changes at some point, we update the article. In this case, however, most notably the two Cochrane reviews are pretty convincing: “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.” There are exceptions to every rule, and seemingly you are one and that’s very interesting if so and it would be interesting to learn the root cause. But, again, we look at what the scientific studies say and try to reflect that in what we write. Essentially we write a form of “light-reading” style entertaining survey papers on subjects, rather than write research papers.<br/>Stressing about salt will likely kill you long before salt itself will. Do what makes you happy and you will likely live longer than otherwise; and even if you don’t, at least you’ll enjoy the time you have.<br/>I believe the problem is when salt is mixed with fat and THAT causes high blood pressure. For example, someone talked about theirs rising when eating crisps/chips-that’s because the chips contain fat. The same would apply say to french fries or other fatty dishes. However, if you were to sprinkle salt on something like fruit, it wouldn’t have the same effect and not raise your blood pressure.<br/>I do think sodium gets a bad rap and some people actually do consume too little. I think having salt with fruit or salads is o.k. but the problem is the salt/fat combination and if you think about it, that’s where people usually get their salt-in potato chips, french fries, heavily seasoning meats, in creamy dishes, etc.<br/>The person who wrote this article adds nothing of value to the discussion about high blood pressure except to encourage people to stick their heads in the sand.<br/>I have been wrestling with high blood pressure for about 12 years since a serious accident caused me to be physically inactive for about a year after the accident.<br/>High blood pressure can be controlled with and without medications and individuals respond differently to different treatments and there are natural cures for this affliction.<br/>High blood pressure can cause strokes, brain hemmorhages and contribute to diabetes and kidney disease.<br/>The balance between potassium and sodium in our blood is very critical and unfortunately most doctors don’t have a clue about the effect that nutrition and proper hydration has on this condition.<br/>Most of the doctors I have been to just give out prescriptions which may or may not work.<br/>There are natural substances which have enabled me to lower my blood pressure within a few days from extremely high to almost normal while doctors and pharmacists will say that medications (like Cozaar and Norvasc)may take up to a month to work.<br/>I’ve found that the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water<br/>had significant effects.<br/>Drinking this once or twice per day has had a very significant effect in my case; my blood pressure went from 220/95 to 130/90 within 3 days.<br/>Garlic (deodorized) also helps and fruit or vegetable juices with lowered salt content and high potassium content also help. (V-8 low salt or V-8 green).<br/>This is not wishful thinking; it has to do with chemistry; this doesn’t mean that everyone will respond the same to these treatments but I disagree very strongly when someone says that salt has no effect<br/>on blood pressure.<br/>This seems to me to be irresponsible and cavalier, unless of course you work for one of the salt manufacturers.<br/>Salt is necessary and most table salts have iodine in them, which is an essential nutrient for humans.<br/>Drinking sufficient amounts of pure water is also very important; something that my doctors never bothered to mention.<br/>This enables the body to rid itself of excess salt and helps the body cleanse itself.<br/>There are many natural substances and some foods (like pesto) which can help lower blood pressure and you can find many posts on the internet about them.<br/>Web Md and The Mayo Clinic both have posts on the subject and I trust them a hell of alot more than the author of this post.<br/>This appears to me to be an exercise in defending the indefensible.<br/>To what purpose?<br/>Who was Hippocrates anyway and what the hell did he know?<br/>I have extremely low blood pressure. If I stand up too fast, I’ll faint flat on my face. My doctor told me to eat as much salt as I want, no worries.<br/>In any case, I’ll take all of this advice with a pinch of… you know what. ;-D<br/>I eat a lot of salt (and I do mean a *LOT*). A few years ago after getting fed up with constantly being told how bad this is, I decided to put it to the test. As a Ph.D. I know how to scientifically plan a test, and over several months minimizing as many variables as possible, I tested my blood pressure while at my regular salt intake versus low salt intake. The results were pretty much as expected, although some people /may/ be slightly intolerant to relatively high levels of salt intake, for me there was no difference at all. I have returned to eating food the way I like it (salty), and tell anybody who advises against this they simply don’t know what they are talking about LOL<br/>I’m 27 female. I started having high blood pressure while I was taking Accutane a year and a half ago (Accutane increases cholesterol buildup). What I experienced was intense, my pulse was at 120bpm, I was dizzy, my hands clamped up into an unusual claw shape and they tingled until they lost feeling. I thought I was actually dying. I was told it was just a panic attack, but I’ve never had any real anxiety issues. I was given oxygen for an entire hour when suddenly I started craving salt. I asked my friend to run to mcdonalds and get me some extra salty fries. Within minutes of eating all that salt, my blood pressure was back to normal, my hands got their feeling back, and I could walk and breath normally again.<br/>I find the things that trigger it the most for me are a lack of sleep, not eating anything all day, corn, wheat, and chemical salts such as MSG. But sea salt and normal table salt don’t make it worse, they make it better! With that said, I’ve always had blood test results showing high levels of potassium. Could this somehow be involved? My Dr. Just shrugs it off as caused by my love for potatoes and citrus fruits lol<br/>You might need a new doctor high potassium or hyperkalemia can cause the episodes you describe and Accutane can cause hyperkalemia.<br/>Potassium and sodium are obviously related as your cells constantly exchange these into and out of cells to maintain higher intracellular concentrations of potassium.<br/>Cortisol which raises with sleep deprivation, not eating and other stresses reverses this process of potassium concentration into the cell, but is meant to increase potassium excretion, cellular uptake of sodium absorption and sodium retention in the kidneys, there may be something going wrong with this process with potassium not being excreted. The normal reason is the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system which regulates blood pressure.<br/>Salt nourishes adrenals but you might want to get some more vitamin C which is concentrated there as well as in the pituitary gland as these regulate your cortisol and vit c lowers cortisol and stress likely lessening the severity of episodes.<br/>Things to look into, magnesium, vitamin e, adrenal glandular, copper/zinc levels, kidney and adrenal function.<br/>Pharmacist here. Thank you for all the helpful comments on this site. One can see all the intelligently written posts from people who have reduced their high blood pressure by limiting salt. I am one of these people. My blood pressure a year ago was running on average 180/120 when not medicated, and when on 3 different medications, on average 140/90. After feeling awful, either from adverse effects from the meds or from headaches from high blood pressure, I decided to alter my diet. The results I achieved were stunning. Blood pressure perfectly normal, 120/80. No headaches, or feeling like my throat was swollen, or feeling like my head was too hot….I could go on and on. I did this with NO expensive products. I just, as much as is possible nowadays in the U.S., ate non-processed foods, and avoided all added salt. Notice, all “added” salt. As many have correctly pointed out, salt is necessary to human life. And many foods naturally contain all the salt we need, so it is not necessary to add any. Listening to these supposed experts, I wonder how any humans ever survived 10,000 years ago if they weren’t lucky enough to find a salt block to lick every day! I read one comment about someone who has had good results from “the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water”. I would challenge him and others to just try the lemon juice with water. I find that if I clean myself out with just one glass of lemon-water once a week, it has had a splendid effect on my health. The other ingredients may help, but it would be an interesting experiment for you. So I, like, many, many others, am sensitive to salt. Maybe some people can eat a huge amount of salt on a regular basis with no adverse health effects. That is not true for many of us, and it is offensive when so called “professionals” or “scientists” dispute this. One thing I always tell my patients, “When it comes to your health, trust yourself above all others”. If you are convinced a particular medication is making you feel sick, and your doctor or pharmacist imply it’s all in your head, trust yourself, not them. If you, like me, feel a thousand times better when you limit your consumption of salt or processed foods, then please, keep doing what you are doing, and don’t listen to those who suggest otherwise! You will be healthier and happier. Thanks for listening, my friends from far away.<br/>While it’s certainly possible that you are salt sensitive, when you decided to alter your diet, you changed many other things in addition to how much salt you ate. Two of the easiest ways to lower blood pressure without altering salt are 1. lose weight. 2. eat more veggies and fruits (aka foods rich in potassium). Numerous clinical and observational studies have shown that the sodium-potassium ratio is likely more important than how much sodium you eat. [Note that this only applies to the 99.999999% of humanity who eats between 3k and 6k mgs of sodium a day. Salt probably is a problem if you’re eating way out of the normal range, like 12,000mg + of sodium a day.]<br/>I was going to basically say the same thing. I had high blood pressure… I did a 30 day Paleo Challenge… All clean from the earth foods. I actually increased my salt intake by introducing a lot of salty beef jerky and pickled food into my diet for snacking. Not only did my blood pressure end up near perfect… I also lost 16 pounds. I wasn’t even someone you would really consider over weight to begin with… 178 lbs to 162 lbs in 30 days. My weird headaches were gone… the whole nine yards that come with high blood pressure. I’m convinced the salt and blood pressure are not related… and I think its a cop out to people who really need to get on an actual healthy diet.<br/>This article is dangerous and might convince someone to use all the salt they want. But all I have to do is eat a couple of big bags of Potato chips and I am getting 180/90 within a couple of days, stay off the salt then for 3-4 days and hydrate well, back to 130/70. Now “maybe” I am hypersensitive, but since this has repeated a half dozen times, I avoid salt. There is plenty in normal foods/<br/>Looks like you dont know what you are talking about… read Curt Nicol DD PhD entry below. and read again this article… you’ve been biased by exposure to the doctors who got biased by years and years of all the yada..yada..yada… read the article again. Of course, you are not going to start eating salt by the pound… everything would taste awful anyway.<br/>What is dangerous is advice and treatments with no scientific basis based on hypothesis alone, the collateral effect of reducing most peoples regular salt intakes is eating less processed food containing huge amounts of refined or simple carbs, highly oxidation prone oils, denatured substances, contaminants and additives.<br/>Reducing these will lead to improved overall nutrition.<br/>Limiting salt on its own with no other variables will show little to no effect in most people and can be detrimental to others.<br/>Me to. I’ve entered a detail comment of stop and start tests that 100% proved my hypothesis that Na was one of the large contributors to blood pressure. Takes an effort to document and record methods and result. Mine was as high as 205/115. I got it down to a consistent 100/65 for two years. My work is documented in this comment section but has yet to show up.<br/>A lot of people here saying that eating a bag of chips increases their blood pressure. Do they not realize it isn’t a health food? Do they think it possibly doesn’t contain all the wrong stuff?<br/>There has to be some other high sodium food they can use to show how salt affects their blood pressure.<br/>That’s right… what is bad is the oil and grease that is going the the pipes and constraining them… plus potato chips, it’s all starch, which turns to sugar, then fat …<br/>I would not be credulous enough to think for a minute, that salt is NOT related to high blood pressure, and increased body temperatures, for it certainly DOES. I reduced my 160 over 80 blood pressure down to 119 over 81 in a few weeks by cutting my salt intake severely. Why is it everytime I eat a several servings of potato chips, or eat Mc Donald’s french fries, I get immediately face flushed and feverish? I have even felt and heard, yes, the constricted veins in my own head, after having high blood pressure, dilate, expand, and break open again,after drinking cups, and cups of water, with the disappearance of the fever, disappearance of discomfort or congested head feeling, and reduced blood pressure.<br/>This really bothers me, and I have t confess to being somewhat confused now. I LOVE salt and can consume more in a single meal than you are supposed to consume in a day. It never seemed to affect my b.p.<br/>Then when my b.p. started increasing as I got older, my doc said to cut out salt. So I did…with no real effect. I was actually admitted into hospital with a serious infection, only to find that when I was discharged, I had been kept on a low sodium diet, even though on admission, my sodium level was dangerously low.<br/>This all made me believe that the dangers of sodium were only a myth, at least for me anyway. But then my wife got ill. Her b.p. was being constantly monitored as it kept going too low. They used to inject her with “sodium” (salty water I believe) and her blood pressure would come up almost immediately. This was intravenously however.<br/>So is it that I’m not salt-sensitive, or is it something about the stomach that acts a s barrier (so ingested salt does not affect you), while IV salt will?<br/>For something that is so fundamental in medical advice, it is so frustrating that there seems to be so little research, at least quality research done on it.<br/>Conversely, on a later admission to hospital, they had me on low sodium again (once and idiot puts it on your medical records, it seems impossible to get it off…) and gave me a blood pressure reducing medication. My b.p. dropped through the floor and was worrying them at one stage.<br/>BP medications are not evidenced to improve outcomes or be safe in most situations. Modern medicine is quite dangerous they kill people constantly with what they prescribe.<br/>Your wife may have kidney and adrenal problems while you more likely have vascular problems. Consider the possible environmental causes, you drink water with fluoride that increases absorption of lead, lack of antioxidants like ala, vit a/e/c/d/k2 can lead to increased oxidative stress arterial sclerosis and calcification of arteries restricting the ability of vessals to dialate, increased irritant exposure raises vasoconstriction and coagulation by increased seratonin release and lower amounts of nitric oxide produced by endothelial damage, low vitamin c leads to lessened collagen synthesis as does raised cortisol levels, both lead to poor circulation.<br/>These things can cause problems anywhere.<br/>I just spent an hour writing up a comment. My doctor wishes to see it. I doe not show up. What is going on? Did I waste my time? Please respond.<br/>Excellent article. Articles of this type bring out the health nutters and know-it-alls….just take a look at the comments. This also reminds me of the “global warming”….”climate change” (or whatever they are calling it this week) “experts” who preach it like it was gospel when they too have no definitive proof. | Чињеница или мит: Натријум повећава крвни притисак<br/>Па, Матт, испоставило се да исхрана са високим садржајем натријума не може подићи крвни притисак, нити имати било какав негативан утицај на кардиоваскуларно здравље уопште. Али ћу покрити теорију о томе зашто сол подиже крвни притисак испод - само схватите да је то само теорија и онај који није подржан већим делом било каквих чврстих научних доказа (и има више доказа који кажу да то не чини).<br/>Дебата о конзумирању превише соли постоји од 1960-их. Скоро свака велика владина здравствена организација прихвата идеју да је конзумирање превише соли штетно за ваше здравље. Већина главних медија извештава о овим препорукама и људи имају тенденцију да покушају да их прате. То је највероватније разлог зашто већина нас, посебно старијих са срчаним проблемима, зна да смањи количину соли коју једемо. Они од нас који воле идеју да било која препорука буде подржана чврстим доказима, морају се повући на овај. Као што је наведено, тренутно нема чврстих доказа да ће сол хронично подићи крвни притисак. Да, ниједан.<br/>Дакле, зашто је већина здравствених организација гурнула идеју ниске натријумске дијете? Теорија иза њихове претпоставке је звучна, а постоје и неке студије које показују мањи ризик од повишеног крвног притиска са изузетно високим уносом соли. Нажалост, постоје многе друге студије које не показују повећање, а још увијек неке које показују смањење уноса соли могу заправо подићи крвни притисак! Хајде да детаљније погледамо контроверзу.<br/>Идеја соли ће повећати ваш крвни притисак има везе са осмотским притиском. Осмоза је кретање растварача (у овом случају воде) кроз полупропусне мембране (као што су ћелијски зидови), из подручја са нижом концентрацијом раствора (у овом случају соли) у подручја са већом концентрацијом раствора. Ово природно изједначава концентрацију раствора на обе стране мембране. (Овај осмотски притисак је такође разлог зашто се сол може користити за очување меса.)<br/>Дакле, теорија иде да када једемо превише соли, наш крвоток има више натријума у њему од околних подручја нашег тела. То узрокује да се вода у тим подручјима увуче у наш крвоток. Повећање воде унутар артерија и вена узрокује повећање притиска унутар тих артерија и вена. Сама сол такође делује као иритант унутар артерија узрокујући их да се стежу. Такође се сматра да повећава ваш крвни притисак.<br/>Теорија изгледа, на површини, веома звучна. На крају крајева, можемо учинити да се процес слане воде која пролази кроз мембране дешава изнова и изнова у лабораторији. Питање је, да ли се то заправо дешава у нашим телима, и да ли то заправо узрокује дуготрајну хипертензију (висок крвни притисак)?<br/>1969. године, Луис Дал је сведочио пред сенатором Џорџом Мекговерном "изабрани одбор за исхрану и људске потребе". Био је забринут због високих концентрација натријума у храни за бебе и мислио је да то може изазвати повећање крвног притиска људи дугорочно. Његово размишљање је било да су студије учињене на пацовима показале повећање крвног притиска пацова.<br/>Разговор о соли и хипертензији почео је да циркулише међу здравственим организацијама. Национални институти за здравље, 1972. године, почели су да уводе "образовне програме високог крвног притиска". Као њихови докази, истакли су посматрачки, популације које су јеле врло мало натријума имале су ниске инциденте високог крвног притиска. Такође су указали на моделирање пацова. Научници у то време довели су у питање ово, јер су студије пацова имале да једу 60 пута више од просечне особе. Такође су указали на популације које су јеле дијете са ниским садржајем натријума, такође су јеле мале количине других ствари, као што је шећер (који такође утиче на осмозу).<br/>Упркос њиховим примедбама, јавно, идеја о исхрани са високим садржајем натријума која узрокује висок крвни притисак била је овде да остане и остаје данас. Центри за контролу болести, Национални институти за здравље, Америчко удружење за срце и многе друге организације тренутно промовишу дијете са ниским садржајем натријума.<br/>Упркос наизглед јединственом фронту који су представиле ове истакнуте организације, контроверзе међу научницима су изузетно загрејане. 1998. године, награђивани аутор Таубес, објавио је "Политичка наука о соли" у часопису Сциенце. Он је изјавио: "Контроверза око користи, ако их има, смањења соли сада представља један од најдуже трајања највитриотичнијих и надреалних спорова у целој медицини."<br/>Један генерални хирург у извештају је написао, брзина са којом су америчке федералне агенције прихватиле смањење натријума, "стала је у оштрој супротности са колико дуго је требало да се препоруке појаве о важности смањења нивоа холестерола у крви". Он је такође приметио да је разлика била још значајнија с обзиром на одсуство објављених истраживања која су заправо тестирала теорију. Са друге стране, сер Мицхеал Равлингс, предсједавајући Националног института за здравље и клиничку изврсност, који промовише дијете за смањење соли, тврдио је да се "смернице (у креирању политике) заснивају на најбољим расположивим доказима. Докази, међутим, можда нису веома добри и ретко су потпуни." Није јак аргумент за смањење уноса соли.<br/>Погледајмо неколико релативно скорашњих студија. У 2008. години, италијански истраживачи су почели да објављују резултате из низа клиничких испитивања, од којих су сви пријавили да, међу пацијентима са срчаном инсуфицијенцијом, смањење потрошње соли повећава ризик од смрти. Ове студије су пратиле друге које су показале међу дијабетичарима типа 1 и 2, здравим Европљанима и пацијентима са хроничном срчаном инсуфицијенцијом, они који су јели сол на доњој граници нормалног опсега вероватније су имали срчане болести од оних који су јели сол у средњем опсегу нормалног.<br/>У 2011. години, два Цоцхране прегледа нису нашла доказе да је дијета са ниским садржајем соли побољшала или погоршала здравље људи. "Након више од 150 случајних клиничких испитивања и 13 популационих студија без и очигледног сигнала у корист смањења натријума, друга позиција би могла бити прихватање да такав сигнал можда не постоји."<br/>Чак и упркос томе што нема јасних научних доказа који га подржавају, а неки напротив, у 2010. години Центри за контролу и превенцију болести, Институт за медицину и Америчко друштво за хипертензију наставили су да промовишу дијете са ниским натријумом као средство за контролу високог крвног притиска.<br/>На крају, као медицински стручњак и неко коме је потребан јасан доказ да донесе одлуку о томе да ли могу да додам обилне количине соли на мој помфрит, драго ми је да откријем да до сада има врло мало! Чини се да све главне здравствене организације промовишу дијете са ниским садржајем натријума, али нико није објавио доследне студије које показују да дијете са ниским садржајем натријума помажу у здрављу, посебно не у кардиоваскуларном здрављу. Оно што ме највише нервира, мој љубимац, је да ниједна од ових организација не говори људима да је наука иза њихове политике контроверзна и да могу бити у праву. Роналд Бајер, Дејвид Мерит Џонс и Сандро Галеа најбоље су то рекли у свом чланку "Со и јавно здравље" - "Након пажљивог разматрања дебате о соли, закључили смо да је прикривање научне неизвесности грешка која не служи ни циљевима науке нити доброј политици."<br/>Дакле, требало би да изађете и угушите све у соли сада? Као и код већине ствари, ако наука није била у стању да дефинитивно одговори на питање на овај или онај начин, и желите да будете сигурни, а не да се извињавате, само идите уз старо правило "умерености у свему". Ако, као и ја, волите да посолите све попут ивице чаше маргарите, а умереност је проклета, барем се сада можете осећати мало боље о томе, јер се чини да се наука све више нагиње према дијетама са ниским натријумом које су непотребне, а оне са високим натријумом уопште нису штетне.<br/>Ако вам се допао овај чланак и бонус чињенице испод, можда ће вам се свидети:<br/>Зашто сол повећава укус<br/>Шта значе бројеви у тесту крвног притиска и шта кажу доктору<br/>- Шта узрокује руке, ноге и ноге да "заспи"<br/>Топ 5 трикова прве помоћи које би сви требали знати<br/>Како уклонити мрље од свежег тепиха са ништа осим соли<br/>- Висок крвни притисак није ни болест ни болест сама по себи. То је само фактор ризика за друге проблеме. На пример, ако имате хронични висок крвни притисак, ризик од срчаног удара или можданог удара значајно се повећава. Овај висок притисак може бити узрокован прекомерним плаком на унутрашњој страни зидова артерија, чинећи те артерије мањим. Размислите о водоводу. Када се цеви које транспортују течност постану мање, притисак који исти волумен течности врши се повећава. Шта се дешава ако ваш крвни притисак постане превисок? Одговорићу на то питање са другим. Шта се дешава ако притисак воде у вашим кућама цеви постане превисок? Ваше цеви пукну. Иста ствар овде. Ако ваш крвни притисак постане превисок, ваше артерије имају већу шансу за пуцање. Ако унутар ваших цеви (плакета унутар артерија) има превише гунка, та кугла гунка може постати превелика и зачепити ваше цеви! Изгледа лоше и ја! Нарочито ако су те артерије у вашем мозгу или срцу. То није као бубрези, где имате два! Изађете из цурења у тим органима и ваша породица коначно добије ту велику плату од ваше политике животног осигурања! Није баш најбољи начин да се плати, добро, осим ако сте стварно кретен и сви у вашој породици те мрзи! Онда им можда не смета толико, али сигурно би.<br/>- Крвни притисак се мери у милиметрима живе. За референцу, 1 psi (фунта по квадратном инчу) је једнак 51.7149326 милиметара живе. Ако сте крварили и желели да зауставите губитак крви директним притиском, а требали бисте, само бисте требали користити око 3 ПСИ да бисте га зауставили. Осим ако немају стварно висок крвни притисак, онда можда 4 ПСИ. Основна математика поново штеди дан!<br/>- Први познати експеримент за мерење тачног притиска крви извео је Степхен Халес 1. децембра 1733. Он је узео живог коња. Причврстио је цев на њену леву круралну артерију, а затим је дозволио њеној крви да прође кроз цев и порасла је на висину од 8'3". Он је приметио да "када је била на пуној висини, она би се подигла и падала на и након сваког пулсирања 2, 3 или 4 инча". Да, коњ је искрварио, али немојте мислити да је господин Халес био превише окрутан, извршио је експеримент на коњу који ће ионако бити спуштен! За коња, сигуран сам да ова разлика није била битна.<br/>* Правно одрицање од одговорности: Иако сам медицински стручњак, овај чланак садржи опште информације о медицинским условима и третманима.

Проширити за Референце<br/>Поделите знање!<br/>Постајем све више и више убеђен да сол значајно повећава мој БП. Кад год једем чипс (чипс ако живите у САД) који имају прилично велику количину соли, мој БП значајно расте у наредних неколико дана.<br/>Покушао сам да добијем чипс без соли пре недељу дана и додао сам сопствену "ло-сол" (замена соли која се састоји од калијум хлорида и натријум хлорида (соли), али двоструко више од првог од другог).<br/>У сваком случају, чипс са укусом соли (чипс) диодн уопште не подиже мој крвни притисак.<br/>ОК Знам да су потребни даљи експерименти на себи. Али у овом тренутку јако сумњам у сол као кривца. Такође сумњам да шећер повећава и мој БП. Али потребно је много истраживања да се то утврди!<br/>Можда имате лошу равнотежу калијума на натријум. Моја мама има хипертензију и била је на дијети са ниским садржајем натријума, али није добијала довољно калијума и њен крвни притисак није био стабилан. Ако сте забринути, можда ћете желети да проверите ниво калијума у крви.<br/>Сада када конзумира довољно калијума, њен крвни притисак је нормалан више од годину дана, док конзумира натријум у нормалним опсезима (више од 2500 мг).<br/>То није натријум... то је масноћа и скроб који вас чини дебљим и дебљим; и то, да ли повећавате телесну масу и отежавате вашем срцу да пумпа крв кроз вене и артерије које се стисну у ваше тело повећаном количином акумулираног масти.<br/>једете чист крвави скроб и указујете на сол уместо шећера, све да бисте избегли инкриминацију шећера не помињемо превише биљно уље које повећава све узроке смрти. Добијате много више осмолалитета од шећера<br/>Потребни су чврсти докази? Није мит и врло је лако документовати - захтијева мало интелигенције или обуке, свако то може учинити. У доби од 52-54 године, то је било више од двогодишњег периода (2005. и 2006. године). Користио сам софтверски програм (Диет Повер 4 - платио сам 50 долара за то, али сада је бесплатан за преузимање) за праћење времена вежбања хране, натријума и бицикла. Произведени графови користећи методу оловке и папира, иако ће учинити исту ствар јер програм није имао одредбе за унос података о крвном притиску. Лекар који чита свака три до шест месеци је апсолутно безвредан по мом мишљењу ако се не уложи напор да се читање узме под истим околностима осим да се покаже општи тренд током неколико година.<br/>Открио сам да је за било какву вредност, за мој тип графикона и хипотезу (сада доказано), било је потребно узети неколико очитавања у периоду од најмање пет минута или док се не два близу (три или мање нумеричко ширење и не више од три бпм на срчаној фреквенцији) очитавања. Узео бих у обзир очитавања након две миље шетње или сат времена бициклизма по спорој до умереној стопи. Широке љуљашке преко пет минута одустају након што сам ушао у физичку форму и остао на дијети. Професионални сајтови препоручују седење 3 минута или више и узимање више од једног читања, али у последњих двадесет година имао сам само једног или два доктора који то раде, неки због потребе да брзо виде другог пацијента. Медицинска сестра је тврдила да је главни разлог за узимање очитавања крвног притиска осигуравајуће компаније инсистирале на томе. Она је тврдила да неки лекари нису погледали очитавања која је узела, тако да кога брига да ли је уложен напор да се добије тачно читање био је њен закључак.<br/>Уђите након што сте пожурили да се појавите на време, пењали се степеницама или шта год, седите, медицинска сестра зграби вашу руку и узме ваш крвни притисак. Једном сам убедио доктора да узме друго читање након десет минута разговора са мном о мојим медицинским проблемима. Он је тврдио да је ретко чекао, мушкарац са 15 година искуства, иако су професионални сајтови препоручили чекање три минута. Други лекар је тврдио да никада није чуо за На који врши крвни притисак (он је био војни лекар са различитим стандардима за образовање за које је тврдио).<br/>Сада на резултате. Графикони су били лепи и показали су савршену коалицију између пет уписаних фактора; тип хране, количине натријума, вежбање, срчани ритам, тежина.<br/>Био сам на медицини крвног притиска десет година са само нумеричком променом КСНУМКС-а. Такође сам био у седентарном запослењу и добио нулту вежбу. Моја тежина је била на горњем крају нормалне тежине или мало прекомјерне тежине. Ја бих јео типичне количине натријума за Американце (КСНУМКС + мг) током два дана. Затим разне количине ниског натријума за КСНУМКС дана, а затим постепено повећавају током периода од неколико дана. Након 72+ сати исхране са ниским садржајем натријума и програма вежбања, мој крвни притисак би значајно пао. 135/90 до 110/70 током три дана био је типичан након што сам био на свом плану исхране (ДАСХ дијета) месец дана. Нивои шећера и високе хемијске хране су такође забележени као део исхране. Унос натријума се појавио више од других вежби као највеће варијабле. Висока хемијска храна је такође показала разлику иако висока хемијска храна често има висок ниво натријума.<br/>Преко четири дана након наставка дијете ДАСХ дошло би до значајне и постепене промјене на горе. Потребно је два или више дана, у зависности од физичке активности и потрошње воде да се расипа натријум у крви је моја хипотеза, иако никада нисам потврдио ово из истраживања.<br/>Сумњам да ниво натријума за правилан крвни притисак варира између људи и различитих дизајна тела (род, раса, активност, маст вс мршав, ниво вежбања, итд.). Многи људи могу имати мали или било какав ефекат од КСНУМКС мг вс КСНУМКС мг На. Ја нисам један од оних. Процењује се да су пећински људи имали исхрану од 400 до 600 мг На. Оно што је било довољно добро за пећинске људе (који су имали кратке животе из других разлога) било је довољно добро за мене.<br/>Морао сам да се потрудим да останем на 600 мг због моје исхране. Дијета на којој сам био била је 200 до 400 мг ако се нисам присилио да користим тај шејкер за сол). Натријум је неопходан део ваше исхране. Нашао сам На количине преко 1000 мг превише за моје тело. Имам хипертензију и палпитације срца са кратким дахом. Моја лабораторијска очитавања штитасте жлезде постала су савршена и доктор ме је уклонио са лекова штитасте жлезде и лекова за крвни притисак. Моја палијација срца и кратак дах у 3 до 5 сати сваке ноћи престане након мјесец дана. Сви моји проблеми су се значајно наставили када сам сишао са свог плана исхране / вјежбе у посљедњих неколико година. Занимљиво је да је један старији доктор који је био у професији четрдесет година тврдио да сам само један од двоје људи који су отишли са нивоа ТСХ од 0,0 до 4,0 (горњи опсег нормалног) након напуштања лијекова. Проблеми са штитном жлездом наставили су се заједно са крвним притиском, палијацијом срца и срца. Сада сам наставио са исхраном и планом вежбања и праћењем. Послаћу ажурирање након три месеца.<br/>Ја сам само једна особа, па стави 400 људи на истом програму сам био на и видети шта се дешава. Проблем наравно је проналажење 200 поштених људи од оних 400 који не врше на исхрани и вежби базе података или претпостављам. Такође је потребно моћ воље да се држи програма. Заглавио сам са њим десет година, а затим одустао из разних разлога. Уклоните оне из базе података који не показују побољшање који одбијају да се закуну под заклетвом и узму тест детектора лажи!<br/>Сол (натријум) подиже крвни притисак. Отишао сам код доктора и мој крвни притисак је био 130/90. Рекла ми је да контролишем своју сол (натријум КСНУМКСмг лимит) и имао сам проверу два дана касније са мојим крвним притиском КСНУМКС / КСНУМКС. Сваки пут када једем пуно слане хране, добијам скок у свом притиску. Дефинитивно сам осетљив на сол.<br/>СОЛ (натријум) утиче на ваш крвни притисак. Морате бити опрезни (добро вам се прикрада) и прилагодите своју исхрану како бисте ограничили унос натријума и пазили на знакове повећања притиска. Поготово када се понашање вашег тела мења.<br/>Вежбајте такође! Ако сте лењи или не тако активни, узмите 30 минута шетње 5 дана у недељи (укупно 150 минута) најмање да бисте добили пристојну вежбу.<br/>Мислим да је поента у томе да је препоручивање исхране са ниским садржајем натријума, која можда утиче на одређени скуп људи, оних који већ имају хипертензију и осетљиви су на сол, читавој популацији смешно. Друга тачка је да ли висок унос соли доводи до хроничних кардиоваскуларних проблема, који се рекламира као чињеница јавности, али нема истраживања која би га подржала. Конзумирам много више натријума него што ЦДЦ препоручује и мој БП никада није био већи од 117/70, мој највиши икада, нормалан око 100-110/65-70. Ниједан од наших случајева не доказује на један или други начин ефекте "високог" уноса натријума на општој популацији.<br/>Можда имате низак ћелијски калијум, висок бакар, низак витамин к2, низак магнезијум, низак витамин Е, токсичност тешких метала као што је олово, сви су изложени олову и флуориду, ове ствари се међусобно комбинују.<br/>Погледајте услове који узрокују да имате ову осетљивост на сол, као што је низак ниво калијума високог кортизола.<br/>Немојте се само одмарати на соли, јер ћете вероватно имати вишеструке проблеме, као и скоро нико не једе сол сам по себи.<br/>Сол се генерално налази у високом једноставном шећеру без влакана хране са адитивима.<br/>Разумети смернице су за целу популацију не само за вас, ово је проблематично јер се нерафинисана сол не показује као нездрава за већину људи, а некима побољшава здравље и у изради ових смерница без препознавања биохемијске индивидуалности.<br/>Разумевање снижавања БПХ није све и крај свега, ово је механички учињено лековима у студијама које не показују побољшање исхода, па чак и погоршање симптома изван знака мерења БП.<br/>Ствари које треба размотрити, екстракт маслиновог листа, витамин е, витамин ц, витамин к2, калијум, куркумин, стевиа (природни заслађивач), магнезијум, гранит, л-аргинин, наттокиназа, рибље уље, какао, цвекла, алфа липоична киселина, бромелаин, ланено семе, целер, цок10, ланено семе, хавхорн Све ово побољшава БП и кардиоваскуларне проблеме. Имате много више у свом алату него што мислите<br/>Што се тиче шећера, жене треба да ограниче шећер (укупно угљених хидрата је оно што је важно и пазите на одређене шећерне алкохоле) 20г-30г ужину и 30г-45г сваки оброк. Мушкарци треба да задрже своју ужину исто као и жене 20г-30г ужину и 60г - 75г оброк. Најнижи бројеви су Имит за дијабетичаре, наравно.<br/>Верујем да неки људи имају осетљивост на натријум. Уверен сам да имам. Након што сам истовремено био на 3 различита БП лекова и још увек имао неконтролисану хипертензију, почео сам да читам етикете хране и драстично смањујем унос натријума. Већина прерађене хране је оптерећена натријумом. Успео сам да потпуно зауставим 2 лека и смањим трећу на 1/4 прописане дозе. За мене, смањење натријума је направило огромну разлику. Синоћ сам узео 10 мг лизиноприла, што је 1/4 прописане дневне дозе. Данас је мој БП пренизак, 105/48. Стварно морам да га доследно пратим, јер ниски БП такође није много забаве.<br/>Лекови за крвни притисак су неефикасни, не успевају да побољшају резултате само читање БП-а.<br/>Смањили сте унос ниског калијума са високим садржајем шећера и ниским садржајем влакана, ово ће увек смањити ваш крвни притисак.<br/>Сол није непријатељ вам је потребан само калијум и антиоксиданти да га уравнотежи и смањи стрес.<br/>Када људи смањују натријум на овај начин не можете допринети самој соли, потпуно сте променили свој унос у исхрани многих ствари, овако се људи могу преварити да мисле да је то једна ствар.<br/>Ово приписивање јединственог узрока проблемима се стално врши у хипотези и они имају тенденцију да буду потпуно лажни демонизирајући јединствене ствари као што су Цо2, со, засићене масти, холестерол, недостатак серотонина, чак и недостатак употребе отровних флуорида.<br/>То су сви митови који не успевају под пажњом, али се и даље подржавају као узроци регулисањем тела бирањем трешње и одбацивањем минимизирања огромних контрадикција. Фармацеутске корпорације за нездраву храну и биљно уље имају користи и дезинформишу јавност за профит којима ФДА изнуђује њихову конкуренцију.<br/>Медицинска истраживања и већина других истраживања представљају инцестуозну превару између приватног интереса и подстицања економије, као и лекара политичара и владиног профита.<br/>Уредници студија часописа објављени су у проналажењу већине студија које у потпуности недостају, закључци који се врте ка пристрасности потврде и да смо у прилично мрачном добу за науку где су веровање, консензус и вршњачка рецензија мање о доброј науци, а више о конкурентном веровању и доказима који ће оштетити профит и будуће.<br/>Да, шта год. Верујте шта желите. Читао сам здравствене књиге годинама....ДЕЦЕНИЈЕ...и прочитао сам у њима управо оно што је штампано у овом чланку. НИКАДА није доказано да постоји веза између соли и високог крвног притиска. Осим тога, у једној од књига истакао је да се сол користи за израду желудачне киселине, а иронично је да како старимо, исхрана са ниским садржајем натријума која се често рекламира доводи до пробавних проблема.<br/>Наставите да верујете лекарима који узимају 3 кредита за исхрану на колеџу и једињења која узрокују горе нежељене ефекте од стварне болести.<br/>Доктори, који кажу да киропрактика није прави лек. Доктор који је покушао да докаже да је Цхиро лажан тако што је обавио обдукцију открио је да је 99 од 100 неуспеха органа било због недостатка нервне енергије узроковане "сублуксацијама" које штипају нерве и прекидају проток енергије нерва. (Ја нисам киропрактичар).<br/>Иди читати књиге Нормана Вокера, (посебно "Свеже воће и поврће."), ТЦ Фри, и Херберт М. Схелтон (Супериор Нутритион, Пост може спасити живот). Прочитао сам их све.<br/>БОТТОМ ЛИНЕ ово је одличан чланак и заправо сам изненађен што видим истину тако отворено објављену у чланку као што је овај ... али верујете у оно што желите и узимате хемикалије које гура медицинска професија ... једите оно што желите, пијте оно што желите, не вежбајте и када ствари крену наопако само узмите пилулу. ...<br/>Покушао сам да погледам ове "Винсдор папире", па чак и Гоогле не зна о чему причате. Ако заиста желите да освојите људе, требало би да поставите линкове на информације које желите да прочитамо.<br/>Момци сви сте пропустили једну тачку: натријум је отрован за нас. Чак и ако не подигне БП, његов још увек отров ; / није добро уопште<br/>@Марцо: Ви бисте одмах умрли без натријума у вашем телу.<br/>Ја нисам исти Марко као господин "Со је отров." Само да будем јасан<br/>Наравно - све у вишку је лоше - дођавола, чак и пије превише воде ће вас убити.<br/>Сада, свака особа је другачија, тако да морате пронаћи оно што ради за вас. Моја, волим слано<br/>Овај чланак је погрешан. Само зато што је негативан ефекат соли на крвни притисак "теорија" не значи да га треба игнорисати. У ствари, већина медицине и науке се спроводи на веродостојним теоријама. Истина је да је исхрана са ниским садржајем соли мање штетна од исхране са високим садржајем соли и као и све ствари прави морал приче је умереност. Такође, овај аутор се супротставља себи рекавши да "нема доказа ... Да ниједан" да подржи ову теорију, али онда иде на цитира барем једну студију која показује негативну королатуон код људи и други који укључују пацове. То је доказ, барем неки не ниједан. Већина медицине је црна магија и многи лекари ће то признати. Наравно, понекад смо далеко од знања, али у овом случају има довољно науке иза утицаја соли на БП да би то било вредно разматрања. Такође запамтите да је људска потрошња великих количина соли прилично нова ствар на еволуционој скали, тако да је њен утицај на наша тела прилично неприродан.<br/>@Мајк: "Нема доказа... Да нема" Мислим да Скот значи "Нема угледних доказа" или, боље речено, "Нема доказа који нису погрешни."<br/>"Све у умерености" Да, тачно. Као што Скот воли да каже, "Чак и вода ће вас убити у довољно високим дозама." Чак ми је једном испричао причу о жени коју је покушао да третира баш за ову ствар - пила је огромне количине воде и на крају умрла од тога.<br/>"Већина медицине је црна магија и многи лекари ће то признати." Мислим да ниједан лекар то никада не би рекао. Можда пре једног века или два. Али ових дана овде је укључена невероватна количина добре науке. Далеко смо од тога да знамо све, али то свакако није црна магија или само нагађање рада, како се чини да то подразумева.<br/>Жао ми је што се не слажем са вама, Даве. Али чак и на изворима видеа, пораст крвног притиска на дијетама са високим садржајем соли је очигледан. Док је на крају један од њих, док говоримо о компанијама за безалкохолна пића и грицкалице:<br/>"Неке од ових компанија су биле истакнуте у покушају да створе вештачку контроверзу која сумња у везу између уноса соли и крвног притиска, вероватно у нади да ће зауставити или успорити било какво смањење уноса соли у популацији како би се заштитила продаја безалкохолних пића."<br/>Чак и, нисам специјалиста у овој области, недостатак прегледа литературе у извору о овом питању је узнемирујући.<br/>Ох дијете које су прерађене хране са ниским садржајем масти високог шећера висок адитив, опсервационе студије су бесмислене, ови људи једу обилне количине шећера сваке године. Ако мислите да корпорације покушавају да им се дозволи да користе више соли, то је смешно одвлачење пажње у томе да не гледају на епидемију синдрома метаболизма шећера.<br/>Како морон да мислите да опсервационе студије значе за било шта друго осим што предлаже хипотезу, онда користите интервенцију и двоструко слепе плацебо студије без варијабли да их докаже узрочно. Ово није учињено, то се такође не ради за холестерол или засићене масти. Ви сте наивна жртва патолошке науке, када каже да нема доказа, нема доказа, опсервационе студије не контролишу ништа што није експеримент, то није начин на који наука функционише. Да ли разумете да су кокрани можда најнеутралнија група за клиничку студију на свету и прегледали су 150 испитивања и 13 студија становништва. Овде кажете да су њихови налази погрешни на основу чега? Ништа друго него твоје веровање засновано на хипотези без доказа.<br/>Предлажем да прочитате књигу "Сол". То је углавном геополитички историјски рачун соли у нашој цивилизацији, али има и доста науке у њој. Изградили смо нашу цивилизацију на соли.<br/>Први параграф каже "само схватите да је то само теорија и онај који није подржан великим делом било каквих чврстих научних доказа", верујем да, пошто је ово научни сајт, не би требало да користи теорију речи у овом контексту, јер у науци, теорија је прихваћено објашњење феномена, доказано тестирањем.<br/>Мораћу да погледам историју теорије и видим да ли неко зна како је завршила са два оваква различита значења.<br/>За медицинског стручњака (што доводи до претпоставке напредног образовања), имате ужасно схватање граматике и правописа. Ово дискредитује много онога што кажете, по мом мишљењу. Имати неког другог да прегледа ваш рад пре објављивања би прошао дуг пут.<br/>Наставићу да слушам свог кардиолога о овом питању и ограничити унос соли.<br/>@Марк: Нешто што ћете наизглед наћи истинито о великом броју медицинских стручњака, стереотип њиховог рукописа који је ужасан је генерално тачан. (Сцоттово је посебно лоше.) И њихово техничко писање такође понекад може бити посебно страшно, унапред уређивање. (Они проучавају медицину и људско тело, а не писање, на крају крајева) Али, у преко 100 чланака које је Скот написао, никада није показао да греши у главној тачки (и само неколико случајева да је погрешио у малој тачки). Типови? Неугодна реченица? Увек ћете наћи барем један од њих у сваком од његових чланака, упркос мојим искреним напорима да их се отарасим. Али на крају, бринем о тачности много више од граматике. Оба би била добра, али проналажење писца Сцоттове посебне експертизе и способности да критички размишљају и обрађују огромне количине медицинског знања је изузетно тешко. Ови људи нису десетак.<br/>Али у стварности, снага Скотових аргумената никада није заснована на његовом опсежном медицинском знању. То му само помаже да темељно провери разне студије на тему где би се већина изгубила у терминологији, а камоли да критички размишља о њима и њиховој методологији. Снага аргумента је сама студија. У овом, било би добро да заправо прочитате два Цоцхране прегледа, и можда их проследите свом кардиологу за његове / њене мисли.<br/>Немојте се изненадити ако их је већ припремио, а можда се чак и слаже са њима. Оно што доктори кажу својим пацијентима не одговара увек ономе што заправо знају или верују да је истина. Посебно у оваквим случајевима где тужбе могу бити врло реална могућност ако су вам рекли да једете сву сол коју желите, онда сте умрли од срчаног проблема (али немајући никакве везе са соли), онда их ваша породица тужи и наводи шта различите владине агенције говоре о тој теми, а не шта медицински свет заправо мисли. Гледање вашег натријума вероватно неће повредити ни, али покрива леђа кардиолога. (Заправо сам имао занимљиву дискусију о томе са Сцоттом тек синоћ о доктору који је о томе разговарао са којим је рекао нешто врло слично зашто, упркос томе што зна да натријум неће бити штетан на овај начин, он и даље говори неким својим пацијентима да гледају унос натријума.)<br/>На крају, као што увек кажем, "Питај све", али и када испитујете, урадите истраживање да бисте пронашли одговоре, а затим двапут проверите то истраживање само да бисте били сигурни. И, можда, не правите грешку изједначавања граматике и писања са знањем субјекта или интелигенције. Радио сам са тоном писаца. Могу рећи, новинари (и други такви људи са позадином писања) су одлични у писању ... Скоро сви су ужасни у истраживању, што ме је изненадило на новинарима, али можда објашњава пуно о стању медија који извештавају о научним студијама. Смешно, изгледа да су најбоља комбинација писања и истраживања адвокати. Научници, или људи са научном позадином, имају тенденцију да буду сиромашни у писању, али невероватни у истраживању и критичком размишљању. Наравно, то иде само са величином узорка од неколико десетина писаца са којима сам радио, и постоји један изузетак који сам пронашао у томе, али то је тренд који сам приметио.<br/>Мислим да сви морају бити другачији. За мене сол много подиже крвни притисак. Проверавам бл пр 4-6к дневно. Остаје довољно ниско када останем испод 300 мг соли. Чим поједем пуно соли, као што је кинеска храна или чак месо и сира или два кришка пице, мој бл пр иде на 170/98. Потребно је неколико дана да се сол извуче из мог тела. Онда ће се спустити на 130/80, а понекад и мало ниже. Имам 67.<br/>управо сте понудили ствари које садрже велике количине једноставних угљених хидрата, које такође садрже пшеницу. Шећер има високу осмолалност, али се игнорише због тежине која се примењује на сол<br/>Дијетална елиминација пшенице сама може смањити бп за 20-40 ммХГ. Продужење живота компаније каже да ово такође корисно оптимизује профиле липида у крви.<br/>Да ли видите како можда заснивате оно што видите на претпоставци на основу онога што вам је речено на основу хипотезе која нема доказе.<br/>Кардиоваскуларни проблеми у опсервационим студијама пронашли су само корелацију са људима који једу веома велику количину 5 грама соли дневно, можете замислити колико брзе хране једу да би постигли ову количину.<br/>Ако је ваш проблем сол, имате основно стање које га узрокује, јер не добијате високу количину на било који начин, али игноришете и друге узроке, што је проблем када се јединствене ствари рекламирају као главни фактор који доприноси када нема доказа који указују на то да су узрок.<br/>размотрите свој ћелијски калијум, бакар, изложеност олову, магнезијум, унос витамина Е, нивое Цок10, иританти и стрес који могу повећати коагулацију и сужавање посуда.<br/>Ако могу да коментаришем читаву правописну / граматичку контроверзу ... у мом искуству посматрања људи, становништво (барем оних интелигентних, моја цела породица је висок ИК и мој муж је геније, буквално, и пошто немам пријатеље ниже интелигенције за контролну групу, могу само да говорим из мојих запажања моје породице и породице мужа,) је поде у два типа: Мој отац је био математичар, као што сам био и ја када сам био веома мали, међутим, живео сам са својом мајком, која је дефинитивно реч особа, цео мој живот, што је довело до тога да се развијам у реч особу. Мој муж је можда најпаметнија особа коју сам икада срео, али из његовог правописа, граматике и вокабулара, никада не бисте знали. Он је техничар за поправку рачунара, може да поправи било шта, веома свестран у својим радним способностима, може да реши алгебарске проблеме са којима се борим неколико минута у исто време са само једним погледом, али не може да напише име нашег сина.<br/>Колико ја могу да кажем, научници имају тенденцију да буду људи математике више од људи речи. (Само да се зна, један од мојих претходних послова био је истраживање, а ја сам граматичар нациста и сескуипедалиан.<br/>Питао сам се да ли могу да замолим аутора овог чланка за малу услугу.<br/>На почетку сам прочитао ову реченицу у вези са уносом соли:<br/>"Али ћу покрити теорију о томе зашто сол подиже крвни притисак испод - само схватите [то је само теорија] и онај који није подржан већином било каквих чврстих научних доказа."<br/>Овде користите "Теорија" у свом популарном говору. ВХицх је у реду и све. Проблем је у томе што је ово чланак везан за науку и када теорија није подржана доказима називамо га "Хипотеза".<br/>Они од нас који пишу у научном подручју треба да се потруде да направе ову разлику, углавном зато што следећи пут када ми неки креациониста Младе Земље каже да је еволуција "само теорија", кунем се да ћу почети да скачем горе-доле као шимпанза и да ћу направити натраг саммераулт. Онда ћу бацити фекалије на њега / њу.<br/>Сигуран сам да не желиш да таква сцена постане стварност.<br/>Дакле, хајде да покренемо кампању да Теорију назовемо „кохерентном групом тестираних општих пропозиција, које се обично сматрају тачним, које се могу користити као принципи објашњења и предвиђања за класу појава“ и да назовемо све што је намењено да се извуче из нечијег задњег отвора „Хипотеза“.<br/>БТВ: Знам да речник враћа оба значења. Зарад науке, хајде да променимо значење јер већ имамо добру радну реч за "Управо сам ово извукао из дупета".<br/>@Марцо: То је добра поента. Почећу да радим ту разлику у будућим чланцима.<br/>Ниједан легитиман закључак не може се извући из једног мерења крвног притиска. БП варира од тренутка до тренутка. Видела сам много пута 160/100 пад на 130/75 током неколико минута. Такође, БП мерна опрема је веома варијабилна и подложна широким варијацијама од ствари као што су величина манжете и варијације корисника.<br/>Сваки закључак изведен из неколико мерења није ништа више од спекулација и размишљања о жељама.<br/>Прво, ово није рецензирани чланак у часопису. Слажем се, исправна употреба "теорије" је замагљена колоквијалном верзијом "само наговештај". Али, хајде да кренемо даље, у реду?<br/>Не схватам да је чланак у најмању руку обмањујући. Схватам да аутор чини тачку да је очигледно изгубљен на многима - "Као што је речено, тренутно нема чврстих доказа да ће сол хронично подићи крвни притисак. Да, ниједан."<br/>Он такође помиње да критички размишља. Дакле, ако му не верујете, а) наставите са својим уверењем, или б) сазнајте за себе. Урадите ноге. Прочитајте чланке. Сада имате почетну тачку. Хвала му за то.<br/>По мом мишљењу, фокусирање на повремену граматичку грешку или дебату "теорија против предосећаја" непотребно умањује намеру аутора. Моја предност је да овај чланак помаже да се оспоре моје претпоставке о ономе што сам мислио да је већ научно закључено. Научио сам нешто, у томе је поента.<br/>@Мицхаел Стелли Нисам сигуран да ли сте се посебно односили на мој пост у вези са употребом "теорије", али уверавам вас да мој коментар уопште није имао за циљ да критикује писца. Барем не у истом смислу као граматичка или правописна "грешка".<br/>Мој коментар није о "грешци", већ је сугестија да ми који читамо и пишемо о науци учинимо свој део да повратимо употребу речи "теорија" од мејнстрима или да бар покушамо.<br/>Постоје они који коментаришу очигледне правописне грешке и слажем се да нису важни у контексту информација које се налазе у чланку (иако се слажем да могу бити ометајуће и говорим од не-матерњи енглески говорник), али осим ако њихов број и карактер је такав да они чине разумевање чланка тешко или чак немогуће, нећете наћи ме објављивање о њима.<br/>С друге стране, реч „теорија“ је реч која се активно користи од стране одређених фракција у дискусији о науци/религији да би се занемарило 200 година научног напретка и активно се користи за завођење деце у дисконтирање науке у целини.<br/>Ако сте гледали дебату Ние-Хам, Гавкер је замолио неке креационисте да напишу питање присталицама еволуције на комаду папира и они су објавили ова питања у облику слика. Увек се појавило питање "то је само теорија".<br/>У том духу сам замолио кустосе овог сајта да покушају да користе реч у њеном научном значењу. Ако ми у науци и техничким областима то не урадимо, не можемо очекивати да они који желе да искривљују науку за своје циљеве то раде сами.<br/>Дакле, уз дужно поштовање, нећу прихватити ваш савет. Дефинитивно ћу пустити глупе правописне грешке, али ово је важно за мене и требало би да буде важно за све нас који волимо науку.<br/>нико не искривљује науку више од еволуциониста, закључак и спекулације засноване на претпоставци чињенице нису докази. Ниједно поље нема толико превара и претпоставки као еволуција.<br/>Настављајући да користимо погрешан контрастни аргумент и претпоставку да зато што стварање мора бити погрешно, еволуција мора бити истинита није наука, докази не показују да је макроеволуција могућа у овом тренутку под било којом од многих тренутних конкурентских теорија заснованих искључиво на мутацији и природној селекцији. Предлажем да се нађе други механизам.<br/>Контрадикторни докази се потпуно игноришу или чак тврде као докази о сложенијем процесу, али ипак доказ еволуције када то није тако у свим случајевима.<br/>Тренутно имамо доказе за абиогенезу да је то апсолутна чињеница, као што је микроеволуција апсолутно тачна, међутим, у смислу макроеволуције, предложио бих да се наука врати на основу доказа, а не претпоставка чињеница и извртање података да би га изазвало превише одговара теорији.<br/>Како стоји еволуција није наука, то је веровање слично теорији великог праска која има масивне контрадикторне доказе да у прошлости, када су људи користили доказе да докажу или оповргну теорије које би ова теорија била одбачена, комбинација обе ове теорије је слична религији, религији секуларних хуманиста. То је као политички као што долазе заједнице које подржавају ова веровања црну лопту и ад хоминем не могу стајати на доказима, али на застрашивање. Студије показују да је ad hominem корисна као аргументована аргументација, ово се користи од стране нелигитаматне науке, као што су Цо2 засновани климатски алармизам и макроеволуција, који тренутно немају доказе у своју корист, али користе исте врсте пропаганде и напада који сугеришу да је било ко који им се супротставља антинаука или морон.<br/>Предлажем читање http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>Људи који се не слажу са еволуцијом аутоматски не верују у стварање, еволуционисти увек нападају и одвлаче пажњу од сопственог слабог аргумента, стварају сопствене трагмане онога у шта други верују и претпостављају на основу сопствених често идиотских претпоставки да су подржани доказима када то нису.<br/>Једна чињеница коју бих желео да додам:<br/>Тиазидни и тиазидни диуретици су још један доказ у овој контроверзи. Занимљиво је да се тиазиди називају диуретици, али када се узимају дневно, овај диуретички ефекат постаје скоро нула. Након периода хроничне терапије тиазидима, примарна корист коју ови лекови пружају је да повећавају елиминацију натријума и хлоридних јона из крви путем На / Цл симпортера у дисталном заплетеном тубулу (заједно са другим ефектима као што је задржавање калцијума). Упркос губитку диуретског ефекта, тиазиди задржавају дугорочне ефекте снижавања крвног притиска и један су од лекова који се користе у првој линији за снижавање крвног притиска. Овај ефекат снижавања се генерално приписује елиминацији натријума и чини се да је у складу са идејом да високи нивои натријума повећавају крвни притисак.<br/>Веровали или не. Изгледа да сол снижава мој крвни притисак. Ако поједем превише чипса, заправо се врти од ниског крвног притиска. Не могу рећи да га добијем.<br/>Ова "теорија" је једноставно глупа. Сол ДАЛИ повећава крвни притисак велики пут! То је чињеница, примећена, надгледана. Случајно јести неке прилично слане ствари једног дана него што је потребно недељу дана диуретика да се ослободи све те соли из тела и довести крвни притисак од 190-200 (!! да, да је висок је добио!!!) вратити у нормалу (120-130). Зато немојте причати приче које нису истините.<br/>Нису сви људи подједнако реагују на дијеталну сол. Мој предлог за нас је да узмемо у обзир ниво натријума у нашој нормалној лабораторији, што резултира минималним годишњим физикама.<br/>Од детињства сам навикао да узимам више соли са оброком, али се никада нисам суочио са проблемом високог БП, уместо тога понекад иде испод нормалног. Гооглед сам овај проблем и дошао до закључка да моје тело треба соли више него нормално да надокнади генетски преноси "низак БП" проблем. Дакле? Ваш мозак је инструктор за ваше здравље. Морате пратити његова наређења да останете Стварно здрави!<br/>Па, ја сам само нутрициониста (као универзитетски нутрициониста који ће дипломирати у мају) и можда оно што сам научио је бик, али након размишљања о патофизиологији како натријум може утицати на крвни притисак, сматрам да препорука има смисла, али морате учинити више него само смањити натријум. Једна ствар која је важна је натријум: однос калијума (тј. Једете гомилу високо обрађених, натријумских додатих намирница у поређењу са свежим или смрзнутим воћем и поврћем). Признајем да нису сви осетљиви на сол и да смо свесно одлучили, у области здравља, да претпоставимо да су сви зато што је тестирање осетљивости на сол (ако је то реч!) скупо, дуго и непрактично. Али идеја да не постоје добри уверљиви докази који повезују со и хипертензију је лажна. Ево само 6 чланака. Ово нису оне које су наши професори дали да читају (иако ако желите да их нађем за вас сигуран сам да могу), али ипак су добри и не треба вам посебан универзитетски код или чланство да бисте им приступили. У сваком случају, овде идете у случају да желите да прочитате више:<br/>Да ли било који од њих показују да постоји корелација без других фактора? Кажете "требало би да урадите више него само смањити натријум" ... да ли постоје докази да раде те друге акције без сечења натријум не ради као и сечење натријум превише?<br/>Зар нисте прочитали? Цоцхране је користио 150 суђења и 13 студија у праву? тако да имате КСНУМКС, ово је ваше "образовање" на послу. Испирање мозга, а затим потврда пристрасна потрага за подршком неисправне хипотезе за коју је утврђено да већ није високог квалитета.<br/>Ако га Цоцхране није користио, то није висококвалитетни чланак, ако јесте, онда подршка није била значајна у чланку. Механизам осмолалности се односи на дијете са високим садржајем шећера, али је све о соли<br/>Проблем је у томе што се студије ниског квалитета објављују стално да људи закључују узрочност одакле то не могу учинити јер нису контролисали све варијабле.<br/>Исто се ради и за хипотезу о липидима и хипотезу о холестеролу.<br/>То су такође митови, холестерол из свих података је обрнуто повезан са срчаним обољењима.<br/>Апсолутно смањење ризика од срчаних обољења статина је 1,4%, што је тешко значајно, ефекти статина за смањење срчаних проблема код оних који већ имају срчани удар могу бити у потпуности због њиховог ефекта као антикоагуланта. Наука о патолошким смећима се још једном користи за гурање третмана без препознавања механизама и варијабли. Већина људи ће бити оштећена инхибирањем синтезе витамина к цок10 и холестерола путем статина, али лекари подржани фармацеутском похлепом промовишу давање свима.<br/>Засићене масти немају механизам преко којег могу подићи холестерол, нема студије о замјени уља чисто замијењене масти за уље у двоструким слепим контролама свих варијабли и што су ближе томе, лошији исходи за ПУФА интервенцију постају повећање свих узрока смрти.<br/>Као што је речено суђења су лошег квалитета нема много воље да се поништи хипотезу да регулисање тела и лекари имају верско уверење у које није подржан доказима. Ова дезинформација доводи до лошег здравља и фармацеутске профита.<br/>Био сам подељен између да једем више соли или не, јер конзумирање више соли смањује мој срчани ритам и БП и чини да спавам боље; моје руке и ноге се осећају пуне и топле. Мој волумен зноја се повећава док возим бицикл или ходам. Али онда након што га узмем недељу дана или КСНУМКС тада примећујем да БП постаје упорно висок; што ме чини да се осећам да сам погрешио једењем. Оно што овај чланак помиње је повећање запремине течности што је занимљиво. Пре него што повећам унос соли, прсти се осећају танко. Можда се након нивоа течности осећају нормално смањити сол на нормалне нивое. Дакле, ја само претпостављам да људи који имају осетљиве на сол имају добру запремину течности и треба да гледају унос соли, други могу да узимају сол, али престану када се осећају пуни. У суштини користите сол за одржавање запремине течности.<br/>На основу само-експеримента, мислим да је одржавање волумена течности веома важно. Понекад откријем да осећам жеђ и пијем воду и да стално излази; то захтева неки унос соли. У суштини, не једем конзервирану храну или много брзе хране, мој унос соли је оно што се намерно додаје у кување. Након вежбања, (једење по књизи и вежбање итд. Изазвати проблеме превише) Примећујем да када устанем из седећег положаја, осећам вртоглавицу, али не нормално. Мислим да се можда знојим од соли и , наравно, пијем пуно воде током вежбања. Не предлажем да једете више соли. Оно што кажем је начин на који вам тело говори да је ваша сол исцрпљена је када се не осећате пуни у ногама и рукама. Мислим да је то у извесној мери тачно, јер тело ради више на концентрацији ствари него на апсолутним количинама. То није свеобухватна теорија јер постоје и друге ствари које могу повећати волумен крви, можда већ имате превише соли у крви итд. За записник, мој натријум у крви је увек близу доњег краја опсега, тако да ме моја грешка неће гурати изван опсега.<br/>Ок, шта је закључак? Да ли сада користим шејкер за сол или не? Предуго сам држао.<br/>Мислим да је овај чланак неодговоран у томе што сол апсолутно подиже бп код оних који имају осетљивост на сол. Ако поједем нешто веома слано, могу буквално ићи у хипертензивну кризу за сат времена.<br/>Ова врста осетљивости је уобичајена и да је не помињемо (јер се не уклапа у теорију аутора?) је опасна.<br/>@Јим портер: "јер се не уклапа у теорију аутора?" "Ауторска теорија" не постоји. То стварно није оно што ми овде радимо. Ово је чланак који једноставно пише о научним студијама на ту тему и говори оно што кажу, тако да не морате да просејавате кроз њих и сав медицински жаргон; ми то радимо за вас - у суштини оно о чему пишемо одражава тренутно стање људског знања о овој теми. Ако се у неком тренутку промени, ажурирамо чланак. У овом случају, међутим, најзначајније су два Цоцхранеова прегледа прилично убедљива: "Након више од 150 случајних клиничких испитивања и 13 популационих студија без и очигледног сигнала у корист смањења натријума, друга позиција би могла бити прихватити да такав сигнал можда не постоји." Постоје изузеци од сваког правила, и наизглед сте једно и то је веома интересантно ако је тако и било би занимљиво да сазнамо основни узрок. Али, опет, погледамо шта научне студије кажу и покушамо да то одразимо у ономе што пишемо. У суштини пишемо облик "светлосног читања" стила забавних истраживачких радова о темама, уместо да пишемо истраживачке радове.<br/>Нагласак на соли ће вас вероватно убити много пре него што ће сама сол. Урадите оно што вас чини срећним и вероватно ћете живети дуже него иначе; и чак и ако не, барем ћете уживати у времену које имате.<br/>Верујем да је проблем када се со помеша са мастима и ТО узрокује висок крвни притисак. На пример, неко је говорио о њиховом расту када једу чипс / чипс - то је зато што чипови садрже масноћу. Исто би важило и за помфрит или друга масна јела. Међутим, ако бисте посули сол на нешто попут воћа, то не би имало исти ефекат и не би подигло крвни притисак.<br/>Мислим да натријум добија лош реп и неки људи заправо конзумирају премало. Мислим да је сол са воћем или салатама у реду, али проблем је комбинација соли и масти и ако размислите о томе, то је место где људи обично добијају чипс од соли, помфрит, јако зачињено месо, у кремастим јелима итд.<br/>Особа која је написала овај чланак не додаје ништа вредно дискусији о високом крвном притиску, осим да охрабри људе да држе главе у песку.<br/>Борио сам се са високим крвним притиском око 12 година, јер ме је озбиљна несрећа проузроковала да будем физички неактиван око годину дана након несреће.<br/>Висок крвни притисак се може контролисати са и без лекова, а појединци различито реагују на различите третмане и постоје природни лекови за ову болест.<br/>Висок крвни притисак може изазвати мождани удар, хемораге мозга и допринети дијабетесу и болести бубрега.<br/>Равнотежа између калијума и натријума у нашој крви је веома критична и нажалост, већина лекара нема појма о ефекту који исхрана и правилна хидратација имају на ово стање.<br/>Већина лекара сам био само да дају рецепте који могу или не могу да раде.<br/>Постоје природне супстанце које су ми омогућиле да смањим крвни притисак у року од неколико дана од изузетно високог до готово нормалног, док ће лекари и фармацеути рећи да лекови (као што су Цозаар и Норвасц) могу потрајати до мјесец дана да раде.<br/>Открио сам да сок од једног лимуна са кором или етеричним уљем који се додаје у 16 унци минералне воде имао је значајне ефекте.<br/>Пиће овог једном или два пута дневно имало је веома значајан ефекат у мом случају; мој крвни притисак је отишао са 220/95 на 130/90 у року од 3 дана.<br/>Бели лук (дезодорисан) такође помаже, а воћни или поврћни сокови са смањеним садржајем соли и високим садржајем калијума такође помажу. (В-8 ниска сол или В-8 зелена).<br/>Ово није размишљање о жељама; то има везе са хемијом; то не значи да ће сви једнако одговорити на ове третмане, али се јако не слажем када неко каже да сол нема ефекта на крвни притисак.<br/>Ово ми се чини неодговорним и витешким, осим ако, наравно, не радите за једног од произвођача соли.<br/>Сол је неопходна и већина кухињских соли има јод у њима, што је есенцијална хранљива материја за људе.<br/>Пиће довољне количине чисте воде је такође веома важно; нешто што моји лекари никада нису поменули.<br/>Ово омогућава телу да се ослободи вишка соли и помаже телу да се очисти.<br/>Постоје многе природне супстанце и неке намирнице (као што је песто) које могу помоћи у смањењу крвног притиска и можете наћи многе постове на интернету о њима.<br/>Веб Мд и Тхе Маио Цлиниц имају постове на ову тему и верујем им много више од аутора овог поста.<br/>Чини ми се да је ово вежба у одбрани неодбрањивог.<br/>Због чега?<br/>Ко је био Хипократ и шта је, дођавола, знао?<br/>Имам изузетно низак крвни притисак. Ако устанем пребрзо, онесвестићу се на лицу. Мој доктор ми је рекао да једем онолико соли колико желим, без бриге.<br/>У сваком случају, ја ћу узети све ове савете са прстохватом ... знате шта. ;-Д<br/>Једем пуно соли (и мислим на *ЛОТ *). Пре неколико година, након што сам се уморио од тога да ми се стално говори колико је то лоше, одлучио сам да га тестирам. Као докторат, знам како научно планирати тест, а током неколико мјесеци минимизирајући што је могуће више варијабли, тестирао сам свој крвни притисак док сам редовно уносио сол наспрам ниског уноса соли. Резултати су били прилично очекивани, иако неки људи / могу / бити мало нетолерантни на релативно висок ниво уноса соли, за мене уопште није било разлике. Вратио сам се да једем храну на начин на који волим (слано), и кажем свима који саветују против овога једноставно не знају о чему причају о ЛОЛ-у<br/>Ја сам 27 жена. Почела сам да имам висок крвни притисак док сам узимала Аццутане пре годину и по дана (Аццутане повећава акумулацију холестерола). Оно што сам искусио је било интензивно, мој пулс је био на 120бпм, био сам вртоглавица, руке су ми стегнуте у необичан облик канџе и пецкале су док нису изгубиле осећај. Мислио сам да заправо умирем. Речено ми је да је то само напад панике, али никада нисам имао никаквих стварних проблема са анксиозношћу. Дат ми је кисеоник цео сат када сам изненада почео да жудим за сољу. Замолио сам пријатеља да трчи у мцдоналдс и да ми донесе додатне слане помфрите. У року од неколико минута након што сам појео сву ту сол, мој крвни притисак се вратио у нормалу, руке су ми се вратиле и поново сам могао нормално ходати и дисати.<br/>Налазим да су ствари које га највише покрећу за мене недостатак сна, не једу ништа цијели дан, кукуруз, пшеница и хемијске соли као што је МСГ. Али морска сол и нормална кухињска сол не погоршавају ствари, већ их чине бољим! Уз то речено, увек сам имао резултате крвних тестова који показују висок ниво калијума. Може ли то некако бити укључено? Мој доктор само слегне раменима као узроковано мојом љубављу према кромпиру и цитрусном воћу лол<br/>Можда ће вам требати нови лекар са високим калијумом или хиперкалемијом може изазвати епизоде које описујете и Аццутане може изазвати хиперкалемију.<br/>Калијум и натријум су очигледно повезани јер ваше ћелије стално размењују ове ћелије у и из ћелија како би одржале веће интрацелуларне концентрације калијума.<br/>Кортизол који подиже са депривацијом сна, не једе и друге нагласке обрће овај процес концентрације калијума у ћелију, али је намењен повећању излучивања калијума, ћелијског уноса апсорпције натријума и задржавања натријума у бубрезима, можда нешто није у реду са овим процесом са калијумом који се не излучује.

Хвала вам на свим корисним коментарима на овом сајту. Можете видети све интелигентно написане постове од људи који су смањили свој висок крвни притисак ограничавањем соли. Ја сам један од ових људи. Мој крвни притисак пре годину дана био је у просеку 180/120 када није лијечен, а када је на 3 различита лијека, у просеку 140/90. Након што сам се осећао ужасно, било од нежељених ефеката лекова или од главобоља од високог крвног притиска, одлучио сам да променим исхрану. Резултати које сам постигао су запањујући. Крвни притисак је савршено нормалан, 120/80. Нема главобоље, или осећај као да ми је грло отечено, или осећај као да ми је глава била превише врућа.... Могао сам да наставим и наставим. Урадио сам то без скупих производа. Само сам, колико је то могуће данас у САД-у, јео непрерађену храну и избегавао све додате соли. Обратите пажњу, све "додате" соли. Као што су многи исправно истакли, со је неопходна за људски живот. И многе намирнице природно садрже сву сол која нам је потребна, тако да није потребно додати. Слушајући ове претпостављене стручњаке, питам се како су људи икада преживели пре 10.000 година ако нису били довољно срећни да пронађу блок соли за лизање сваки дан! Прочитао сам један коментар о некоме ко је имао добре резултате из "сока једног лимуна са кором или етеричним уљем додатим у 16 унци минералне воде". Изазвао бих њега и друге да само пробају сок од лимуна са водом. Откривам да ако се очистим само једном недељно са једном чашом лимунске воде, имао је сјајан ефекат на моје здравље. Остали састојци могу помоћи, али то би био занимљив експеримент за вас. Тако да сам, као, многи, многи други, осетљив на сол. Можда неки људи могу да једу огромну количину соли на редовној основи без штетних здравствених ефеката. То није тачно за многе од нас, а увредљиво је када такозвани "професионалци" или "научници" оспоравају ово. Једна ствар коју увек кажем својим пацијентима, "Када је у питању ваше здравље, верујте себи изнад свих осталих". Ако сте уверени да одређени лек чини да се осећате болесно, а ваш лекар или фармацеут имплицира да је све у вашој глави, верујте себи, а не њима. Ако се, попут мене, осећате хиљаду пута боље када ограничите потрошњу соли или прерађене хране, онда молим вас, наставите да радите оно што радите и не слушајте оне који сугеришу другачије! Бићете здравији и срећнији. Хвала вам што сте ме саслушали, пријатељи моји издалека.<br/>Иако је свакако могуће да сте осетљиви на сол, када сте одлучили да промените своју исхрану, променили сте многе друге ствари поред тога колико соли сте јели. Два од најлакших начина за смањење крвног притиска без промене соли су 1. изгубити тежину. 2. једу више поврћа и воћа (ака храна богата калијумом). Бројне клиничке и опсервационе студије су показале да је однос натријума и калијума вероватно важнији од тога колико натријума једете. [Имајте на уму да се ово односи само на 99,999999% човечанства које једе између 3к и 6к мг натријума дневно. Сол је вероватно проблем ако једете из нормалног опсега, као што је 12,000мг + натријума дневно.]<br/>Хтео сам у основи да кажем исту ствар. Имао сам висок крвни притисак... Урадио сам КСНУМКС дан Палео Цхалленге... Све чисто од земаљске хране. Заправо сам повећао унос соли увођењем пуно слане говедине и киселе хране у моју исхрану за грицкање. Не само да је мој крвни притисак завршио скоро савршено ... Такође сам изгубио 16 килограма. Нисам био чак ни неко кога бисте заиста сматрали прекомерном тежином за почетак са ... 178 лбс до 162 лбс за 30 дана. Моје чудне главобоље су нестале... цео девет метара који долазе са високим крвним притиском. Уверен сам да со и крвни притисак нису повезани... и мислим да је то полицајац за људе који заиста треба да се на стварно здравој исхрани.<br/>Овај чланак је опасан и може убедити некога да користи сву сол коју жели. Али све што треба да урадим је да једем неколико великих врећа чипса и добијам 180/90 у року од неколико дана, останите ван соли онда 3-4 дана и добро хидратизујте, вратите се на 130/70. Сада "можда" сам преосетљив, али пошто се ово поновило пола туцета пута, избегавам сол. У нормалној храни има доста /<br/>Изгледа да не знате о чему говорите ... прочитајте Цурт Ницол ДД др унос испод. и поново прочитајте овај чланак ... били сте пристрасни због изложености лекарима који су пристрасни годинама и годинама свих иада..иада..иада ... поново прочитајте чланак. Наравно, нећете почети да једете сол за фунту ... све би ионако имало ужасан укус.<br/>Оно што је опасно су савети и третмани без научне основе засноване само на хипотези, споредни ефекат смањења већине људи редовног уноса соли је конзумирање мање обрађене хране која садржи огромне количине рафинисаних или једноставних угљених хидрата, високо оксидационих склоних уља, денатурисаних супстанци, загађивача и адитива.<br/>Смањење ових ће довести до побољшања укупне исхране.<br/>Ограничавање соли само по себи без других варијабли ће показати мало или нимало ефекта код већине људи и може бити штетно за друге.<br/>Ја сам. Унео сам детаљан коментар заустављања и почетка тестова који су КСНУМКС% доказали моју хипотезу да је На један од великих доприноса крвном притиску. Узима напор да документује и снима методе и резултат. Мој је био висок као КСНУМКС / КСНУМКС. Спустио сам га на конзистентан КСНУМКС / КСНУМКС за две године. Мој рад је документован у овом одељку за коментаре, али се тек треба појавити.<br/>Многи људи овде кажу да једе врећу чипса повећава њихов крвни притисак. Зар не схватају да то није здрава храна? Да ли мисле да можда не садржи све погрешне ствари?<br/>Мора постојати нека друга храна са високим садржајем натријума коју могу користити да покажу како сол утиче на њихов крвни притисак.<br/>Тако је... оно што је лоше је уље и маст која иде цеви и ограничава их... плус чипс од кромпира, све је скроб, који се претвара у шећер, а затим масти ...<br/>Не бих био довољно лаковеран да на тренутак помислим да сол није повезана са високим крвним притиском и повећаном телесном температуром, јер свакако јесте. Смањио сам свој крвни притисак 160 преко 80 на 119 преко 81 за неколико недеља тако што сам озбиљно смањио унос соли. Зашто је сваки пут кад поједем неколико порција чипса од кромпира, или једем помфрит Мц Доналд, одмах се суочим са руменилом и грозницом? Чак сам осетио и чуо, да, сужене вене у мојој глави, након што сам имао висок крвни притисак, проширио сам се, проширио и поново отворио, након што сам пио чаше и чаше воде, са нестанком грознице, нестанком нелагодности или загушења главе и смањеним крвним притиском.<br/>Ово ме стварно мучи, а ја морам да признам да сам сада мало збуњен. Волим со и могу да конзумирам више у једном оброку него што би требало да конзумирате у једном дану. Никада се није чинило да утиче на мој Б.П.<br/>Затим, када је мој Б.П. почео да расте како сам старији, мој доктор је рекао да смањи соли. Тако да сам ... без стварног ефекта. Заправо сам примљен у болницу са озбиљном инфекцијом, само да бих открио да када сам отпуштен, држао сам се на исхрани са ниским садржајем натријума, иако је приликом пријема мој ниво натријума био опасно низак.<br/>Све ово ме је навело да верујем да су опасности од натријума само мит, барем за мене. Али онда се моја жена разболела. Њен б.п. је стално пратио јер је наставио да иде прениско. Некада су јој убризгавали "натријум" (слана вода верујем) и њен крвни притисак би се појавио скоро одмах. Ово је било интравенозно, међутим.<br/>Дакле, да ли је то да нисам осетљив на сол, или је то нешто о стомаку који делује с баријера (тако да вас унос соли не утиче), док ће ИВ сол?<br/>За нешто што је тако фундаментално у медицинском савету, то је тако фрустрирајуће да се чини да је тако мало истраживања, барем квалитетно истраживање урађено на њему.<br/>Насупрот томе, на каснијем пријему у болницу, поново су ме имали на ниском натријуму (једном и идиот га ставља на своје медицинске податке, чини се немогућим да се то извуче ...) и дао ми лекове за смањење крвног притиска. Мој Б.П. је пао кроз под и забрињавао их у једној фази.<br/>БП лекови нису доказани да побољшају резултате или да буду безбедни у већини ситуација. Савремена медицина је прилично опасна да стално убијају људе са оним што прописују.<br/>Ваша супруга може имати проблема са бубрезима и надбубрежним жлездама, док је већа вероватноћа да имате васкуларне проблеме. Размислите о могућим узроцима животне средине, пијете воду са флуоридом који повећава апсорпцију олова, недостатак антиоксиданата као што је ала, вит а / е / ц / д / к2 може довести до повећања оксидативног стреса артеријске склерозе и калцификације артерија које ограничавају способност везила да дијалатирају, повећана иритација доводи до вагности витамина и коа повећаним ослоном ослоном ослозу.<br/>Ове ствари могу изазвати проблеме било где.<br/>Управо сам провео сат времена пишући коментар. Мој доктор жели да га види. Не појављујем се. Шта се дешава? Да ли сам губио време? Молим вас, одговорите.<br/>Одличан чланак. Чланци овог типа извлаче здравствене лудаке и знају све ... само погледајте коментаре. Ово ме такође подсећа на "глобално загревање". "климатске промене" (или како год да их називају ове недеље) "стручњаци" који га проповедају као да је то еванђеље када и они немају коначан доказ. |
| Nomadic Kirghiz. Golodnaia Steppe.<br/>This remarkable photograph shows a nomadic Kyrgyz family resting in the steppe grasslands. The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group widely spread over the area of eastern Turkestan. The man, with weathered face, is dressed in a skullcap and a frayed traditional striped coat. He is burdened with padded blankets and probably a small tent. The woman, with brilliant white turban, wears a tattered cloak and carries smaller bundles of blankets and clothes. Their small boy wears a colorful skullcap and a sparkling green silk jacket in the Chinese style. To the left is a desert thorn bush. The image is by Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863–1944), who used a special color photography process to create a visual record of the Russian Empire in the early 20th century. Some of Prokudin-Gorskii’s photographs date from about 1905, but the bulk of his work is from between 1909 and 1915, when, with the support of Tsar Nicholas II and the Ministry of Transportation, he undertook extended trips through many different parts of the empire. In 1911 he made two trips to an area of Central Asia then known as Turkestan (present-day Uzbekistan and neighboring states), where he photographed Islamic architectural monuments as well as Russian development projects, such as an irrigation scheme to make Golodnaia Steppe (“Hungry Steppe”) a productive area for raising cotton and wheat.<br/>Photo: Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.<br/>- acku Afghanistan<br/>- Image Size<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>- Contained in galleries | Номадски киргиски.

| Prescribed burning is a tool used in native landscapes and commercial timberlands across the world. There are many reasons why a land manager might use prescribed burning to enhance or manage the land.<br/>One of the most beneficial results of prescribed burning, regardless of the intended end goal, is the reduction of fuel loads in the case a wildfire breaks out. Wildfires can be devastating for urban and rural communities across the country. In 2020, one of the worst most recent wildfire seasons in the United States, nearly 18,000 structures were lost to out-of-control fires, over half of those being homes. In the last decade, it has cost between $1.5 billion and $3 billion dollars each year for federal wildfire suppression tactics, including equipment and personnel.<br/>The top 10 most destructive fires by financial losses have occurred in California, with the largest being the 2018 Camp Fire, which incurred over $10.4 billion in expenses for those affected. Wildfires aren’t just financially impactful, they can cause major environmental damage and be a nuisance to general human activities.<br/>Of course, raging fires burning in the area means that road closures are likely, which impacts travel. In addition, smoke generated by wildfires can have strong effects on communities even hundreds of miles away as it is carried in the atmosphere. This can drop ash and particulate matter and impacts air quality, making it difficult for many to be outside. Communication can be impacted if fires approach telephone lines, cellphone towers, or even energy distribution centers.<br/>You can see why minimizing wildfires would result in a reduction to impacts to human activity.<br/>Environmental damage can be significant since wildfires often burn large swaths of lands, are high intensity, and have severe impacts. In 2020, nearly 60,000 fires in the United States, impacting over 10 million acres on the east and west coast. Typically more fires in the eastern states, but these fires are smaller in size and generally are less severe. Western states see marginally fewer fires than the East, but the western fires can be more intense and consume more acreage at once. This regional difference is generally seen because of the landscapes, the types of plants and fuel available to burn, as well as weather differences, particularly drought conditions. Wildfires impact plant communities and wildlife in the area, and overall have a negative influence on the environment.<br/>It may seem weird to fight fire with fire, but there are “good fires” and “bad fires.” Prescribed burning are like a prescription written by a doctor — the “doctor” in this case being the land manager. The prescription details what the goals of the burn are, the weather conditions when the burn should be conducted for the best results and least human impact, and the intensity of the fire to achieve the results.<br/>This prescription means that the fire will occur in a safe, controlled way with little impact on the environment or humans.<br/>Prescribed fire does more than just prevent raging wildfires, it can also benefit native landscapes, improve food sources and habitat for wildlife, or control underbrush in timber stands. Many native plants across the world are designed for fire to occur, since fires would naturally occur long before human intervention. Some plants need fire for their seed pods to open, some need other plants to be cleared out by fire so their seeds can germinate and succeed, while others are designed to withstand fire with thick, insulating bark or waxy foliage.<br/>Prescribed burners can tell you many stories of deer, turkey, quail, and other wildlife coming in immediately after a fire to consume plants and insects. Wildlife also benefit from improved nutrition in plants and better habitats in areas regenerating after a fire.<br/>Prescribed fire might be a beneficial tool for your land too. Reach out to your local forest service or prescribed burn association to see how prescribed burning might be implemented on your property. This important resource is vital to protect and encourage with the way we vote, so make sure those in office know this issue matters to you.<br/>Michelle Miller, the “Farm Babe,” is an internationally recognized keynote speaker, writer, and social media influencer and travels full time to advocate for agriculture.

Постоји много разлога зашто би менаџер земљишта могао користити прописано спаљивање како би побољшао или управљао земљиштем.<br/>Један од најкориснијих резултата прописаног спаљивања, без обзира на намеру крајњег циља, је смањење оптерећења горивом у случају избијања шумског пожара. Шумски пожари могу бити разорни за урбане и руралне заједнице широм земље. У 2020. години, једној од најгорих скорашњих сезона шумских пожара у Сједињеним Државама, скоро 18.000 објеката је изгубљено у пожарима који су ван контроле, а више од половине њих су домови. У последњој деценији, то је коштало између 1,5 милијарди и 3 милијарде долара годишње за федералне тактике сузбијања шумских пожара, укључујући опрему и особље.<br/>Топ 10 најразорнијих пожара због финансијских губитака догодило се у Калифорнији, а највећи је био пожар у кампу 2018. године, који је имао више од 10,4 милијарде долара трошкова за оне који су погођени. Шумски пожари нису само финансијски утицајни, они могу проузроковати велику штету животној средини и бити узнемирујући за опште људске активности.<br/>Наравно, бесни пожари који гори у том подручју значи да су вјероватно затварање путева, што утиче на путовања. Поред тога, дим који стварају шумски пожари може имати јаке ефекте на заједнице чак и стотинама миља далеко док се носи у атмосфери. Ово може да падне пепео и честице материје и утиче на квалитет ваздуха, што отежава за многе да буду напољу. Комуникација може бити под утицајем ако пожари приступе телефонске линије, мобилне телефоне куле, или чак дистрибутивне центре за енергију.<br/>Можете видети зашто би минимизирање шумских пожара резултирало смањењем утицаја на људску активност.<br/>Штета по животну средину може бити значајна јер шумски пожари често спаљују велике површине земљишта, имају висок интензитет и имају озбиљне утицаје. У 2020. години скоро 60.000 пожара у Сједињеним Државама, утичући на више од 10 милиона хектара на источној и западној обали. Типично више пожара у источним државама, али ови пожари су мањи по величини и генерално су мање озбиљни. Западне државе виде маргинално мање пожара од Истока, али западни пожари могу бити интензивнији и троше више површине одједном. Ова регионална разлика се генерално види због пејзажа, врста биљака и горива доступних за спаљивање, као и временских разлика, посебно услова суше. Шумски пожари утичу на биљне заједнице и дивље животиње у том подручју, а свеукупно имају негативан утицај на животну средину.<br/>Може изгледати чудно да се бори ватру са ватром, али постоје "добра ватра" и "лоше ватре." Прописано спаљивање су као рецепт који је написао лекар - "доктор" у овом случају је менаџер земљишта. Рецепт детаљно описује циљеве опекотина, временске услове када се опекотина треба спровести за најбоље резултате и најмањи људски утицај, као и интензитет пожара за постизање резултата.<br/>Овај рецепт значи да ће се пожар догодити на сигуран, контролисан начин са малим утицајем на животну средину или људе.<br/>Прописана ватра чини више него само спречавање бесних шумских пожара, она такође може имати користи од аутохтоних пејзажа, побољшати изворе хране и станиште за дивље животиње или контролисати подчетку у дрвеним штандовима. Многе аутохтоне биљке широм света су дизајниране за пожар, јер би се пожари природно догодили много пре људске интервенције. Неким биљкама је потребна ватра да би се отвориле њихове махуне семена, некима је потребно да друге биљке буду очишћене ватром како би њихове семе могле да клијају и успеју, док су друге дизајниране да издрже ватру са густом, изолационом кором или воштаним лишћем.<br/>Прописани горионици могу вам испричати многе приче о јелену, ћурети, препелици и другим дивљим животињама које долазе одмах након пожара како би конзумирале биљке и инсекте. Дивље животиње такође имају користи од побољшане исхране биљака и бољих станишта у подручјима која се регенеришу након пожара.<br/>Прописана ватра може бити корисна алатка и за ваше земљиште. Обратите се локалној шумарској служби или прописаном спаљивању да бисте видели како се прописано спаљивање може имплементирати на вашој имовини.

| The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I – Book Review<br/>The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I: Battalion Histories Based on Official Documents. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 pages, photographs, maps. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>The Fourth Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, was one of the more famous combat units in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. Consisting of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion (Marine), the Fourth Brigade went through five main battles: Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont, and the closing days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.<br/>Clark, a former Marine and an author with many historical Marine Corps books to his credit, based this history largely upon official records. The book is not footnoted until Chapter 3, and then it is only sparsely footnoted. Thus, in most cases, we cannot know precisely where a given quote or information comes from. While we may assume that an operations report or field message is the origin of some data, there is nothing to tell us where we may find that information. Quotes, including entire block quotations, are left un-footnoted with no indication as to the origin of the material. Probably most of the information comes from the ten-volume Records of the Second Division, listed in the bibliography, which is grist for the Marine Corps enthusiast’s mill.<br/>The book is divided into eight chapters; the first chapter gives an overview of the Fourth Brigade’s history as a whole. Each of the rest of the chapters covers one of the battalions of the brigade, plus the brigade’s machine gun battalion. Each chapter is in turn arranged chronologically in a style reminiscent of a diary or log, with narrative falling under a given day or range of days. This arrangement makes for a disjointed overall history of the brigade; it is difficult to get the feel of how the battalions fit into the division’s role during a battle. The narrative falls into recording what seem like disjointed events without the benefit of broader context. Furthermore, the battalion/chapter arrangement ensures an amount of repetition because the same background must be repeated for each battalion, and each battle is “fought” seven times. There are many fine photographs included, and the maps are adequate, although I would prefer more maps with greater detail. Surprisingly, neither the photographs nor the maps are credited.<br/>With all that being said, it should be recognized that the author, an expert on this subject, has made an important effort to document the history of this brigade. The original sources, field messages in particular, capture the confusion and flavor of combat as experienced by the junior officers in the brigade. Historians interested in the Fourth Brigade are fortunate to have available an abundance of its field messages (or at least copies thereof). Readers who are not familiar with these messages will find those quoted in the book to be an enlightening window on the world of AEF combat.<br/>Likewise, there are some interesting tidbits to be gleaned from the extensive array of operations reports included. One example, which illustrated how the AEF learned “on the fly,” is a report written by Lt. Col. Frederick M. Wise, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, after fighting at Belleau Wood. Wise’s enumeration of twenty-three lessons learned is quoted in full and provides some interesting reading. What also comes through in these messages and reports is that, especially in the early battles, command and control issues plagued even the vaunted Marines. Platoons and companies became lost and diverged from their intended path as battalion commanders anxiously sought information via runners. It’s also interesting to see the degree of involvement at Belleau Wood by the brigade commander, Brigadier General James G. Harbord (US Army). Harbord wasn’t shy about sending messages directly to battalion and even company commanders, bypassing regimental commanders.<br/>Despite the issues and troubles, which were common to all units fighting in World War I, the 2nd Division succeeded in making an enviable record (although, it must be said, at a great cost in casualties). Most historians agree that it was one of the two best divisions in the AEF (the other being the First Division), and the Fourth Brigade did its part to earn that reputation. The success of the brigade can in part be attributed to the personal heroism of its officers and men. The author, probably using award citations or recommendations, has carefully recorded the heroic feats of individual Marines, soldiers, and Navy corpsmen; this is a valuable contribution to the history of the brigade and a fine tribute to brave men.<br/>This book will appeal to readers who are interested in the Marine Corps. For those who are not familiar with the 2nd Division, it might be helpful to first read a history of that division (for example, The Battery Press’s 1989 reprint of The Second Division, American Expeditionary Force in France, 1917-1919). That history, although a bit dry in places, will help put the action described in Clark’s book in context.<br/>Peter L. Belmonte is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and freelance historian. A veteran of Operation Desert Storm, he has written extensively on immigration and military history, and his current studies focus on the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. His most recent book, Days of Perfect Hell: The 26th U.S. Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, October-November, 1918, will be released by Schiffer Books in October. | Четврта бригада маринаца у Првом светском рату - преглед књиге<br/>Четврта бригада маринаца у Првом светском рату: Историје батаљона на основу званичних докумената. Џорџ Б. Кларк. МцФарланд, 2015. 288 страна, фотографије, мапе. Мека. $ 39.95.<br/>Четврта бригада, део 2. дивизије, била је једна од најпознатијих борбених јединица у Америчким експедиционим снагама (АЕФ) Великог рата. Састојећи се од 5. и 6. пука маринаца и 6. батаљона митраљеза, Четврта бригада је прошла кроз пет главних битака: Бело Вуд, Соасон, Сен Мијел, Блан Мон и завршне дане офанзиве Меза-Аргон.<br/>Кларк, бивши маринац и аутор са многим историјским књигама Марине Цорпса на његову заслугу, заснива ову историју углавном на званичним записима. Књига није фуснота све до поглавља 3, а онда је само ретко фуснота. Стога, у већини случајева, не можемо тачно знати одакле долази одређени цитат или информација. Иако можемо претпоставити да је извјештај о операцијама или пољска порука порекло неких података, не постоји ништа што би нам могло рећи гдје можемо пронаћи те информације. Цитати, укључујући читаве блок цитате, су остављени без напомена без индикације о пореклу материјала. Вероватно већина информација долази из десетотомних записа Друге дивизије, наведених у библиографији, која је намењена за млин ентузијаста маринског корпуса.<br/>Књига је подељена у осам поглавља; прво поглавље даје преглед историје Четврте бригаде у целини. Свако од осталих поглавља покрива један од батаљона бригаде, плус митраљески батаљон бригаде. Свако поглавље је заузврат хронолошки распоређено у стилу који подсећа на дневник или дневник, са наративом који пада под одређени дан или опсег дана. Овај аранжман чини неодвојиву укупну историју бригаде; тешко је добити осећај како се батаљони уклапају у улогу дивизије током битке. Наратив пада у снимање онога што изгледа као раздвојени догађаји без користи од ширег контекста. Штавише, аранжман батаљона / поглавља обезбеђује количину понављања јер иста позадина мора бити поновљена за сваки батаљон, а свака битка се "бори" седам пута. Укључено је много финих фотографија, а мапе су адекватне, иако бих више волео мапе са више детаља. Изненађујуће, ни фотографије ни мапе се не кредитирају.<br/>Уз све то, треба признати да је аутор, стручњак за ову тему, уложио важан напор да документује историју ове бригаде. Оригинални извори, посебно поруке на терену, обухватају конфузију и укус борбе коју су искусили млађи официри у бригади. Историчари заинтересовани за Четврту бригаду су срећни што имају обиље својих теренских порука (или барем њихових копија). Читаоци који нису упознати са овим порукама наћи ће оне наведене у књизи као просветљавајући прозор у свет АЕФ борбе.<br/>Исто тако, постоје неке занимљиве тидбитс које треба прикупити из широког спектра укључених извјештаја о операцијама. Један пример, који је илустровао како је АЕФ научио "у лету", је извештај који је написао потпуковник Фредерик М. Вајз, командант 2. батаљона 5. маринаца, након борбе код Бело шуме. Мудро набрајање двадесет и три лекције научене је цитиран у потпуности и пружа неке занимљиве читање. Оно што такође пролази кроз ове поруке и извештаје је да су, посебно у раним биткама, питања команде и контроле мучила чак и прослављене маринаце. Водови и чете су се изгубили и одступили од свог намераваног пута, јер су команданти батаљона нестрпљиво тражили информације преко тркача. Такође је занимљиво видети степен учешћа у Беллеау Вуд од стране команданта бригаде, бригадног генерала Џејмса Г. Харборда (Америчка војска). Харборд се није стидео да шаље поруке директно командантима батаљона, па чак и четама, заобилазећи команданте пукова.<br/>Упркос проблемима и проблемима, који су били заједнички свим јединицама које су се бориле у Првом светском рату, 2. дивизија је успела да направи завидан рекорд (иако, мора се рећи, уз велику цену жртава). Већина историчара се слаже да је то била једна од две најбоље дивизије у АЕФ-у (друга је била Прва дивизија), а Четврта бригада је учинила свој део да стекне ту репутацију. Успех бригаде делимично се може приписати личном херојству њених официра и људи. Аутор је, вероватно користећи наградне цитате или препоруке, пажљиво забиљежио херојске подвиге појединачних маринаца, војника и морнарица; ово је вриједан допринос историји бригаде и фина почаст храбрим људима.<br/>Ова књига ће апеловати на читаоце који су заинтересовани за Марине Цорпс. За оне који нису упознати са 2. дивизијом, можда би било корисно прво прочитати историју те дивизије (на пример, The Battery Press' 1989 репринт Друге дивизије, Америчке експедиционе снаге у Француској, 1917-1919). Та историја, иако мало сува на местима, помоћи ће да се акција описана у Кларковој књизи стави у контекст.<br/>Питер Белмонте је пензионисани официр америчког ваздухопловства и слободни историчар. Ветеран операције Пустињска олуја, он је обимно писао о имиграцији и војној историји, а његове тренутне студије се фокусирају на америчке експедиционе снаге у Првом светском рату.
