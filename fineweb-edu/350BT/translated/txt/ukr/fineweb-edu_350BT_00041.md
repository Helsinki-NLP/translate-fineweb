| The workplace can be a complex environment, with numerous laws and regulations that govern the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers. In Canada, the legal framework that governs employment relationships is known as status law. Status law covers a wide range of issues, from hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety. Understanding these laws is critical for employees, who can use this information to protect their rights and advocate for themselves in the workplace. This guide will provide a brief overview of some of the most common law cases in Canada.<br/>Hiring and Termination:<br/>One of the most important aspects of status law is the hiring process. Employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws and ensure that they do not make hiring decisions based on factors such as race, gender, age, or religion. Once an employee has been hired, the employer is also required to follow specific procedures if they decide to terminate the employee. By Law includes providing the employee with adequate notice, or paying them severance if the termination is without cause. best employment lawyer Toronto can advise about it.<br/>Discrimination and Harassment:<br/>Another critical aspect of status law is protecting employees from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfairly based on a personal characteristic, such as race, gender, age, or religion. Harassment is any behavior that creates a hostile or offensive working environment. In both cases, employees have the right to file a complaint with their employer or with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.<br/>Wages and Hours of Work:<br/>Status law also regulates the wages and hours of work for employees. Employers must comply with minimum wage laws and ensure that employees receive the appropriate overtime pay for any hours worked over the standard workweek. In addition, employers must provide employees with breaks and time off for holidays, vacations, and sick leave.<br/>Finally, status law requires employers to maintain a safe working environment for their employees. This includes providing adequate training, equipment, and safety protocols to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. Employees have the right to refuse work if they believe it is unsafe, and employers must investigate and address any safety concerns raised by employees and represented by the best employment lawyer in Toronto.<br/>In conclusion, understanding the common cases in Canadian status law is essential for employees to navigate the workplace and protect their rights. From hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety, employees need to be aware of the laws that govern their employment relationship. If employees have any questions or concerns, they can seek advice from a lawyer or consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. By knowing their rights and responsibilities, employees can ensure a fair and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues. | Робоче місце може бути складним середовищем, з численними законами та правилами, які регулюють права та обов'язки працівників та роботодавців. У Канаді правова база, яка регулює трудові відносини, відома як статус-закон. Статусне право охоплює широкий спектр питань, від найму та звільнення до дискримінації та безпеки на робочому місці. Розуміння цих законів має вирішальне значення для співробітників, які можуть використовувати цю інформацію для захисту своїх прав і захищати себе на робочому місці. Це керівництво надасть короткий огляд деяких з найбільш поширених випадків права в Канаді.<br/>Найм і припинення:<br/>Одним з найважливіших аспектів статусу закону є процес найму. Роботодавці повинні дотримуватися антидискримінаційних законів і гарантувати, що вони не приймають рішення про найм на основі таких факторів, як раса, стать, вік або релігія. Після того, як працівник був найнятий, роботодавець також зобов'язаний дотримуватися конкретних процедур, якщо вони вирішать припинити працівника. За законом включає в себе надання працівнику відповідного повідомлення, або сплати їм вихідного виходу, якщо припинення без причини. Кращий юрист з працевлаштування Торонто може порадити про це.<br/>Дискримінація та переслідування:<br/>Ще одним критичним аспектом статусу закону є захист працівників від дискримінації та домагань на робочому місці. Дискримінація відбувається, коли до працівника ставляться несправедливо на основі особистих характеристик, таких як раса, стать, вік або релігія. Загартування - це будь-яка поведінка, яка створює вороже або образливе робоче середовище. В обох випадках працівники мають право подати скаргу своєму роботодавцю або в Канадську комісію з прав людини.<br/>Заробітна плата та робочий час:<br/>Закон про статус також регулює заробітну плату та робочий час для працівників. Роботодавці повинні дотримуватися законів про мінімальну заробітну плату та забезпечити, щоб працівники отримували відповідну оплату понаднормового часу за будь-які години, відпрацьовані протягом стандартного робочого тижня. Крім того, роботодавці повинні надавати працівникам перерви та відпустки на свята, відпустки та відпустку по хворобі.<br/>Нарешті, закон про статус вимагає від роботодавців підтримувати безпечне робоче середовище для своїх співробітників. Це включає в себе забезпечення належної підготовки, обладнання та протоколи безпеки для запобігання нещасних випадків на робочому місці та травм. Працівники мають право відмовитися від роботи, якщо вони вважають, що це небезпечно, і роботодавці повинні розслідувати і вирішувати будь-які проблеми з безпекою, підняті працівниками і представлені кращим адвокатом з працевлаштування в Торонто.<br/>На закінчення, розуміння поширених випадків у канадському законі про статус має важливе значення для працівників, щоб орієнтуватися на робочому місці та захищати свої права. Від найму та звільнення до дискримінації та безпеки на робочому місці працівники повинні знати закони, які регулюють їх трудові відносини. Якщо у співробітників виникнуть будь-які питання або проблеми, вони можуть звернутися за порадою до адвоката або проконсультуватися з Канадською комісією з прав людини. Знаючи свої права та обов'язки, працівники можуть забезпечити справедливе та безпечне робоче середовище для себе та своїх колег. |
| There's an old adage in the auto industry that says your vehicle loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot. The computer and technology industry is not so different, in that new parts and systems are constantly pushing the envelope of performance and value, making it impossible to have a top-of-the-line system for very long. The purpose of this paper is to step back in time 10 years and examine the technology landscape then to see how it compares to today's technologies we know and love.<br/>Much has been written, and much is still debated about the technology axiom called; Moore's Law. Some people interpret the law to mean a doubling of computer power every 18 months to 2 years, while others maintain it means a doubling of the numbers of transistors (microscopic on / off switches if you will) engineers are able to print into the same amount of silicon. In fact Moore stated that transistor counts would double every year, which he later adjusted to be every 2 years) Regardless, this trend of performance and transistor growth has held true for over 40 years.<br/>More recently, Moore's law has been applied to graphics processing units (GPUs) as well. The GPU is actually not even 10 years old at the time of writing. The official term GPU was coined with the nVidia GeForce 256 series of 3D cards. Released in August 1999, this was the first chip that was able to compute vertex transformations and pixel lighting in hardware. Since its release, graphics processing power has followed a similar trend of doubling performance every 18 months to 2 years. This article is not a technical document, rather a glimpse into the past 10 years ago to give you an idea of how far we've come in such a short time.<br/>A Little History About the Author:<br/>The year was 1999. It was my sophomore / junior year in high school. Now I'll pause so that 90% of the readers who grow up in the 70s and 80's can turn up their nose and stop reading.<br/>Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's continue.<br/>I am an internet child. I got into computers, and all manner of electronic geekery just as the Internet was becoming something that "just might catch on". My high school was not quite on the boring edge of technology as it was, but we were one of the first public schools in my area to be equipped with a full T1 line and the 1.5Mbps of awesome dedicated bandwidth that it piped through the network . Our network was built from a hodge-podge mixture of nice PC computers labs (mostly K6 200MHz / Win 95 machines), and a network engineers nightmare concoction of Macintoshes; LC II's up through new G3 iMacs.<br/>In 1999 I was still rocking a 486 DX-33 PC with 8MB of ram and Windows 3.11 as my PC at home, while my parents had a nice Pentium 100 Windows 95 machine my siblings and I would fight for time on. So what was the point of those last couple paragraphs you're probably asking? Well, that is where I was, and what I was using 10 years ago in computing, and hopefully it got you thinking back a decade to what you were computing on.<br/>10 years ago today, The computer world was working itself into a frenzy, getting ready for the near future release of the brand new Intel Pentium III Processor. The best money could do was a Pentium II processor at 450MHz with PC100 Memory. Rival AMD was doing alright for itself peddling its budget conscious K6-2 series of processors. Your average computer cost around $ 2000- $ 2500 at this time for a PC with a solid Pentium II processor. The Pentium III was due to be released on February 26th, and was the subject of a wicked debate over the merits of its built in unique ID number. Also noteworthy was its inclusion of the first SSE instruction set (The modern Core i7 processor is at SSE4 +). However without software designed to make use of the new instructions the processor was not much faster than an equivalent clocked Pentium II CPU and took quite a bit of heat from the press.<br/>On the graphics front the war between nVidia and 3DFx was raging. nVidia, a relative newcomer to the field, was riding high on top of their very successful TNT (Twin-Texel) video processor, while 3DFx was fighting to retain its market leadership title with its Voodoo3 line of graphics cards. The Voodoo cards were excellent performers, however the TNT cards had the advantage of 32 bit color while the Voodoo's were stuck at 24 bits. ATI was around and kicking with their Rage series of 3D cards (especially popular as integrated chips in servers and workstations), however they never really entered into the hardcore 3D accelerator race until the Radeon line debuted in 2000.<br/>In 1999 the internet boom was just beginning and attracting massive amounts of attention and investment capital from all over the globe. The big business of the time was in the search and portal business. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and Lycos were perhaps the most recognizable and capable players in this industry. Google -say-wha? Other companies from other industries, such as television media, and ISPs were taking notice, and buying up internet portals right and left in an attempt to tap into the viral spread of the internet. New technologies like Java were coming into their own, and began to lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. Studies determined that by 1999 about half of US households had a computer, and most of the new computer purchases were being made to get online.<br/>PDA's were quickly becoming the new must have gadget. The Palm Pilot being the device that led the charge. I myself had a Palm IIIe toward the later half of 2000. Personal pagers were still hot sellers, but cell phones were getting smaller and more practical and affordable. Also a war was heating up in the computer memory segment. Samsung introduced new DDR memory chips that promised to double the effective bandwidth of existing memory chips in future setups, however Rambus was busy developing their own high speed RAM for use in high end Intel systems.<br/>This field is possibly a bit too large to cover here, but a brief OS recap: The PC world was running strong with windows 98, and anxiously awaiting the updated Windows 98 Second Edition due out in May 1999. The Macintosh crowd was plugging away happily on their Mac OS 8.5 Machines, while awaiting an update to OS 9 sometime later that year. Linux was also starting to come into its own, as big name vendors like IBM were starting to bundle distributions of Redhat, Caldera, and others with some servers.<br/>I'll admit this article was more for my amusement and reminiscing than anything else. I hope that somewhere in the course of this mass of words and broken sentences, you too had some good recollections of computer equipment past. It's good to remember the technologies we grow up with and we are fortunately enough to have the robust internet we are used to today to help conjure up images and technical specs of those glory days. Sites like the Tech Time Machine exist to help us relive those days, and have a few chuckles at equipment we thought we'd never use to its full potential. I remember touching a Pentium 200MMX machine for the first time and being in awe at its raw speed and seemingly infinite possibilities. Now I constantly get upset with the speed of my current 3GHz dual core Athlon X2 6000+ PC. I can not even imagine how many windows that Pentium 200 would have thrown out of today. It's a crazy world we live in. | В автоіндустрії є стара приказка, яка говорить, що ваш автомобіль втрачає цінність, як тільки ви його звідти. Комп'ютерна і технологічна індустрія не настільки різні, в тому, що нові частини і системи постійно просувають оболонку продуктивності і цінності, що робить неможливим мати сучасну систему дуже довго. Мета цієї статті - зробити крок назад у часі на 10 років і вивчити технологічний ландшафт, щоб побачити, як він порівнюється з сучасними технологіями, які ми знаємо і любимо.<br/>Багато було написано, і багато все ще обговорюється про аксіому технології під назвою; Закон Мура. Деякі люди інтерпретують закон як подвоєння потужності комп'ютера кожні 18 місяців до 2 років, в той час як інші стверджують, що це означає подвоєння кількості транзисторів (мікроскопічних включених / вимкнених вимикачів, якщо хочете) інженери можуть друкувати в тій же кількості кремнію. Фактично Мур заявив, що кількість транзисторів буде подвоюватися щороку, що пізніше він коригував, щоб бути кожні 2 роки) Незважаючи на це, ця тенденція продуктивності і зростання транзистора зберігається протягом більше 40 років.<br/>Зовсім недавно закон Мура був застосований і до графічних процесорів (GPU). GPU насправді навіть не 10 років на момент написання. Офіційний термін GPU був придуманий з серією 3D-карт nVidia GeForce 256. Випущений в серпні 1999 року, це був перший чіп, який зміг обчислити перетворення вершин і освітлення пікселів в апаратному забезпеченні. З моменту його випуску обчислювальна потужність графіки слідувала аналогічній тенденції подвоєння продуктивності кожні 18 місяців до 2 років. Ця стаття не є технічним документом, скоріше зазирнемо в минуле 10 років тому, щоб дати вам уявлення про те, як далеко ми пройшли за такий короткий час.<br/>Трохи історії про автора:<br/>Це був 1999 рік. Це був мій другий рік / молодший рік у середній школі. Тепер я зупинюся, щоб 90% читачів, які виростають у 70-х і 80-х роках, могли зайти в ніс і перестати читати.<br/>Гаразд, тепер, коли це не так, давайте продовжимо.<br/>Я інтернет-дитина. Я потрапила в комп'ютери, і всілякі електронні гікери так само, як Інтернет ставав чимось, що "просто може підхопити". Моя середня школа була не зовсім на нудному краю технології, як це було, але ми були одними з перших державних шкіл в моєму районі, щоб бути оснащені повним T1 лінія і 1,5 Мбіт / с приголомшливої виділеної пропускної здатності, що вона труби через мережу. Наша мережа була побудована з суміші гарних комп'ютерних лабораторій для ПК (в основному K6 200 МГц / Win 95 машин) і кошмарної суміші мережевих інженерів Macintoshes; LC II через нові G3 iMac.<br/>У 1999 році я все ще розгойдував ПК 486 DX-33 з 8 МБ та Windows 3.11 як мій комп'ютер вдома, в той час як мої батьки мали гарну машину Pentium 100 Windows 95 мої брати і сестри, і я б боровся за час. То в чому ж сенс тих останніх двох абзаців, про які ви, напевно, питаєте? Ось де я був, і що я використовував 10 років тому в обчислювальній техніці, і, сподіваюся, це змусило вас подумати про те, на чому ви обчислювали.<br/>10 років тому сьогодні, комп'ютерний світ працював себе в божевілля, готуючись до найближчого майбутнього випуску нового процесора Intel Pentium III. Найкращі гроші могли зробити процесор Pentium II на 450 МГц з пам'яттю PC100. Конкурент AMD робив все добре для себе, торгуючи своїми бюджетними серіями процесорів K6-2. Ваш середній комп'ютер коштував близько 2000 - 2500 доларів в цей час для ПК з твердим процесором Pentium II. Pentium III повинен був бути випущений 26 лютого, і був предметом злісних дебатів щодо достоїнств його вбудованого унікального ідентифікаційного номера. Також варто відзначити, що він включив перший набір інструкцій SSE (сучасний процесор Core i7 знаходиться на SSE4 +). Однак без програмного забезпечення, призначеного для використання нових інструкцій, процесор був не набагато швидше, ніж еквівалентний процесор з тактовою частотою Pentium II, і потребував досить багато тепла від преса.<br/>На графічному фронті війна між nVidia і 3DFx бушувала. nVidia, відносний новачок у цій галузі, їздив високо на вершині свого дуже успішного відеопроцесора TNT (Twin-Texel), в той час як 3DFx боровся за збереження свого лідерства на ринку з лінійкою відеокарт Voodoo3. Карти Voodoo були відмінними виконавцями, однак карти TNT мали перевагу 32-бітного кольору, в той час як карти Voodoo були застрягли на 24 бітах. ATI була навколо і штовхала зі своєю серією 3D-карт Rage (особливо популярними як інтегровані чіпи на серверах і робочих станціях), однак вони ніколи не вступали в хардкорну гонку 3D-прискорювачів, поки лінія Radeon не дебютувала в 2000 році.<br/>У 1999 році інтернет-бум тільки почався і привернув величезну кількість уваги та інвестиційного капіталу з усього світу. Великий бізнес того часу був у пошуку та портальному бізнесі. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite і Lycos були, мабуть, найбільш впізнаваними і здібними гравцями в цій галузі. Google -say-wha? Інші компанії з інших галузей, такі як телевізійні ЗМІ та інтернет-провайдери, звертали на це увагу та скуповували інтернет-портали праворуч та ліворуч, намагаючись підключитися до вірусного поширення Інтернету. Нові технології, такі як Java, почали закладати основу для Інтернету, яким ми його знаємо сьогодні. Дослідження встановили, що до 1999 року близько половини домогосподарств США мали комп'ютер, і більшість нових покупок комп'ютерів здійснювалися для виходу в Інтернет.<br/>КПК швидко ставали новими повинні мати гаджет. Palm Pilot є пристроєм, який керував зарядом. Я сам мав Palm IIIe до другої половини 2000 року. Особисті пейджери все ще були гарячими продавцями, але мобільні телефони ставали все меншими та більш практичними та доступними. Також війна нагрівалася в сегменті комп'ютерної пам'яті. Samsung представила нові чипи пам'яті DDR, які обіцяли подвоїти ефективну пропускну здатність існуючих чипів пам'яті в майбутніх налаштуваннях, однак Rambus була зайнята розробкою власної високошвидкісної оперативної пам'яті для використання в високопродуктивних системах Intel.<br/>Це поле, можливо, занадто велике, щоб охопити тут, але короткий огляд ОС: світ ПК був сильним з Windows 98 і з нетерпінням чекав оновленої Windows 98 Second Edition, яка повинна вийти в травні 1999 року. Натовп Macintosh щасливо підключався до своїх Mac OS 8.5 Machines, очікуючи оновлення до OS 9 пізніше в тому ж році. Linux також почав вступати в свої права, оскільки великі постачальники, такі як IBM, почали об'єднувати дистрибутиви Redhat, Caldera та інших з деякими серверами.<br/>Я визнаю, що ця стаття була більше для мого задоволення і спогадів, ніж все інше. Я сподіваюся, що десь в ході цієї маси слів і зламаних речень, ви теж мали деякі хороші спогади про комп'ютерне обладнання минулого. Добре пам'ятати про технології, з якими ми виростаємо, і ми, на щастя, достатньо надійний інтернет, до якого ми звикли сьогодні, щоб допомогти викликати зображення та технічні характеристики тих днів слави. Такі сайти, як Tech Time Machine, існують, щоб допомогти нам пережити ті дні, і мають кілька посмішок щодо обладнання, яке, як ми думали, ми ніколи не використаємо в повному обсязі. Я пам'ятаю, як вперше торкався машини Pentium 200MMX і був у захваті від її сирої швидкості та, здавалося б, нескінченних можливостей. Тепер я постійно засмучуюсь через швидкість мого поточного двоядерного ПК Athlon X2 6000 + 3GHz. Я навіть не можу собі уявити, скільки вікон викинуло б Pentium 200 з сьогоднішнього дня. Це божевільний світ, в якому ми живемо. |
| The cultural anthropology major and minor offer a holistic understanding of human diversity. By exploring, analyzing, and understanding patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors, shared histories, language, visual representations and material realities, cultural anthropology focuses on what it means to be human. Our courses address relevant concerns such as food and nutrition; urban, rural, and global adaptive strategies; environmental sustainability; and economic development. Through its comparative and engaged field research methods, cultural anthropology recognizes culture as the primary means by which humans engage in social and environmental interactions to define meaningful and purposeful lives. Cultural anthropology complements well all other undergraduate majors.<br/>Top 3 Skills Learned<br/>- Critical thinking<br/>- Qualitative research methods<br/>- Partnership & collaboration with community<br/>Usually this happens toward the end of the Introduction to Anthropology course, when you realize that anthropology opens doors to new ways of looking at relevant problems in our world. It give you a big picture approach that liberates you from assumptions that there only a few answers to life's enduring questions.

| Fact or Myth: Sodium Raises Blood Pressure<br/>Well, Matt, it turns out a high sodium diet might not raise blood pressure, nor have any sort of adverse effect on cardiovascular health at all. But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence (and there is more evidence that says it doesn’t than does).<br/>The debate over eating too much salt has been around since the 1960s. Almost every major governmental health organization embraces the idea that eating too much salt is damaging to your health. Most major news outlets report on these recommendations and people tend to try and follow them. This is most likely why most of us, especially the elderly with heart problems, know to reduce the amount of salt we eat. Those of us who like the idea that any recommendation be backed up by solid evidence, have to step back on this one. As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.<br/>So why have most health organizations pushed the idea of low sodium diets? The theory behind their supposition is sound, and there are some studies that show a minor risk of elevated blood pressure with extremely high salt intake. Unfortunately, there are many other studies that show no increase, and still some that show reducing salt intake might actually raise your blood pressure! Let’s look at the controversy in more detail.<br/>The idea salt will increase your blood pressure has to do with osmotic pressure. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell walls), from areas of lower solute concentration (in this case salt) to areas of higher solute concentration. This naturally equalizes the solute concentration on both sides of the membrane. (This osmotic pressure is also why salt can be used to preserves meat.)<br/>So the theory goes that when we eat too much salt, our bloodstream has more sodium in it than the surrounding areas of our body. This causes the water in those areas to be pulled into our bloodstream. The increase in water within the arteries and veins causes an increase in the pressure within those arteries and veins. The salt itself also acts like an irritant within the arteries causing them to constrict. This too is thought to increase your blood pressure.<br/>The theory seems, on the surface, very sound. After all, we can make the process of salt pulling water through membranes happen time and time again in the lab. The question is, does this actually happen within our bodies, and does this actually cause long term hypertension (high blood pressure)?<br/>In 1969, Lewis Dahl testified before Sen. George McGovern’s “select committee on nutrition and human needs”. He was concerned about the high concentrations of sodium in baby foods and thought this might cause increase in people’s blood pressure long term. His reasoning was that studies done on rats showed increases in the blood pressure of the rats.<br/>The conversation about salt and hypertension began to circulate among health organizations. The National Institutes of Health, in 1972, began introducing “High Blood Pressure Education Programs”. As their evidence, they pointed out observationally, populations who ate very little sodium had low incidents of high blood pressure. They also pointed to the rat modeling. Scientists at the time questioned this, as the rat studies had them eating 60 times what the average person does. They also pointed out the populations who ate low sodium diets, also ate low amounts of other things, like sugar (which also affects osmosis).<br/>Despite their objections, publicly, the idea of high sodium diets causing high blood pressure was here to stay, and remains today. The Centers For Disease Control, The National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and many other organizations currently promote low sodium diets.<br/>Despite the seemingly unified front presented by these distinguished organizations, the controversy among scientists is extremely heated. In 1998, award winning author Taubes, published “The Political Science of Salt” in the Journal of Science. He stated, “The controversy over the benefits, if any, of salt reduction now constitutes one of the longest running most vitriolic and surreal disputes in all of medicine.”<br/>One surgeon general in a report wrote, the speed with which US federal agencies embraced sodium reduction, “stood in stark contrast to how long it had taken for recommendations to emerge on the importance of reducing blood cholesterol levels”. He also noted that the difference was even more remarkable considering the absence of published research that actually tested the theory. On the flip-side, Sir Micheal Rawlings, the chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, who promotes salt reduction diets argued that, “Guidance (in policy making) is based on the best available evidence. The evidence may not, however, be very good and is rarely complete.” Not a very strong argument for reducing salt intake.<br/>Let’s look at a few relatively recent studies. In 2008, Italian researchers began publishing the results from a series of clinical trials, all of which reported that, among patients with heart failure, reducing salt consumption increased the risk of death. These studies were followed by others which showed among Type 1 and 2 diabetics, healthy Europeans and patients with chronic heart failure, those that ate salt at the lower limit of the normal range were more likely to have heart disease than those who ate salt in the middle range of normal.<br/>In 2011, two Cochrane reviews found no evidence that low salt diets either improved or worsened peoples’ health. They stated, “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.”<br/>Even in the face of no clear scientific evidence to support it and some to the contrary, in 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Society of Hypertension all continued to promote low sodium diets as a means of controlling high blood pressure.<br/>In the end, being a medical professional and someone who needs clear evidence to make a decision about whether I get to add copious amounts of salt on my fries, I am pleased to find that so far there is very little! All the major health organizations seem to promote low sodium diets, but none have actually published consistent studies that show low sodium diets help in health, particularly not in cardiovascular health. What I find most annoying, a pet peeve of mine, is that none of these organizations tell people that the science behind their policies is controversial and they might be flat wrong. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns, and Sandro Galea said it best in their article “Salt And Public Health”- “After a careful consideration of the debate over salt, we have concluded that the concealment of scientific uncertainty is a mistake that serves neither the ends of science nor good policy.”<br/>So you should you go out and smother everything in salt now? As with most things, if science hasn’t been able to answer the question definitively one way or the other, and you want to be safe rather than sorry, just go with the age old rule of “moderation in everything”. If you, like me, like to salt everything like the rim of a margarita glass and moderation be damned, at least now you can feel a little better about it as science seems to be leaning more and more towards low sodium diets being unnecessary and high sodium ones not being harmful at all.<br/>If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below, you might also like:<br/>- Why Salt Enhances Flavor<br/>- What Do the Numbers in a Blood Pressure Test Mean and What Do They Tell the Doctor<br/>- What Causes Arms, Legs, and Feet to “Fall Asleep”<br/>- Top 5 First Aid Tricks Everyone Should Know<br/>- How to Remove a Fresh Carpet Stain with Nothing But Salt<br/>- High blood pressure is neither a disease nor an illness in and of itself. It’s merely a risk factor for other problems. For instance, if you have chronic high blood pressure, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke goes up significantly. This high pressure could be caused by excessive plaque on the inside of your artery walls, making those arteries in effect, smaller. Think plumbing. When the pipes that transport fluid get smaller, the pressure that same volume of fluid exerts goes up. What happens if your blood pressure gets too high? I’ll answer that question with another one. What happens if the water pressure in your houses pipes gets too high? Your pipes burst. Same thing here. Should your blood pressure get too high, your arteries have a greater chance of bursting. If there is too much gunk inside your pipes (plaque inside your arteries), that ball of gunk could get too big and clog off your pipes! Seems bad too me! Especially, if those arteries are in your brain, or heart. It’s not like kidneys, where you have two! You spring a leak in those organs, and your family finally gets that big paycheck from your life insurance policy! Not really the best way to get paid, well, unless you’re really a jerk and everyone in your family hates you! Then they might not mind so much, but you certainly would.<br/>- Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury. For reference, 1 psi (pounds per square inch) is equal to 51.7149326 millimeters of mercury. If you were bleeding and wanted to stop the blood-loss with direct pressure, and you should, you would only need to use about 3 psi to stop it. Unless they have really high blood pressure, then maybe 4 psi. Basic math saves the day again!<br/>- The first known experiment to measure the exact pressure of blood was performed by Stephen Hales on December 1, 1733. He took a live horse. Attached a tube to her left crural artery, then allowed her blood to rush through the tube and it rose to a height of 8’3”. He noted that “when it was at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each pulse 2, 3,or 4 inches”. Yes the horse bled out, but don’t think Mr. Hales was too cruel, he performed the experiment on a horse that was about to be put down anyway! To the horse, I’m sure this distinction didn’t matter much of course. 🙂<br/>*Legal Disclaimer: While I am a medical professional, this article contains general information about medical conditions and treatments.

Whenever I eat crisps (chips if you live in the USA) which have a fairly large amount of salt, my BP goes up significantly the next few days.<br/>I tried getting saltless crisps about a week ago and added my own “lo-salt” (a salt substitute consisting of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (salt), but twice as much as the former than the latter).<br/>Anyway the lo-salt flavoured crisps (chips) diodn’t raise my BP at all.<br/>OK I know that further experiments on myself is required. But at the moment I’m strongly suspecting salt as the culprit. I’m also suspect that sugar increases my BP too. But lots of investigation required to establish that!<br/>Maybe you have a poor potassium to sodium balance. My mum has hypertension and was on a low sodium diet but she was not getting enough potassium and her blood pressure was not stable. If you are concerned you may want to have your blood potassium level checked.<br/>Now that she is consuming enough potassium she her blood pressure has been normal for over a year while consuming sodium within normal ranges(more than 2500 mg)<br/>It’s not the sodium…. it’s the fat and starch that is making you fatter and fatter; and that, is you body mass increasing and making it harder for your heart to pump blood through the veins and arteries that get squished in your body by the increased amount of accumulated fat.<br/>you are eating pure bloody starch and pointing to salt instead of the sugar, anything to avoid incrimination of sugar not too mention vegetable oil that increases all causes of death. You get far more osmolality from the sugar<br/>Hard evidence needed? Not a myth and very easy to document — requires little intelligence or training, anyone can do it. At the age of 52-54, this was over a two year period (2005 and 2006). Used a software program (Diet Power 4 — I paid $50 for it but it is now free to download) to track food, sodium, and bicycle exercise time. Produced graphs using the pen and paper method although will do the same thing being the program had no provisions to enter data on blood pressure. A doctor taking a reading every three to six months is absolutely is of no value in my opinion if an effort is not made to take the reading under identical circumstances other than to show a general trend over several years.<br/>I found that to be of any value, for my graph type and hypothesis (now proven), it was necessary to take several readings over a period of at least five minutes or until two close (three or less numerical spread and no more than three bpm on heart rate) readings. I would take note of readings after a two mile walk or an hour of biking at a slow to moderate rate. Wide swings over five minutes quit after I got in physical shape and stayed on the diet. Professional sites recommend sitting down 3 minutes or more and taking more than one reading but I only had one or two doctors in the last twenty years doing that, some over the need to quickly see another patient. A nurse claimed the significant reason for taking blood pressure readings were the insurance companies insisting on it. She claimed some doctors did not look at the readings she took so who cares if an effort was made to get an accurate reading was her conclusion.<br/>Walk in after rushing to show up on time, climbing stairs or whatever, sit down, a nurse grabs your arm and takes your blood pressure. At one time I convinced a doctor to take a second reading after ten minutes of discussing with me my medical problems. He claimed he had seldom waited, a man with 15 years of experience although professional sites recommended waiting three minutes. Another doctor claimed he had never heard of Na effecting blood pressure (he had been an army doctor with different standards for education he claimed).<br/>Now to the results. The graphs were beautiful and showed a perfect coalition between the the five factors entered; food type, sodium amounts, exercise, heart rate, weight.<br/>I had been on blood pressure medicine for ten years with only a numerical change of 5. I also was in sedentary employment and received zero exercise. My weight was at the upper end of normal weight or slightly overweight. I would would eat typical amounts of sodium for Americans (2,000+ mg) over two days. Then various amounts of low sodium for 4 days then gradually increase over a period of several days. After 72+ hours of a low sodium diet and exercise program, my blood pressure would drop significantly. 135/90 to 110/70 over three days was typical after being on my diet plan (the DASH diet) for one month. Sugar levels and high chemical foods were also recorded as part of diet. Sodium intake showed up more than others exercise as the biggest variable. High chemical foods also showed a difference although high chemical foods often have high sodium levels.<br/>Over four day after resuming the DASH diet there would be a significant and gradual change to the upside. It takes two or more days, depending on physical activity and water consumption to dissipate the sodium in your blood is my hypothesis although I have never confirmed this from research.<br/>I suspect sodium levels for proper blood pressure varies between people and different body designs (gender, race, activity, fat vs skinny, exercise level, etc). Many people may have little if any effect from a 2,000 mg vs 600 mg of Na. I’m not one of those. It is estimated cavemen had a diet of 400 to 600mg Na. What was good enough for cavemen (who had short lives for other reasons) was good enough for me.<br/>I had to make an effort to stay at 600 mg because of my diet. The diet I was on was 200 to 400 mg if I did not force myself to use that salt shaker). Sodium is a necessary part of your diet. I found Na amounts over 1000 mg were too much for my body. I have hypertension and heart palpitations with shortness of breath. My thyroid lab readings became perfect and the doctor took me off thyroid medication and blood pressure medication. My heart palliation’s and shortness of breath at 3 to 5 a.m. every night quit after one month. All my problems resumed significantly when I got off my diet plan/exercise in recent years. Of interest one older doctor who had been in the profession for forty years claimed I was only one of two people that went from a TSH level of 0.0 to 4.0 (the upper range of normal) after quitting the medication. Thyroid problems have resumed along with blood pressure, heart and heart palliation’s. I have now resumed the diet and exercise plan and tracking. I’ll send in an update after three months.<br/>I’m only one person, so put 400 people on the same program I’ve been on and see what happens. Problem of course is finding 200 honest people out of that 400 that do not fib on the diet and exercise database or guess. It also takes will power to stick to a program. I stuck with it for ten years then quit for miscellaneous reasons. Remove the ones from the database that show no improvement who refuse to swear under oath and take a lie detector test!<br/>Salt (Sodium) DOES raise your blood pressure. I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 130/90. She told me to control my salt (sodium 1500mg limit) and I had a check up two days later with my blood pressure 108/87. Anytime I eat lots of salty foods, I get a spike in my pressure. I am definitely salt sensitive.<br/>SALT (SODIUM) DOES affect your blood pressure. You have to be careful (it sneaks up on you good) and adjust your diet to limit sodium intake and watch for signs of your pressure raising. Especially when your body behavior changes.<br/>Work out as well! If you are lazy or not that active, take 30 minute walks 5 days a week (150 minutes total) minimum to get a decent exercise.<br/>I think the point is that recommending a lower sodium diet, that maybe affects a specific set of people, those who already have hypertension and are salt sensitive, to an entire population is ridiculous. Another point is whether high salt intake leads to chronic cardiovascular problems, which is being touted as fact to the public but has no research to back it up. I consume way more sodium than the CDC recommends and my BP has never been higher than 117/70, my highest ever, normal about 100-110/65-70. Neither of our cases prove one way or the other the effects “high” sodium intake has on the general population.<br/>You may have low cellular potassium, high copper, low vitamin k2, low magnesium, low vitamin E, heavy metal toxicity such as lead, everyone is exposed to lead and fluoride, these things compound each other.<br/>Look at conditions that cause you to have this salt sensitivity such as low potassium high cortisol.<br/>Don’t just rest on salt because you likely will have multiple issues as well almost no-one just eats salt by itself.<br/>Salt is generally found in high simple sugar no fiber foods with additives.<br/>Understand guidelines are for the whole population not just for you, this is problematic because unrefined salt is not shown to be unhealthy for most people and to some it improves health and in making these guidelines with no recognition of biochemical individuality.<br/>Understand lowering HBP is not the be all and end all, this has been mechanically done by drugs in studies which show no improvement in outcomes and even worsening of symptoms outside of the sign of BP measurement.<br/>Things to consider, Olive leaf extract, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin k2, potassium, curcumin, stevia(the natural sweetener), magnesium, pomegranite, l-arginine, nattokinase, fish oil, cocoa, beetroot, alpha lipoic acid, bromelain, flax seed, celery, coq10, flax seed, hawthorne. All these improve BP and cardiovascular issues. You have a lot more in your toolkit than you think<br/>As for Sugar, women should limit their sugar (Total Carbs is what matters and watch out for certain sugar alcohols) 20g-30g a snack and 30g-45g each meal. Men should keep their snack the same as women 20g-30g a snack and 60g – 75g a meal. The lowest numbers are the lmit for diabetics of course.<br/>I believe that some people have a sensitivity to sodium. I’m convinced that I do. After being on 3 different BP meds at one time and still having uncontrolled hypertension, I started reading food labels and drastically reducing my sodium intake. Most processed foods are loaded with sodium. I have been able to stop 2 meds completely and reduce the third one to 1/4 the prescribed dosage. For me, reducing sodium has made a huge difference. Last night I took 10 mg of lisinopril, which is 1/4 of the prescribed daily dosage. Today my BP is too low, 105/48. I really have to consistently monitor it, as low BP isn’t much fun, either.<br/>Blood pressure drugs are ineffective, they fail to improve outcomes only the BP reading.<br/>You have reduced your intake of low potassium high salt high sugar low fiber junk foods, this was always going to lower your blood pressure.<br/>Salt is not the enemy you just require potassium and antioxidants to balance it out and lower stress.<br/>When people reduce sodium in this way you cant contribute it to salt itself, you have completely altered your dietary intake of many things, this is how people can be fooled into thinking its a single thing.<br/>This attribution of a singular cause to problems is constantly done in hypothesis and they tend to be completely bogus demonizing singular things like Co2, salt, saturated fat, cholesterol, lack of seratonin, even lack of the poison fluorides use.<br/>These are all myths that fail under scrutiny but continue to be upheld as causes by regulating bodies by cherry picking and dismissal of minimization of overwhelming contradictions. The pharmaceutical junk food and vegetable oil corporations benefit and misinform the public for profit to which the FDA racketeers for them killing off their competition.<br/>Medicine research and much of other research is a cesspool of incestuous deception between private interest and boosting the economy as well as politicians doctors and government profit.<br/>The editors of the journals studies are published in find most studies to be entirely lacking, conclusions to be spun towards confirmation bias and that we are in quite a dark age for science where belief, consensus and peer review are less about good science and more about blackballing competing belief and evidence that will damage profits and future grants.<br/>Yea, whatever. Believe what you want. I have been reading health books for years….DECADES…and I’ve have read in them EXACTLY what is printed in this article. There NEVER has been a proven link between salt and high blood pressure. Furthermore, in one of books it pointed out that salt is used to make stomach acid, and it’s ironic that as we age, the low sodium diet so often touted leads to digestive problems.<br/>Keep believing doctors who take 3 credits of Nutrition in college and pitch compounds that cause worse side effects than the actual disease.<br/>Doctors, who say Chiropractic is “not real medicine.” Read the Winsdor papers. A doctor who set out to prove Chiro was fake by doing autopsies found that 99 out of 100 organ failures were due to lack of nerve energy caused by “subluxations” which pinch the nerves and interrupt nerve energy flow. (I’m not a chiropractor).<br/>Go read books by Norman Walker, (especially “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.”), TC Fry, and Herbert M. Shelton (Superior Nutrition, Fasting can save your life). I’ve read them all.<br/>BOTTOM LINE this is an excellent article and I’m actually surprised to see the truth so openly posted in an article like this…but you believe what you want & take chemicals pushed by the medical profession…eat what you want, drink what you want, don’t exercise and when things go wrong just take a pill….<br/>I attempted to look up these “Winsdor Papers” and even Google doesn’t know what you are talking about. If you really want to win people over, you should actually post links to the information you want us to read.<br/>Guys you all are missing one point: sodium is poisonous to us. Even if does not raise BP, its still poison ;/ not good at all<br/>@Marco: You would die instantly without sodium in your body.<br/>I am not the same Marco as Mr. “Salt is poison”. Just to be clear<br/>Of course – everything in excess is bad – heck, even drinking too much water will kill you.<br/>Now, every person is different so you have to find what works for you. Mine, I like salted 🙂<br/>This article is misleading. Just because salt’s negative effect on blood pressure is a “theory” doesn’t mean we should ignore it. In fact most of medicine and science is carried out on plausible theories. The truth is a low salt diet is less harmful than a high salt diet and like all things the real moral of the story is moderation. Also this author contradicts themselves by saying there is “no evidence… Yes none” to support this theory, but then goes on to cite at least one study that shows the negative corrolatuon in humans and another involving rats. That’s evidence, at least some not none. Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that. Sure sometimes we are far from knowing but in this case there’s enough science behind salts impact on BP to make it worth considering. Also remember the human consumption of high salt quantities is a fairly new thing on the evolutionary scale, so it’s impact on our bodies is fairly unnatural.<br/>@Mike: “No evidence… Yes none” I think Scott is meaning “No reputable evidence” Or, rather, “No evidence that is not flawed.”<br/>“Everything in moderation” Yep, exactly. As Scott is fond of saying, “Even water will kill you in high enough doses.” He even once told me a story of a woman he attempted to treat for this very thing- she drank massive amounts of water and ended up dying from it.<br/>“Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that.” I don’t think any doctors would ever say that. Maybe a century or two ago. But there is an amazing amount of good science involved here these days. We are far from knowing everything, but it’s certainly not black magic or just guess work, as that would seem to imply.<br/>Sorry to disagree with you Dave. But even on the sources of the video, the rise of blood pressure on high-salt diets is evident. While in the end of one of them, while talking about softdrinks and snacks companies:<br/>“Some of these companies have been preeminent in trying to create an artificial controversy doubting the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure,16,17 presumably in the hope of stopping or slowing down any reduction in population salt intake to protect soft drink sales.”<br/>Even, I’m not a specialist in the area, the lacks of a literature review in source about this matter is disturbing.<br/>oh diets that are processed foods with low fat high sugar high additive, observational studies are meaningless, these people are eating copious amounts of sugar each year. If you think corporations are trying to be allowed to use more salt its ridiculous distraction in doing anything to not look at the sugar metabolism syndrome epidemic.<br/>How moronic that you think observational studies matter for anything other than proposing a hypothesis, you then use intervention and double-blind placebo studies with no variables to prove them causal. THIS IS NOT DONE, this is also not done for cholesterol or saturated fat. You are a gullible victim of pathological science, when he says there is no evidence there is no evidence observational studies do no control for anything they are not an experiment, this is not how science works. You do understand cochrane are perhaps the most neutral group for clinical study in the world and they reviewed 150 trials and 13 population studies. Here you are saying their findings are wrong based on what? nothing other than your belief based on a hypothesis with no evidence.<br/>I suggest you read the book “Salt”. It is mostly a geopolitical historical account of salt in our civilization, but it also has a good deal of science in it. We built our civilization on salt.<br/>The first paragraph says ” just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence,” I believe that since this is a scientific minded website it shouldn’t use the word theory in this context, since in science, a theory is an accepted explanation of a phenomenon, proven by testing.<br/>Yeah, he should have used hypothesis. I’m going to have to look up the history of theory and see if anyone knows how it ended up with two such different meanings.<br/>For a medical professional (which leads to an assumption of advanced education), you have a horrible grasp of grammar and spelling. This discredits much of what you say, in my mind. Having someone else review your work before publishing would go a long way.<br/>I will continue to listen to my cardiologist on this matter and limit my salt intake.<br/>@Mark: Something you’ll find seemingly true about a large number of medical professionals, the stereotype of their handwriting being horrible is generally correct. (Scott’s is particularly bad.) And their technical writing can also sometimes be particularly terrible, pre-edit. (They study medicine and the human body, not writing, after all) But, in over 100+ articles Scott has written, he has never been shown to be wrong on a main point (and only a few cases of being wrong on a minor point). Typos? Awkward sentence? You will always find at least one of these in each of his articles, despite my sincerest efforts to get rid of them all. But in the end, I care about accuracy much more than grammar. Both would be good, but finding a writer of Scott’s particular expertise and ability to think critical and process vast amounts of medical knowledge is extremely difficult. These people aren’t a dime a dozen. 🙂<br/>But really, the strength of Scott’s arguments are never based on his extensive medical knowledge. That just helps him thoroughly vet the various studies on the subject where most would get lost in the terminology, let alone be able to think critically about them and their methodology. The strength of the argument is the studies themselves. In this one, you’d do well to actually read the two Cochrane reviews, and perhaps forward them to your cardiologist for his/her thoughts.<br/>Don’t be surprised if he/she has already ready them though, and maybe even agrees with them. What doctors tell their patients doesn’t always line up with what they actually know or believe to be true. Particularly in cases like this where lawsuits may be a very real possibility if they told you to eat all the salt you wanted, then you died of a heart issue (but having nothing to do with the salt), then your family sues them and cites what various government agencies say on the subject, rather than what the medical world actually thinks. 🙂 Watching your sodium isn’t likely to hurt either, but covers the cardiologists’ backside. (I actually had an interesting discussion about this with Scott just last night about a doctor he was discussing this with who said something very similar as to why despite that he knows sodium isn’t going to be harmful in this way, he still tells certain of his patients to watch their sodium intake.)<br/>In the end, as I always say, “Question everything,” but also when questioning, do the research to find the answers too, and then double check that research just to make sure. 🙂 And, maybe don’t make the mistake of equating grammar and writing ability with knowledge of a subject or intelligence. I’ve worked with a ton of writers. I can say, journalists (and other such people with a writing background) are great at writing… They almost all are horrid at research, which surprised me on the journalists, but maybe explains a lot about the state of media reporting on scientific studies. Funny enough, the best combo of writing ability and research seems to be lawyers. They are phenomenal at both in my experience. Scientists, or people with a science background, tend to be poor at writing, but incredible at research and critical thinking. Of course, that’s only going with a sample-size of a few dozen writers I’ve worked with, and there is one exception I’ve found in that, but it’s a trend I’ve observed.<br/>I think everyone must be different. For me salt raises my blood pressure a lot. I check the bl pr 4-6x a day. Stays low enough when i stay under 300 mg of salt. As soon as i eat a lot of salt, like chinese food or even a meat and cheese sub or two slices of pizza my bl pr goes to 170/98. It takes a couple days to get the salt out of my body. Then it will go down to 130/80 and sometimes a bit lower. I am 67.<br/>you just offered up things containing large amounts of simple carbohydrates, also containing wheat. Sugar has high osmolality but is ignored due to the weight applied to salt<br/>Dietary wheat elimination alone can lower bp by 20-40 mmHG. The company life extension says this also beneficially optimizes blood lipid profiles.<br/>Do you see how you are perhaps basing what you see on assumption based on what you have been told based on the hypothesis that has no evidence.<br/>cardiovascular issues in observational studies only found a correlation with people eating the very large amount of 5 grams of salt a day, you can imagine what amount of junk foods they are eating to attain this amount.<br/>If your problem is salt you have an underlying condition causing it because you are not getting a high amount in any way, however you are also ignoring other causes which is the problem when singular things are touted as the main contributing factor when no evidence suggests they are the cause.<br/>consider your cellular potassium, copper, lead exposure, magnesium, vitamin E intake, coq10 levels, irritants and stress that can increase coagulation and vessel constriction.<br/>If I may comment on the whole spelling/grammar controversy… in my experience from observing people, the populace (at least the intelligent ones, my whole family is high IQ and my husband is a genius, literally, and as I have no lower-intelligence friends for a control group, I can only speak from my observations of my family and husband’s family,) is divided into two types: math-people and word-people. My father was a math person, as was I when I was very small, however, I lived with my mother, who is most definitely a words person, my whole life, leading to my developing into a words person. My husband may very well be the smartest person I’ve ever met, but from his spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, you’d never know it. He’s a computer repair tech, can fix anything, highly versatile in his job abilities, can solve algebra problems that I’m struggling with for minutes at a time with just a glance, but can’t spell our son’s name.<br/>As far as I can tell, scientists tend to be math people more than word people. (Just for the record, one of my previous jobs was research, and I’m a grammar Nazi and sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>I was wondering if I could ask the author of this article for a small favor.<br/>At the beginning I read this sentence in regard to salt intake:<br/>“But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize [it is just a theory] and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence…”<br/>Here you are using “Theory” in its popular parlance. WHich is fine and all. The problem is that this is a scientific related article and when a theory is not supported by evidence we call it a “Hypothesis”.<br/>Those of us that write in the scientific realm should make an effort to make this distinction, mostly because the next time I get some Young Earth Creationist telling me evolution is “just a theory” I swear I am going to start jumping up and down like a Chimpanzee and make backward sammerault. Then I’ll throw feces at him/her.<br/>I am sure you don’t want such a scene to become reality. Heck, you probably don’t want to think it up in your mind.<br/>So let’s start a campaign to call a Theory a “a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena” and call anything that is meant to be pulled from one’s rear orifice an “Hypothesis”.<br/>BTW: I know the dictionary return both meanings. FOr the sake of Science, let’s change the meaning back since we already have a good working word for “I just pulled this out of my ass”.<br/>@Marco: That’s a good point. I’ll start working that distinction in to future articles. 🙂<br/>Not a single legitimate conclusion can be drawn from a single blood pressure measurement. BP varies widely even from moment to moment. I have many times seen 160/100 drop to 130/75 over the course of a few minutes. As well, BP measuring equipment is highly variable and susceptible to wide variations from things like cuff size and user variations.<br/>Any conclusions drawn from a few measurements are nothing more than speculation and wishful thinking.<br/>First, this is not a peer-reviewed journal article. I agree, the correct use of “theory” has been obfuscated by the colloquial “just a hunch” version. But, let’s move on, ok?<br/>I don’t get that the article is in the least bit misleading. I do get that the author makes the point that apparently is lost on many — “As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.”<br/>He also mentions to think critically. So, if you don’t believe him, a) continue with your belief, or b) find out for yourself. Do the legwork. Read the articles. Now you have a starting point. Thank him for that.<br/>In my opinion, focusing on the occasional grammatical error or “theory vs. hunch” debate unnecessarily diminishes the author’s intent. My takeaway is that this article helps challenge my assumptions about what I thought was already scientifically concluded. I learned something. That’s the point.<br/>@Michael Stelly I am not sure if you were referring specifically to my post in regard to the usage of “theory”, but I assure you that my comment was not intended to criticize the writer at all. At least not in the same terms as a grammatical or spelling “error”.<br/>My comment is not about an “error” rather it is a suggestion that those of us that read and write about science do our part to reclaim the usage of the word “theory” from the mainstream or that at least we try.<br/>There are those that comment on obvious spelling errors and I agree they are not important in the context of the information provided in the article (although I agree they can be distracting and I am speaking from a non native English speaker), but unless their number and character is such that they make understanding the article difficult or even impossible, you won’t find me posting about them.<br/>The word “theory” on the other hand is a word that is being actively used by certain factions of the science / religion discussion to discount 200 years of scientific advancement and it is being actively used to mislead children into discounting science as a whole.<br/>If you have watched the Nye – Ham debate, Gawker asked some creationists to write a question to evolution supporters on a piece of paper and they published these questions in the form of pictures. Invariably the “it’s just a theory” question appeared.<br/>It’s in that spirit that I have asked the curators of this website to try to use the word in its scientific meaning. If we in the science and technical fields don’t do that, we cannot expect those that want to distort science for their objectives to do it on their own.<br/>So, with all due respect, I won’t take your advice. I will certainly let slide silly spelling errors but this is important to me and it should be important to all of us that love science.<br/>no one distorts science more than evolutionists, inference and speculation based on an assumption of fact are not evidence. No field has as many hoaxes and assumptions as evolution.<br/>Continuing to use the flawed contrasting argument and assumption that because creation must be wrong evolution must be true is not science, the evidence does not show macroevolution to be possible at this point under any of the many current competing theories based solely on mutation and natural selection. I would suggest another mechanism must be found.<br/>As it stands contradictory evidence is completely ignored or even claimed as evidence of a more complex process but still a proof of evolution when it is no such thing in all cases.<br/>We currently have evidence for abiogenesis that it is an absolute fact as is microevolution absolutely correct, however, in terms of macroevoltuion I would suggest science returned to being based on evidence not an assumption of fact and skewing of data to induce it too fit the theory.<br/>As it stands evolution is not science it is a belief much like the big bang theory which has massive conflicting evidence that in the past when people used evidence to prove or disprove theories this theory would have been shelved, the combination of both these theories is akin to a religion, the religion of secular humanists. It is as political as they come the communities that uphold these beliefs black ball and ad hominem they cannot stand on the evidence but on intimidation. Studies show ad hominem is as useful as reasoned argument, this is used by illigitamate science suche as Co2 based climate alarmism and macroevolution which currently do not have evidence in their favor yet use the same types of propaganda and attacks suggesting anyone opposing them is anti-science or a moron.<br/>I suggest reading http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>People who do not agree with evolution don’t automatically believe creation, the evolutionist always attacks and distracts from their own weak argument creates their own strawman of what others believe and assume based on their own often moronic assumptions that they are backed by evidence when they are not.<br/>One fact I would like to add:<br/>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are another piece of evidence in this controversy. Interestingly, thiazides are called diuretics but when taken daily this diuretic effect becomes almost zero. After a period of chronic thiazide therapy, the primary benefit these medications provide is that they increase the elimination of sodium and chloride ions from the blood by way of the Na/Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule (along with other effects such as retention of calcium). Despite losing the diuretic effect thiazides retain their blood pressure lowering effects long-term and are one of the medications used first line for lowering blood pressure. This lowering effect is generally attributed to the elimination of sodium and seems to be in line with the idea that high sodium levels do increase blood pressure.<br/>Believe it or not. Salt appears to lower my BP. If I eat too many chips I actually get dizzy from low BP. Can’t say I get it.<br/>This “theory” is simply stupid. Salt DOES increase blood pressure big time! It’s a fact, observed, monitored. Accidentally eat some pretty salty stuff one day than needed a week of diuretics to get rid of all that salt from the body and bring the blood pressure from 190-200 (!!yes, that high it got!!!) back to normal (120-130). So don’t tell stories which aren’t true.<br/>Not all people respond the same to dietary salt. My suggestion for us is to take note of the sodium level in our normal lab results in minimal annual physicals.<br/>From childhood, I am used to take more salt with my meals, but never faced the problem of High BP, instead sometimes it goes below normal. I Googled this problem & came to the conclusion that my body needs salt more than normal to compensate for genetically transmitted ‘Low BP’ problem. So? Your Brain is the instructor for your health. You must follow its orders to stay Really Healthy!<br/>Well, I’m just a nutritionist (like a University Nutrition major that will be graduating in May) and maybe what I learnt is bull, but after being thought about the pathophysiology of how sodium can impact blood pressure, I find that the recommendation makes sense, but you would need to do more than just cut sodium. One thing that’s important is the sodium: potassium ratio (ie you eat a bunch of high processed, sodium added foods compared to fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables). I’ll admit that not everyone is salt sensitive and that we have consciously decided, in the health field, to assume that everyone is because testing for salt-sensitiveness (if that’s a word!) is expensive, long, and impractical. But the idea that there is no good plausible evidence linking salt and hypertension is false. Here’s just 6 articles. These aren’t the ones that were given by our professors to read (though if you want me to find them for you I’m sure I can), but they’re good one’s nonetheless and you don’t need a special University code or membership to access them. Anyways, here you go in case you want to read more:<br/>Do any of those show that there’s a correlation without other factors? You say “you would need to do more than just cut sodium”… is there evidence that doing those other actions without cutting sodium doesn’t work as well as cutting sodium too?<br/>Did you not read? Cochrane used 150 trials and 13 studies right? so you have 6, this is your “education” at work. Brainwashing and then confirmation biased search for support of the faulty hypothesis that has been found to be not of high quality already.<br/>If Cochrane did not use it it is not a high quality article, if it did then the support was not significant in the article. The osmolality mechanism applies to high sugar diets yet its all about salt<br/>The problem here is low quality studies are published constantly that people infer causation from where they can’t possibly do so as they did not control all the variables.<br/>The same thing is done for the lipid hypothesis and the cholesterol hypothesis.<br/>These are also myths, cholesterol from all data is inversely related to heart disease slightly.<br/>Statins absolute risk reduction for heart disease is 1.4% this is hardly significant, statins effects for decreasing heart problems in those already having a heart attack may be entirely due to their effect as an anticoagulant. Once again pathological junk science is being used to push treatments without recognizing mechanisms and variables. Most people will be harmed by inhibiting vitamin k coq10 and cholesterol synthesis via statins yet doctors backed by pharmaceutical greed promote giving them to everyone.<br/>Saturated fat has no mechanism via which it can raise cholesterol, no study of oil replacement purely substituted fat for oil in double blinds controls all variables and the closer they come to doing so the worse the outcomes for PUFA intervention becomes increasing all causes of death.<br/>Like is said the trials are low quality there is not much will to overturn hypothesis that regulating bodies and doctors have a religious belief in that is not backed by evidence. This misinformation leads to poor health and pharmaceutical profit.<br/>I have been torn between to eat more salt or not, because eating more salt reduces my heart rate and BP and makes me sleep better; my hands and feet feel full and warm. My sweat volume increase as I bike or walk. But then after taking it for a week or 2 then I notice that BP becomes persistently high; which makes me feel I did wrong by eating. What this article mentions is fluid volume increase which is interesting. Before increasing my salt intake my fingers feel thin. Maybe after fluid levels feel normal cut back on salt to normal levels. So I am just hypothesizing that people who have are salt sensitive have good fluid volume and should watch salt intake, others can take salt but stop when it feels full. Basically use salt maintain fluid volume.<br/>Based on self-experimentation, I think maintaining fluid volume is very important. At times, I find that I feel thirsty and drink water and that it keeps coming out; that calls for some salt intake. Basically, I do not eat canned food or much fast foods, my salt intake is what is purposely added in cooking. After exercise, (eating by the book and working out etc cause problems too) I notice that when I stand up from sitting position, I feel dizzy but not normally. I think I may be sweating out salt and , of course, I drink a lot of water during the exercise. I am not proposing eating more salt. What I am stating is the way the body is telling you that your salt is depleted is when you are not feeling full in your feet and hands. I think this is correct to some extent, as the body works more on concentration of things than the absolute amounts. It is not a comprehensive theory as there are other things that may increase blood volume, you may be already having too much salt in blood etc. For the record, my sodium in the blood is always near the low end of the range so my err wont push me outside of the range.<br/>Ok what is the conclusion? do I use the salt shaker now or not? I have been holding too long.<br/>I think this article is irresponsible in that salt absolutely does raise bp in those who have a salt sensitivity. If I eat something very salty I can literally go into hypertensive crisis in a matter of an hour.<br/>This type of sensitivity is common and to not mention it (because it does not fit with the authors theory?) is dangerous.<br/>@Jim porter: “because it does not fit with the authors theory?” The “author’s theory” doesn’t exist. That’s really not what we do here. This is an article simply writing about scientific studies on the topic and saying what they say, so you don’t have to sift through them and all the medical jargon; we do it for you- essentially what we write about reflects the current state of human knowledge on the subject at hand. If it changes at some point, we update the article. In this case, however, most notably the two Cochrane reviews are pretty convincing: “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.” There are exceptions to every rule, and seemingly you are one and that’s very interesting if so and it would be interesting to learn the root cause. But, again, we look at what the scientific studies say and try to reflect that in what we write. Essentially we write a form of “light-reading” style entertaining survey papers on subjects, rather than write research papers.<br/>Stressing about salt will likely kill you long before salt itself will. Do what makes you happy and you will likely live longer than otherwise; and even if you don’t, at least you’ll enjoy the time you have.<br/>I believe the problem is when salt is mixed with fat and THAT causes high blood pressure. For example, someone talked about theirs rising when eating crisps/chips-that’s because the chips contain fat. The same would apply say to french fries or other fatty dishes. However, if you were to sprinkle salt on something like fruit, it wouldn’t have the same effect and not raise your blood pressure.<br/>I do think sodium gets a bad rap and some people actually do consume too little. I think having salt with fruit or salads is o.k. but the problem is the salt/fat combination and if you think about it, that’s where people usually get their salt-in potato chips, french fries, heavily seasoning meats, in creamy dishes, etc.<br/>The person who wrote this article adds nothing of value to the discussion about high blood pressure except to encourage people to stick their heads in the sand.<br/>I have been wrestling with high blood pressure for about 12 years since a serious accident caused me to be physically inactive for about a year after the accident.<br/>High blood pressure can be controlled with and without medications and individuals respond differently to different treatments and there are natural cures for this affliction.<br/>High blood pressure can cause strokes, brain hemmorhages and contribute to diabetes and kidney disease.<br/>The balance between potassium and sodium in our blood is very critical and unfortunately most doctors don’t have a clue about the effect that nutrition and proper hydration has on this condition.<br/>Most of the doctors I have been to just give out prescriptions which may or may not work.<br/>There are natural substances which have enabled me to lower my blood pressure within a few days from extremely high to almost normal while doctors and pharmacists will say that medications (like Cozaar and Norvasc)may take up to a month to work.<br/>I’ve found that the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water<br/>had significant effects.<br/>Drinking this once or twice per day has had a very significant effect in my case; my blood pressure went from 220/95 to 130/90 within 3 days.<br/>Garlic (deodorized) also helps and fruit or vegetable juices with lowered salt content and high potassium content also help. (V-8 low salt or V-8 green).<br/>This is not wishful thinking; it has to do with chemistry; this doesn’t mean that everyone will respond the same to these treatments but I disagree very strongly when someone says that salt has no effect<br/>on blood pressure.<br/>This seems to me to be irresponsible and cavalier, unless of course you work for one of the salt manufacturers.<br/>Salt is necessary and most table salts have iodine in them, which is an essential nutrient for humans.<br/>Drinking sufficient amounts of pure water is also very important; something that my doctors never bothered to mention.<br/>This enables the body to rid itself of excess salt and helps the body cleanse itself.<br/>There are many natural substances and some foods (like pesto) which can help lower blood pressure and you can find many posts on the internet about them.<br/>Web Md and The Mayo Clinic both have posts on the subject and I trust them a hell of alot more than the author of this post.<br/>This appears to me to be an exercise in defending the indefensible.<br/>To what purpose?<br/>Who was Hippocrates anyway and what the hell did he know?<br/>I have extremely low blood pressure. If I stand up too fast, I’ll faint flat on my face. My doctor told me to eat as much salt as I want, no worries.<br/>In any case, I’ll take all of this advice with a pinch of… you know what. ;-D<br/>I eat a lot of salt (and I do mean a *LOT*). A few years ago after getting fed up with constantly being told how bad this is, I decided to put it to the test. As a Ph.D. I know how to scientifically plan a test, and over several months minimizing as many variables as possible, I tested my blood pressure while at my regular salt intake versus low salt intake. The results were pretty much as expected, although some people /may/ be slightly intolerant to relatively high levels of salt intake, for me there was no difference at all. I have returned to eating food the way I like it (salty), and tell anybody who advises against this they simply don’t know what they are talking about LOL<br/>I’m 27 female. I started having high blood pressure while I was taking Accutane a year and a half ago (Accutane increases cholesterol buildup). What I experienced was intense, my pulse was at 120bpm, I was dizzy, my hands clamped up into an unusual claw shape and they tingled until they lost feeling. I thought I was actually dying. I was told it was just a panic attack, but I’ve never had any real anxiety issues. I was given oxygen for an entire hour when suddenly I started craving salt. I asked my friend to run to mcdonalds and get me some extra salty fries. Within minutes of eating all that salt, my blood pressure was back to normal, my hands got their feeling back, and I could walk and breath normally again.<br/>I find the things that trigger it the most for me are a lack of sleep, not eating anything all day, corn, wheat, and chemical salts such as MSG. But sea salt and normal table salt don’t make it worse, they make it better! With that said, I’ve always had blood test results showing high levels of potassium. Could this somehow be involved? My Dr. Just shrugs it off as caused by my love for potatoes and citrus fruits lol<br/>You might need a new doctor high potassium or hyperkalemia can cause the episodes you describe and Accutane can cause hyperkalemia.<br/>Potassium and sodium are obviously related as your cells constantly exchange these into and out of cells to maintain higher intracellular concentrations of potassium.<br/>Cortisol which raises with sleep deprivation, not eating and other stresses reverses this process of potassium concentration into the cell, but is meant to increase potassium excretion, cellular uptake of sodium absorption and sodium retention in the kidneys, there may be something going wrong with this process with potassium not being excreted. The normal reason is the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system which regulates blood pressure.<br/>Salt nourishes adrenals but you might want to get some more vitamin C which is concentrated there as well as in the pituitary gland as these regulate your cortisol and vit c lowers cortisol and stress likely lessening the severity of episodes.<br/>Things to look into, magnesium, vitamin e, adrenal glandular, copper/zinc levels, kidney and adrenal function.<br/>Pharmacist here. Thank you for all the helpful comments on this site. One can see all the intelligently written posts from people who have reduced their high blood pressure by limiting salt. I am one of these people. My blood pressure a year ago was running on average 180/120 when not medicated, and when on 3 different medications, on average 140/90. After feeling awful, either from adverse effects from the meds or from headaches from high blood pressure, I decided to alter my diet. The results I achieved were stunning. Blood pressure perfectly normal, 120/80. No headaches, or feeling like my throat was swollen, or feeling like my head was too hot….I could go on and on. I did this with NO expensive products. I just, as much as is possible nowadays in the U.S., ate non-processed foods, and avoided all added salt. Notice, all “added” salt. As many have correctly pointed out, salt is necessary to human life. And many foods naturally contain all the salt we need, so it is not necessary to add any. Listening to these supposed experts, I wonder how any humans ever survived 10,000 years ago if they weren’t lucky enough to find a salt block to lick every day! I read one comment about someone who has had good results from “the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water”. I would challenge him and others to just try the lemon juice with water. I find that if I clean myself out with just one glass of lemon-water once a week, it has had a splendid effect on my health. The other ingredients may help, but it would be an interesting experiment for you. So I, like, many, many others, am sensitive to salt. Maybe some people can eat a huge amount of salt on a regular basis with no adverse health effects. That is not true for many of us, and it is offensive when so called “professionals” or “scientists” dispute this. One thing I always tell my patients, “When it comes to your health, trust yourself above all others”. If you are convinced a particular medication is making you feel sick, and your doctor or pharmacist imply it’s all in your head, trust yourself, not them. If you, like me, feel a thousand times better when you limit your consumption of salt or processed foods, then please, keep doing what you are doing, and don’t listen to those who suggest otherwise! You will be healthier and happier. Thanks for listening, my friends from far away.<br/>While it’s certainly possible that you are salt sensitive, when you decided to alter your diet, you changed many other things in addition to how much salt you ate. Two of the easiest ways to lower blood pressure without altering salt are 1. lose weight. 2. eat more veggies and fruits (aka foods rich in potassium). Numerous clinical and observational studies have shown that the sodium-potassium ratio is likely more important than how much sodium you eat. [Note that this only applies to the 99.999999% of humanity who eats between 3k and 6k mgs of sodium a day. Salt probably is a problem if you’re eating way out of the normal range, like 12,000mg + of sodium a day.]<br/>I was going to basically say the same thing. I had high blood pressure… I did a 30 day Paleo Challenge… All clean from the earth foods. I actually increased my salt intake by introducing a lot of salty beef jerky and pickled food into my diet for snacking. Not only did my blood pressure end up near perfect… I also lost 16 pounds. I wasn’t even someone you would really consider over weight to begin with… 178 lbs to 162 lbs in 30 days. My weird headaches were gone… the whole nine yards that come with high blood pressure. I’m convinced the salt and blood pressure are not related… and I think its a cop out to people who really need to get on an actual healthy diet.<br/>This article is dangerous and might convince someone to use all the salt they want. But all I have to do is eat a couple of big bags of Potato chips and I am getting 180/90 within a couple of days, stay off the salt then for 3-4 days and hydrate well, back to 130/70. Now “maybe” I am hypersensitive, but since this has repeated a half dozen times, I avoid salt. There is plenty in normal foods/<br/>Looks like you dont know what you are talking about… read Curt Nicol DD PhD entry below. and read again this article… you’ve been biased by exposure to the doctors who got biased by years and years of all the yada..yada..yada… read the article again. Of course, you are not going to start eating salt by the pound… everything would taste awful anyway.<br/>What is dangerous is advice and treatments with no scientific basis based on hypothesis alone, the collateral effect of reducing most peoples regular salt intakes is eating less processed food containing huge amounts of refined or simple carbs, highly oxidation prone oils, denatured substances, contaminants and additives.<br/>Reducing these will lead to improved overall nutrition.<br/>Limiting salt on its own with no other variables will show little to no effect in most people and can be detrimental to others.<br/>Me to. I’ve entered a detail comment of stop and start tests that 100% proved my hypothesis that Na was one of the large contributors to blood pressure. Takes an effort to document and record methods and result. Mine was as high as 205/115. I got it down to a consistent 100/65 for two years. My work is documented in this comment section but has yet to show up.<br/>A lot of people here saying that eating a bag of chips increases their blood pressure. Do they not realize it isn’t a health food? Do they think it possibly doesn’t contain all the wrong stuff?<br/>There has to be some other high sodium food they can use to show how salt affects their blood pressure.<br/>That’s right… what is bad is the oil and grease that is going the the pipes and constraining them… plus potato chips, it’s all starch, which turns to sugar, then fat …<br/>I would not be credulous enough to think for a minute, that salt is NOT related to high blood pressure, and increased body temperatures, for it certainly DOES. I reduced my 160 over 80 blood pressure down to 119 over 81 in a few weeks by cutting my salt intake severely. Why is it everytime I eat a several servings of potato chips, or eat Mc Donald’s french fries, I get immediately face flushed and feverish? I have even felt and heard, yes, the constricted veins in my own head, after having high blood pressure, dilate, expand, and break open again,after drinking cups, and cups of water, with the disappearance of the fever, disappearance of discomfort or congested head feeling, and reduced blood pressure.<br/>This really bothers me, and I have t confess to being somewhat confused now. I LOVE salt and can consume more in a single meal than you are supposed to consume in a day. It never seemed to affect my b.p.<br/>Then when my b.p. started increasing as I got older, my doc said to cut out salt. So I did…with no real effect. I was actually admitted into hospital with a serious infection, only to find that when I was discharged, I had been kept on a low sodium diet, even though on admission, my sodium level was dangerously low.<br/>This all made me believe that the dangers of sodium were only a myth, at least for me anyway. But then my wife got ill. Her b.p. was being constantly monitored as it kept going too low. They used to inject her with “sodium” (salty water I believe) and her blood pressure would come up almost immediately. This was intravenously however.<br/>So is it that I’m not salt-sensitive, or is it something about the stomach that acts a s barrier (so ingested salt does not affect you), while IV salt will?<br/>For something that is so fundamental in medical advice, it is so frustrating that there seems to be so little research, at least quality research done on it.<br/>Conversely, on a later admission to hospital, they had me on low sodium again (once and idiot puts it on your medical records, it seems impossible to get it off…) and gave me a blood pressure reducing medication. My b.p. dropped through the floor and was worrying them at one stage.<br/>BP medications are not evidenced to improve outcomes or be safe in most situations. Modern medicine is quite dangerous they kill people constantly with what they prescribe.<br/>Your wife may have kidney and adrenal problems while you more likely have vascular problems. Consider the possible environmental causes, you drink water with fluoride that increases absorption of lead, lack of antioxidants like ala, vit a/e/c/d/k2 can lead to increased oxidative stress arterial sclerosis and calcification of arteries restricting the ability of vessals to dialate, increased irritant exposure raises vasoconstriction and coagulation by increased seratonin release and lower amounts of nitric oxide produced by endothelial damage, low vitamin c leads to lessened collagen synthesis as does raised cortisol levels, both lead to poor circulation.<br/>These things can cause problems anywhere.<br/>I just spent an hour writing up a comment. My doctor wishes to see it. I doe not show up. What is going on? Did I waste my time? Please respond.<br/>Excellent article. Articles of this type bring out the health nutters and know-it-alls….just take a look at the comments. This also reminds me of the “global warming”….”climate change” (or whatever they are calling it this week) “experts” who preach it like it was gospel when they too have no definitive proof. | Факт або міф: натрій підвищує кров'яний тиск<br/>Що ж, Метт, виявляється, що дієта з високим вмістом натрію не може підвищити кров'яний тиск і взагалі не мати ніякого негативного впливу на серцево-судинне здоров'я. Але я розкрию теорію про те, чому сіль підвищує кров'яний тиск нижче - просто зрозумійте, що це просто теорія, і вона не підтверджена більшою частиною будь-яких вагомі наукові докази (і є більше доказів, які говорять, що це не так, ніж робить).<br/>Дебати про вживання занадто багато солі були навколо з 1960-х років. Майже кожна велика урядова організація охорони здоров'я приймає ідею, що вживання занадто багато солі шкодить вашому здоров'ю. Більшість великих новинних агентств повідомляють про ці рекомендації, і люди, як правило, намагаються дотримуватися їх. Це, швидше за все, тому більшість з нас, особливо літніх людей з проблемами серця, знають, щоб зменшити кількість солі, яку ми їмо. Ті з нас, кому подобається ідея, що будь-яка рекомендація підкріплюється твердими доказами, повинні відступити від цього. Як зазначалося, в даний час немає твердих доказів того, що сіль хронічно підвищить кров'яний тиск. Так, немає.<br/>Так чому ж більшість організацій охорони здоров'я висунули ідею дієти з низьким вмістом натрію? Теорія, що стоїть за їх припущенням, є здоровою, і є деякі дослідження, які показують незначний ризик підвищеного кров'яного тиску з надзвичайно високим споживанням солі. На жаль, є багато інших досліджень, які не показують збільшення, і все ще деякі, які показують зниження споживання солі може насправді підвищити кров'яний тиск! Давайте подивимося на суперечку більш докладно.<br/>Ідея солі підвищити кров'яний тиск пов'язана з осмотичним тиском. Осмос — переміщення розчинника (в даному випадку води) через напівпроникні мембрани (як клітинні стінки), від зон з нижчою концентрацією розчину (в даному випадку солі) до зон з вищою концентрацією розчину. Це природно вирівнює концентрацію розчинених речовин з обох сторін мембрани. (Цей осмотичний тиск також є причиною того, що сіль може бути використана для збереження м'яса.)<br/>Отже, теорія стверджує, що коли ми їмо занадто багато солі, наш кровотік має більше натрію, ніж навколишні області нашого тіла. Це призводить до того, що вода в цих областях втягується в наш кровотік. Збільшення води в артеріях і венах викликає збільшення тиску в цих артеріях і венах. Сама сіль також діє як подразник в артеріях, змушуючи їх звужуватися. Вважається, що це також підвищує кров'яний тиск.<br/>Теорія здається, на поверхні, дуже звук. Зрештою, ми можемо зробити процес солі тягне воду через мембрани відбувається знову і знову в лабораторії. Питання в тому, чи дійсно це відбувається в нашому організмі, і чи дійсно це викликає довгострокову гіпертонію (високий кров'яний тиск)?<br/>У 1969 році Льюїс Дал свідчив перед «вибраним комітетом з харчування та потреб людини» сенатора Джорджа Макговерна. Він був стурбований високими концентраціями натрію в дитячому харчуванні і думав, що це може призвести до збільшення артеріального тиску людей в довгостроковій перспективі. Його аргументація полягала в тому, що дослідження, проведені на щурах, показали підвищення кров'яного тиску у щурів.<br/>Розмова про сіль і гіпертонію почала циркулювати серед організацій охорони здоров'я. Національні інститути здоров'я, в 1972 році, почав введення "Високий артеріальний тиск освітніх програм". Як свої докази, вони вказали спостережливо, популяції, які їли дуже мало натрію, мали низькі випадки високого кров'яного тиску. Вони також вказали на моделювання щурів. Вчені в той час поставили це під сумнів, так як дослідження на щурах показали, що вони їдять в 60 разів більше, ніж середня людина. Вони також вказали на популяції, які їли дієти з низьким вмістом натрію, а також їли низьку кількість інших речей, таких як цукор (який також впливає на осмос).<br/>Незважаючи на їх заперечення, публічно, ідея дієти з високим вмістом натрію, що викликає високий кров'яний тиск, була тут, щоб залишитися, і залишається сьогодні. Центри з контролю за захворюваннями, Національні інститути здоров'я, Американська кардіологічна асоціація та багато інших організацій в даний час пропагують дієти з низьким вмістом натрію.<br/>Незважаючи на, здавалося б, єдиний фронт, представлений цими видатними організаціями, полеміка серед вчених надзвичайно запекла. У 1998 році нагороджений автор Таубес опублікував «Політологію солі» в Journal of Science. Він заявив: «Суперечка про переваги, якщо такі є, скорочення солі зараз є однією з найдовше діючих найбільш гострих і сюрреалістичних суперечок у всій медицині».<br/>Один генеральний хірург у звіті написав, що швидкість, з якою федеральні агентства США прийняли зниження рівня натрію, «стояла в різкому контрасті з тим, скільки часу знадобилося для рекомендацій щодо важливості зниження рівня холестерину в крові». Він також зазначив, що різниця була ще більш помітною, враховуючи відсутність опублікованих досліджень, які фактично перевіряли теорію. З іншого боку, сер Майкл Ролінгс, голова Національного інституту здоров'я та клінічної досконалості, який пропагує дієти скорочення солі, стверджував, що «Керівництво (у формуванні політики) базується на найкращих наявних доказах. Однак докази можуть бути не дуже хорошими і рідко повними». Не дуже сильний аргумент на користь зменшення споживання солі.<br/>Давайте подивимося на кілька відносно недавніх досліджень. У 2008 році італійські дослідники почали публікувати результати серії клінічних випробувань, всі з яких повідомили, що серед пацієнтів з серцевою недостатністю зниження споживання солі підвищує ризик смерті. За цими дослідженнями слідували інші, які показали, що серед діабетиків 1 і 2 типу, здорових європейців і пацієнтів з хронічною серцевою недостатністю ті, хто їв сіль на нижній межі нормального діапазону, були більш схильні до серцевих захворювань, ніж ті, хто їв сіль в середньому діапазоні норми.<br/>У 2011 році в двох Кокрейнових оглядах не було виявлено жодних доказів того, що дієти з низьким вмістом солі покращують або погіршують здоров'я людей. Вони заявили: «Після більш ніж 150 випадкових клінічних випробувань і 13 популяційних досліджень без очевидного сигналу на користь зменшення натрію, інша позиція може полягати в тому, щоб прийняти, що такий сигнал може не існувати».<br/>Навіть незважаючи на відсутність чітких наукових доказів, що підтверджують це, а деякі навпаки, у 2010 році Центри з контролю та профілактики захворювань, Інститут медицини та Американське товариство гіпертонії продовжували просувати дієти з низьким вмістом натрію як засіб контролю високого кров'яного тиску.<br/>Зрештою, будучи медичним працівником і тим, хто потребує чітких доказів, щоб прийняти рішення про те, чи можу я додати велику кількість солі на картоплі фрі, я радий виявити, що поки що їх дуже мало! Всі основні організації охорони здоров'я, схоже, пропагують дієти з низьким вмістом натрію, але жоден з них не опублікував послідовних досліджень, які показують, що дієти з низьким вмістом натрію допомагають здоров'ю, особливо серцево-судинному здоров'ю. Найбільше мене дратує те, що жодна з цих організацій не говорить людям, що наука, яка стоїть за їх політикою, є спірною, і вони можуть бути абсолютно неправі. Рональд Байєр, Девід Меррітт Джонс, і Сандро Галеа сказали, що це найкраще у своїй статті "Сіль і громадське здоров'я" - "Після ретельного розгляду дискусії про сіль, ми прийшли до висновку, що приховування наукової невизначеності є помилкою, яка не служить ні цілям науки, ні хорошій політиці".<br/>Отже, ви повинні вийти і задушити все в солі зараз? Як і з більшістю речей, якщо наука не змогла відповісти на питання остаточно так чи інакше, і ви хочете бути в безпеці, а не шкодувати, просто йти зі стародавнім правилом "поміркованість у всьому". Якщо ви, як і я, любите солити все, як обод склянки Маргарити і помірність, будь проклятий, принаймні, тепер ви можете відчувати себе трохи краще про це, оскільки наука, здається, все більше і більше схиляється до дієти з низьким вмістом натрію, які непотрібні, а високі натрію не шкідливі взагалі.<br/>Якщо вам сподобалася ця стаття та бонусні факти нижче, вам також може сподобатися:<br/>Чому сіль покращує смак<br/>Що означають цифри в тесті на артеріальний тиск і що вони говорять лікарю<br/>Що змушує руки, ноги і ноги «заснути»<br/>Топ-5 порад першої допомоги, які повинен знати кожен<br/>Як видалити свіжий килим з нічого, крім солі<br/>- Високий кров'яний тиск сам по собі не є хворобою. Це просто фактор ризику для інших проблем. Наприклад, якщо у вас хронічний високий кров'яний тиск, ваш ризик серцевого нападу або інсульту значно зростає. Цей високий тиск може бути викликаний надмірним нальоту на внутрішній стінці артерії, що робить ці артерії, по суті, меншими. Подумайте про сантехніку. Коли труби, які транспортують рідину, стають меншими, тиск того ж обсягу рідини збільшується. Що станеться, якщо ваш кров'яний тиск стає занадто високим? Я відповім на це питання іншим. Що станеться, якщо тиск води в ваших будинках труби стає занадто високим? Ваші труби лопнули. Те ж саме тут. Якщо ваш кров'яний тиск стає занадто високим, ваші артерії мають більше шансів розірватися. Якщо всередині ваших труб занадто багато пістолетів (наліт всередині ваших артерій), ця куля пістолетів може стати занадто великою і забити ваші труби! Здається, погано теж мені! Особливо, якщо ці артерії знаходяться у вашому мозку або серці. Це не як нирки, де у вас є два! Ви витікаєте в цих органах, і ваша сім'я, нарешті, отримує цю велику зарплату від вашого поліс страхування життя! Не зовсім найкращий спосіб отримати зарплату, ну, якщо ви дійсно придурок, і всі у вашій сім'ї ненавидять вас! Тоді вони можуть не так сильно заперечувати, але ви, безумовно, буде.<br/>- Артеріальний тиск вимірюється в міліметрах ртутного стовпа. Для довідки, 1 фунт на квадратний дюйм дорівнює 51,7149326 міліметрів ртутного стовпа. Якщо ви були кровотеча і хотів зупинити кров-втрата з прямим тиском, і ви повинні, вам потрібно буде тільки використовувати близько 3 фунтів на квадратний дюйм, щоб зупинити його. Якщо вони мають дійсно високий кров'яний тиск, то, можливо, 4 фунт на квадратний дюйм. Базова математика зберігає день знову!<br/>Перший відомий експеримент з вимірювання точного тиску крові був проведений Стівеном Хейлзом 1 грудня 1733 року. Він взяв живого коня. Прикріпив трубку до її лівої криволінійної артерії, потім дозволив її крові побігти по трубці, і вона піднялася на висоту 8'3". Він зазначив, що "коли вона була на повній висоті, вона піднімалася і падала при і після кожного пульсу 2, 3, або 4 дюйми". Так, кінь истек кров'ю, але не думайте, що містер Хейлз був занадто жорстоким, він провів експеримент на коні, який мав бути поставлений в будь-якому випадку! Для коня, я впевнений, що ця відмінність не мала великого значення, звичайно.<br/>* Юридична відмова: Хоча я медичний працівник, ця стаття містить загальну інформацію про медичні умови та лікування.

Розгорнути для посилань<br/>Ділимося знаннями!<br/>Я все більше і більше переконаний, що сіль дійсно значно підвищує мій АД. Всякий раз, коли я їм чипси (чіпси, якщо ви живете в США), які мають досить велику кількість солі, мій АД значно підвищується в наступні кілька днів.<br/>Я спробував отримати безсольові чипси близько тижня тому і додав свою власну «ло-соль» (замінник солі, що складається з хлориду калію і хлориду натрію (соль), але вдвічі більше, ніж перший, ніж останній).<br/>У будь-якому випадку, чипси з ароматом солі не підвищують мій АД взагалі.<br/>Гаразд, я знаю, що потрібні подальші експерименти на собі. Але на даний момент я сильно підозрюю, що сіль є винуватцем. Я також підозрюю, що цукор збільшує моє АД. Але багато досліджень потрібно, щоб встановити це!<br/>Можливо, у вас поганий баланс калію до натрію. Моя мама має гіпертонію і була на дієті з низьким вмістом натрію, але вона не отримувала достатньо калію, і її кров'яний тиск не був стабільним. Якщо ви стурбовані, ви можете перевірити рівень калію в крові.<br/>Тепер, коли вона споживає достатньо калію, її кров'яний тиск був нормальним протягом року, споживаючи натрій у нормальних межах (понад 2500 мг).<br/>Це не натрій... Це жир і крохмаль, який робить вас жирніше і жирніше; і це, ви маса тіла збільшується і робить його важче для вашого серця, щоб прокачати кров через вени і артерії, які отримують стиснуті в вашому тілі збільшеною кількістю накопиченого жиру.<br/>ви їсте чистий кривавий крохмаль і вказуючи на сіль замість цукру, все, щоб уникнути інкримінації цукру, не згадуйте рослинне масло, яке збільшує всі причини смерті. Ви отримуєте набагато більше осмолярності від цукру<br/>Необхідні вагомі докази? Не міф і дуже легко документувати — вимагає мало інтелекту або підготовки, це може зробити кожен. У віці 52-54 років це було протягом двох років (2005 і 2006). Використовував програмне забезпечення (Diet Power 4 - я заплатив 50 доларів за нього, але тепер його можна безкоштовно завантажити), щоб відстежувати час тренування їжі, натрію та велосипеда. Виготовлені графіки з використанням методу ручки і паперу, хоча будуть робити те ж саме, оскільки програма не мала ніяких положень для введення даних про артеріальний тиск. Лікар, який приймає читання кожні три-шість місяців, абсолютно не має значення, на мою думку, якщо не докладається зусиль, щоб взяти читання за тих же обставин, крім того, щоб показати загальну тенденцію протягом декількох років.<br/>Я виявив, що, щоб мати будь-яке значення, для мого типу графіка і гіпотези (тепер доведено), необхідно було взяти кілька показань протягом періоду не менше п'яти хвилин або до двох близьких (три або менше чисельного поширення і не більше трьох ударів в хвилину на серцевий ритм) показань. Я хотів би взяти до уваги показання після двох миль ходьби або годину їзди на велосипеді на повільній до помірної швидкості. Широкі гойдалки протягом п’яти хвилин кинути після того, як я став у фізичній формі і залишився на дієті. Професійні сайти рекомендують сидіти 3 хвилини або більше і приймати більше, ніж одне читання, але у мене був тільки один або два лікарі за останні двадцять років, які роблять це, деякі через необхідність швидкого огляду іншого пацієнта. Медсестра стверджувала, що основною причиною для вимірювання артеріального тиску були страхові компанії, які наполягали на цьому. Вона стверджувала, що деякі лікарі не дивилися на показання, які вона брала, так що хто піклується, якщо зусилля були зроблені, щоб отримати точне читання був її висновок.<br/>Увійти після поспішаючи, щоб з'явитися вчасно, піднімаючись по сходах або що-небудь, сісти, медсестра хапає вашу руку і приймає ваш кров'яний тиск. Одного разу я переконав лікаря взяти друге читання після десяти хвилин обговорення зі мною моїх медичних проблем. Він стверджував, що рідко чекав, чоловік з 15-річним досвідом, хоча професійні сайти рекомендували чекати три хвилини. Інший лікар стверджував, що він ніколи не чув про те, що Na впливає на артеріальний тиск (він був армійським лікарем з різними стандартами освіти, які він стверджував).<br/>Тепер до результатів. Графіки були прекрасними і показали ідеальну коаліцію між п'ятьма введеними факторами: тип їжі, кількість натрію, вправи, частота серцевих скорочень, вага.<br/>Я був на ліки від артеріального тиску протягом десяти років з лише чисельною зміною 5. Я також був у сидячій зайнятості і отримав нуль вправ. Моя вага була на верхньому кінці нормальної ваги або трохи надмірна вага. Я хотів би їсти типові кількості натрію для американців (2000 + мг) протягом двох днів. Потім різні кількості низького натрію протягом 4 днів, а потім поступово збільшуватися протягом декількох днів. Після 72 годин дієти з низьким вмістом натрію та програми вправ, мій кров'яний тиск значно знизиться. 135/90 до 110/70 протягом трьох днів було типовим після того, як я був на моєму плані дієти (дієта DASH) протягом одного місяця. Рівень цукру та високі хімічні продукти також були зареєстровані як частина дієти. Споживання натрію показало більше, ніж інші вправи, як найбільша змінна. Високі хімічні продукти також показали різницю, хоча високі хімічні продукти часто мають високі рівні натрію.<br/>Протягом чотирьох днів після відновлення дієти DASH відбудеться значна і поступова зміна вгору. Це займає два або більше днів, в залежності від фізичної активності і споживання води, щоб розсіяти натрій у вашій крові моя гіпотеза, хоча я ніколи не підтверджував це з дослідження.<br/>Я підозрюю, що рівні натрію для належного кров'яного тиску змінюються між людьми та різними конструкціями тіла (гендер, раса, активність, жир проти худих, рівень вправ тощо). Багато людей можуть мати невеликий ефект від 2000 мг проти 600 мг Na. Я не один з них. Передбачається, що печерні люди мали дієту від 400 до 600 мг Na. Те, що було досить добре для печерних людей (які мали коротке життя з інших причин), було досить добре для мене.<br/>Мені довелося докласти зусиль, щоб залишитися на 600 мг через мою дієту. Дієта, на якій я був на 200 до 400 мг, якщо я не змусив себе використовувати цей соляний шейкер). Натрій є необхідною частиною вашої дієти. Я виявив, що кількість Na понад 1000 мг було занадто багато для мого тіла. У мене гіпертонія і серцебиття з задишком. Мої лабораторні показники щитовидної залози стали ідеальними, і лікар взяв мене від тиреоїдних ліків і ліків від артеріального тиску. Моя паліація серця і задишка в 3 до 5 ранку кожну ніч кинути після одного місяця. Всі мої проблеми відновилися значно, коли я вийшов з моєї дієти / вправи в останні роки. Один старший лікар, який був у професії протягом сорока років, стверджував, що я був лише одним з двох людей, які перейшли від рівня ТТГ 0,0 до 4,0 (верхній діапазон норми) після відмови від ліків. Проблеми з щитовидною залозою відновилися разом з артеріальним тиском, серцевим і серцевим паліативом. Тепер я відновив план дієти та фізичних вправ та відстеження. Я відправлю оновлення через три місяці.<br/>Я лише одна людина, тому помістіть 400 людей на ту ж програму, на якій я був, і подивіться, що станеться. Проблема, звичайно, знайти 200 чесних людей з цих 400, які не фіб на дієті і вправи бази даних або здогадатися. Це також вимагає сили волі, щоб дотримуватися програми. Я застряг з ним протягом десяти років, а потім кинути з різних причин. Видалити ті з бази даних, які не показують ніяких поліпшень, які відмовляються присягати під присягою і приймати тест на детекторі брехні!<br/>Сіль (натрію) підвищує кров'яний тиск. Я пішов до лікаря, і мій кров'яний тиск був 130/90. Вона сказала мені контролювати мою сіль (обмеження натрію 1500 мг), і я мав перевірку через два дні з моїм кров'яним тиском 108/87. Кожен раз, коли я їм багато солоної їжі, я отримую сплеск в моєму тиску. Я, безумовно, сіль чутлива.<br/>Сіль (SODIUM) впливає на кров'яний тиск. Ви повинні бути обережні (вона підкрадається до вас добре) і налаштувати свій раціон, щоб обмежити споживання натрію і стежити за ознаками вашого підвищення тиску. Особливо, коли ваша поведінка тіла змінюється.<br/>Тренуйтеся також! Якщо ви ліниві або не настільки активні, займіть 30 хвилин ходьби 5 днів на тиждень (150 хвилин), щоб отримати гідну вправу.<br/>Я думаю, що рекомендувати дієту з низьким вмістом натрію, яка, можливо, впливає на певну групу людей, тих, хто вже має гіпертонію і чутливий до солі, для всього населення смішно. Інший момент полягає в тому, чи призводить високий рівень споживання солі до хронічних серцево-судинних проблем, які рекламуються як факт для громадськості, але не має досліджень, щоб підтримати це. Я споживаю набагато більше натрію, ніж рекомендує CDC, і мій BP ніколи не був вище, ніж 117/70, мій найвищий коли-небудь, нормальний близько 100-110/65-70. Жоден з наших випадків не доводить, так чи інакше, вплив "високого" споживання натрію на загальну популяцію.<br/>У вас може бути низький клітинний калій, високий рівень міді, низький рівень вітаміну K2, низький рівень магнію, низький рівень вітаміну Е, токсичність важких металів, таких як свинець, всі піддаються впливу свинцю та фториду, ці речі з'єднуються один з одним.<br/>Подивіться на умови, які викликають у вас цю чутливість до солі, наприклад, низький рівень калію з високим рівнем кортизолу.<br/>Не просто відпочивайте на солі, тому що у вас, ймовірно, буде багато проблем, а також майже ніхто не їсть сіль сам по собі.<br/>Сіль, як правило, міститься у високому простому цукрі без харчових волокон з добавками.<br/>Розуміти керівні принципи для всього населення не тільки для вас, це проблематично, тому що нерафінована сіль не є шкідливою для більшості людей, а для деяких вона покращує здоров'я і робить ці рекомендації без визнання біохімічної індивідуальності.<br/>Зрозумійте, зниження HBP не все і кінець всього, це було механічно зроблено препаратами в дослідженнях, які не показують поліпшення результатів і навіть погіршення симптомів за межами ознаки вимірювання АД.<br/>Що потрібно враховувати, екстракт оливкового листя, вітамін Е, вітамін С, вітамін К2, калій, куркумін, стевія (натуральний підсолоджувач), магній, помеграніт, l-аргінін, наттокіназа, риб'ячий жир, какао, буряк, альфа-ліпоєва кислота, бромелайн, насіння льону, селера, кок10, насіння льону, hawthorne. Все це покращує АД і серцево-судинні проблеми. У вас набагато більше інструментів, ніж ви думаєте<br/>Що стосується цукру, жінки повинні обмежити свій цукор (Загальні вуглеводи є те, що має значення і стежити за певними цукровими спиртами) 20г-30г закуски і 30г-45г кожен прийом їжі. Чоловіки повинні тримати свої закуски так само, як жінки 20г-30г закуски і 60г - 75г їжі. Найнижчі цифри, звичайно, є лімітом для діабетиків.<br/>Я вважаю, що деякі люди мають чутливість до натрію. Я переконаний, що я роблю. Після того, як на 3 різних ліки BP в один час і все ще має неконтрольовану гіпертонію, я почав читати етикетки їжі і різко зменшити споживання натрію. Більшість оброблених харчових продуктів завантажені натрієм. Мені вдалося повністю припинити прийом 2 препаратів і зменшити третю до 1/4 призначеної дози. Для мене зменшення натрію мало величезну різницю. Минулої ночі я прийняв 10 мг лізиноприлу, що становить 1/4 від призначеної добової дози. Сьогодні мій АД занадто низький, 105/48. Я дійсно повинен постійно контролювати його, оскільки низький АД також не дуже весело.<br/>Ліки від артеріального тиску неефективні, вони не в змозі поліпшити результати тільки читання АД.<br/>Ви зменшили споживання продуктів з низьким вмістом калію з високим вмістом солі з високим вмістом цукру з низьким вмістом клітковини, це завжди призводило до зниження кров'яного тиску.<br/>Сіль - це не ворог, вам просто потрібно калій і антиоксиданти, щоб збалансувати його і знизити стрес.<br/>Коли люди зменшують натрій таким чином, ви не можете внести його в саму сіль, ви повністю змінили своє дієтичне споживання багатьох речей, ось як людей можна обдурити, вважаючи, що це одна річ.<br/>Це приписування єдиної причини проблем постійно робиться в гіпотезі, і вони, як правило, повністю демонізують особливі речі, такі як Co2, сіль, насичені жири, холестерин, відсутність сератоніну, навіть відсутність використання отрути фторидів.<br/>Це всі міфи, які не піддаються перевірці, але продовжують підтримуватися як причини регулюючими органами шляхом вибору вишні та відхилення мінімізації переважаючих суперечностей. Фармацевтичні корпорації нездорової їжі та рослинних олій отримують вигоду та дезінформують громадськість заради прибутку, до якої FDA рекетує для них, вбиваючи їх конкуренцію.<br/>Дослідження в галузі медицини та багато інших досліджень є вигребною ямою інцестуозного обману між приватними інтересами та стимулюванням економіки, а також політиками, лікарями та державними прибутками.<br/>Редактори журналів дослідження опубліковані в знайти більшість досліджень, щоб бути повністю відсутні, висновки, щоб бути розкручені в бік підтвердження упередженості і що ми знаходимося в досить темну епоху для науки, де віра, консенсус і рецензування менше про хорошу науку і більше про чорний м'яч конкуруючі переконання і докази, які будуть шкодити прибутку і майбутні гранти.<br/>Так, будь-що. Вірте, що ви хочете. Я читав книги про здоров'я протягом багатьох років .... DECADES ... і я прочитав в них ТОЧНО те, що надруковано в цій статті. НІКОЛИ не було доведеного зв'язку між сіллю і високим кров'яним тиском. Крім того, в одній з книг він зазначив, що сіль використовується для виробництва шлункової кислоти, і іронічно, що з віком дієта з низьким вмістом натрію, яку так часто рекламують, призводить до проблем з травленням.<br/>Тримайте віруючих лікарів, які беруть 3 кредити харчування в коледжі і смоли сполуки, які викликають гірші побічні ефекти, ніж фактичне захворювання.<br/>Лікарі, які кажуть, що хіропрактика - це "не справжня медицина". Прочитайте документи Вінсдора. Лікар, який вирішив довести, що Chiro був підробкою, зробивши аутопсію, виявив, що 99 з 100 несправностей органів були пов'язані з нестачею нервової енергії, викликаної «підвищеннями», які защемлюють нерви і переривають нервовий потік енергії. (Я не маніпулятор).<br/>Прочитайте книги Нормана Вокера, (особливо "Свіжі фрукти та овочі."), TC Фрай, і Герберт М. Шелтон (Superior Nutrition, Голодування може врятувати ваше життя).

Мій, я люблю солі ,<br/>Ця стаття вводить в оману. Просто тому, що негативний вплив солі на артеріальний тиск є "теорією", не означає, що ми повинні ігнорувати його. Насправді більшість медицини та науки здійснюється на правдоподібних теоріях. Правда полягає в тому, що дієта з низьким вмістом солі менш шкідлива, ніж дієта з високим вмістом солі, і, як і всі речі, справжня мораль історії - поміркованість. Також цей автор суперечить собі, кажучи, що немає ніяких доказів ... Так немає", щоб підтримати цю теорію, але потім продовжує цитувати принаймні одне дослідження, яке показує негативний corrolatuon у людей, а інший за участю щурів. Це докази, принаймні деякі ні один. Більшість медицини чорна магія, і багато лікарів визнають це. Звичайно, іноді ми далеко не знаємо, але в цьому випадку є достатньо науки за впливом солей на ВР, щоб зробити його варто розглянути. Також пам'ятайте, що споживання людиною високих кількостей солі є досить новою річчю в еволюційному масштабі, тому її вплив на наш організм є досить неприродним.<br/>Майк: "Немає доказів... Так, немає" Я думаю, що Скотт має на увазі "Немає достовірних доказів" або, скоріше, "Немає доказів, які не є хибними".<br/>"Все в міру" Так, точно. Як любить говорити Скотт, "Навіть вода вб'є вас у досить високих дозах." Він навіть одного разу розповів мені історію про жінку, яку він намагався лікувати від цієї самої речі - вона випила величезну кількість води і в кінцевому підсумку померла від цього.<br/>"Більшість медицини - це чорна магія, і багато лікарів визнають це". Я не думаю, що будь-які лікарі коли-небудь скажуть це. Можливо, століття або два тому. Але в ці дні тут є дивовижна кількість хорошої науки. Ми далекі від того, щоб знати все, але це, безумовно, не чорна магія або просто здогадуватися про роботу, як це, здавалося б, мається на увазі.<br/>Вибачте за незгоду з вами Дейв. Але навіть на джерелах відео підйом артеріального тиску на дієтах з високим вмістом солі очевидний. При цьому в кінці одного з них, поки говорять про м'якінапої і закуски компанії:<br/>Деякі з цих компаній були видатними в спробах створити штучну суперечку, сумніваючись у зв'язку між споживанням солі і артеріальним тиском, імовірно в надії зупинити або сповільнити будь-яке скорочення споживання солі населення, щоб захистити продаж безалкогольних напоїв.<br/>Навіть, я не фахівець в цій області, відсутність огляду літератури в джерелі з цього питання тривожить.<br/>дієти, які є обробленими продуктами з низьким вмістом жирів і високим вмістом цукру, обсерваційні дослідження не мають сенсу, ці люди їдять велику кількість цукру щороку. Якщо ви думаєте, що корпорації намагаються дозволити використовувати більше солі, це безглузде відволікання на що-небудь, щоб не дивитися на епідемію синдрому цукрового метаболізму.<br/>Наскільки придурковано, що ви думаєте, що обсерваційні дослідження мають значення для чогось іншого, ніж пропонування гіпотези, ви потім використовуєте втручання та подвійні сліпі плацебо-дослідження без змінних, щоб довести їх причинно-наслідкову силу. Це не робиться, це також не робиться для холестерину або насичених жирів. Ви довірлива жертва патологічної науки, коли він каже, що немає ніяких доказів, що немає ніяких доказів, що спостережні дослідження не контролюють нічого, що вони не є експериментом, це не те, як працює наука. Ви розумієте, що cochrane є, мабуть, найбільш нейтральною групою для клінічних досліджень у світі, і вони переглянули 150 випробувань та 13 популяційних досліджень. Тут ви кажете, що їх висновки неправильні на основі чого? Ніщо інше, як ваша віра, заснована на гіпотезі без доказів.<br/>Я пропоную вам прочитати книгу "Сіль". Це в основному геополітичний історичний опис солі в нашій цивілізації, але в ньому також є багато науки. Ми побудували нашу цивілізацію на солі.<br/>У першому абзаці говориться: «просто усвідомлюйте, що це просто теорія, і вона не підкріплена більшою частиною будь-яких твердих наукових доказів», я вважаю, що, оскільки це науковий веб-сайт, він не повинен використовувати слово теорія в цьому контексті, оскільки в науці теорія є прийнятним поясненням явища, доведеним шляхом тестування.<br/>Так, він повинен був використати гіпотезу. Я збираюся подивитися на історію теорії і подивитися, якщо хтось знає, як це закінчилося з двома такими різними значеннями.<br/>Для медичного працівника (що призводить до припущення про вищу освіту), у вас є жахливе розуміння граматики та правопису. Це дискредитує багато з того, що ви говорите, на мій погляд. Наявність когось іншого переглянути вашу роботу перед публікацією буде пройти довгий шлях.<br/>Я буду продовжувати слухати свого кардіолога з цього питання і обмежити споживання солі.<br/>Марк: Щось ви знайдете, здавалося б, вірно про велику кількість медичних працівників, стереотип про те, що їх почерк жахливий, як правило, правильний. (Скотт особливо поганий.) І їх технічне написання також іноді може бути особливо жахливим, перед редагуванням. (Вони вивчають медицину і людське тіло, не пишучи, врешті-решт) Але, в більш ніж 100 + статей Скотт написав, він ніколи не був показаний, щоб бути неправильним на головній точці (і тільки кілька випадків бути неправильним на незначній точці). Tipos? Незручне речення? Ви завжди знайдете хоча б одну з них в кожній з його статей, незважаючи на мої найщиріші зусилля, щоб позбутися їх всіх. Але врешті-решт, я піклуюся про точність набагато більше, ніж граматика. Обидва було б добре, але знайти письменника з особливим досвідом Скотта і здатністю критично мислити і обробляти величезні обсяги медичних знань надзвичайно важко. Ці люди не є ні копійки дюжини.<br/>Але насправді, сила аргументів Скотта ніколи не базується на його великих медичних знаннях. Це просто допомагає йому ретельно перевіряти різні дослідження на тему, де більшість загубиться в термінології, не кажучи вже про те, щоб критично думати про них і їх методології. Сила аргументу - самі дослідження. У цьому, ви б добре, щоб насправді прочитати два Кокрейн відгуки, і, можливо, переслати їх до вашого кардіолога для його / її думки.<br/>Не дивуйтеся, якщо він / вона вже підготував їх, хоча, і, можливо, навіть погоджується з ними. Те, що лікарі говорять своїм пацієнтам, не завжди відповідає тому, що вони насправді знають або вважають правдою. Особливо в таких випадках, коли судові процеси можуть бути дуже реальною можливістю, якщо вони сказали вам їсти всю сіль, яку ви хотіли, тоді ви померли від проблеми з серцем (але не маючи нічого спільного з сіллю), тоді ваша сім'я подає до суду на них і цитує те, що різні державні установи говорять на цю тему, а не те, що насправді думає медичний світ. Спостереження за вашим натрієм, ймовірно, також не зашкодить, але охоплює спину кардіологів. (Насправді у мене була цікава дискусія про це зі Скоттом тільки вчора ввечері про лікаря, з яким він обговорював це, який сказав щось дуже схоже на те, чому, незважаючи на те, що він знає, що натрій не буде шкідливим таким чином, він все ще говорить деяким своїм пацієнтам стежити за споживанням натрію.)<br/>Зрештою, як я завжди кажу, "запитати все", але і при питанні, зробити дослідження, щоб знайти відповіді теж, а потім двічі перевірити, що дослідження просто, щоб переконатися. І, можливо, не робити помилку прирівнювання граматики і письмові здібності зі знанням предмета або інтелекту. Я працював з тонною письменників. Я можу сказати, журналісти (і інші такі люди з письмовим досвідом) чудово пишуть ... Майже всі вони жахливі в дослідженнях, що здивувало мене на журналістів, але, можливо, пояснює багато про стан ЗМІ, що висвітлюють наукові дослідження. Смішно, що найкращим комбінатором письменницьких здібностей та досліджень, здається, є юристи. Вони є феноменальними в обох з мого досвіду. Вчені, або люди з науковим досвідом, як правило, погано пишуть, але неймовірні в дослідженнях і критичному мисленні. Звичайно, це стосується лише кількох десятків письменників, з якими я працював, і є один виняток, який я знайшов у цьому, але це тенденція, яку я спостерігав.<br/>Я думаю, що всі повинні бути різними. Для мене сіль підвищує кров'яний тиск багато. Я перевіряю bl pr 4-6x в день. Залишається досить низьким, коли я залишаюся під 300 мг солі. Як тільки я з'їм багато солі, як китайська їжа або навіть м'ясо і сир суб або два шматки піци мій bl pr йде до 170/98. Це займає пару днів, щоб отримати сіль з мого тіла. Потім він буде опускатися до 130/80, а іноді і трохи нижче. Мені 67.<br/>ви щойно запропонували речі, що містять велику кількість простих вуглеводів, також містять пшеницю. Цукор має високу осмолярність, але ігнорується через вагу, що застосовується до солі<br/>Тільки дієтичне видалення пшениці може знизити bp на 20-40 мм рт.ст. Продовження життя компанії говорить, що це також корисно оптимізує ліпідні профілі крові.<br/>Ви бачите, як ви, можливо, базуєте те, що ви бачите, на припущеннях, заснованих на тому, що вам сказали, на основі гіпотези, яка не має доказів.<br/>Серцево-судинні проблеми в обсерваційних дослідженнях тільки виявили кореляцію з людьми, які їдять дуже велику кількість 5 грамів солі в день, ви можете уявити, яку кількість нездорової їжі вони їдять, щоб досягти цієї кількості.<br/>Якщо ваша проблема - сіль, у вас є основна умова, що викликає її, тому що ви не отримуєте високу кількість в будь-якому випадку, але ви також ігноруєте інші причини, які є проблемою, коли особливі речі рекламуються як основний сприяючий фактор, коли немає доказів, що вони є причиною.<br/>Розглянемо ваш клітинний калій, мідь, вплив свинцю, магній, споживання вітаміну Е, рівні coq10, подразники та стрес, які можуть збільшити згортання і звуження судин.<br/>Якщо я можу прокоментувати всю полеміку з орфографії / грамматики ... в моєму досвіді спостереження за людьми, населення (принаймні, розумні, вся моя сім'я має високий IQ, а мій чоловік - геній, буквально, і оскільки у мене немає друзів з нижчим інтелектом для контрольної групи, я можу говорити тільки з моїх спостережень за сім'єю моєї сім'ї та чоловіка) ділиться на два типи: математики і слова. Мій батько був математичною людиною, як і я, коли я був дуже маленьким, однак, я жив з моєю матір'ю, яка, безумовно, є людиною слів, все моє життя, що призвело до того, що я перетворився на людину слів. Мій чоловік може бути найрозумнішою людиною, яку я коли-небудь зустрічав, але з його орфографії, граматики та словникового запасу ви ніколи не дізнаєтеся про це. Він технік з ремонту комп'ютерів, може виправити будь-що, дуже універсальний у своїх робочих здібностях, може вирішити проблеми алгебри, з якими я борюся протягом декількох хвилин за раз, одним поглядом, але не може назвати ім'я нашого сина.<br/>Наскільки я можу судити, вчені, як правило, люди математики більше, ніж слова людей. (Просто для запису, одна з моїх попередніх робіт було дослідження, і я граматика нацист і sesquipedalian.<br/>Мені було цікаво, чи можу я попросити автора цієї статті про невелику послугу.<br/>Спочатку я прочитав це речення щодо споживання солі:<br/>«Але я розкрию теорію про те, чому сіль підвищує кров'яний тиск нижче - просто зрозумійте, що це просто теорія, і вона не підкріплена більшою частиною будь-яких вагомих наукових доказів».<br/>Тут ви використовуєте "Теорія" в його популярній мові. WHich це добре і все. Проблема в тому, що це наукова стаття, пов'язана і коли теорія не підтверджена доказами, ми називаємо це "Гіпотезою".<br/>Ті з нас, хто пише в науковій сфері, повинні докласти зусиль, щоб зробити цю відмінність, в основному тому, що наступного разу, коли я отримаю якийсь молодий креаціоніст Землі, який скаже мені, що еволюція - це "просто теорія", я клянусь, що почну стрибати вгору і вниз, як шимпанзе, і робити зворотне саммеро. Тоді я кидаю в нього фекалії.<br/>Я впевнений, що ви не хочете, щоб така сцена стала реальністю.<br/>Отже, давайте почнемо кампанію, щоб назвати теорію «узгодженою групою перевірених загальних тверджень, які зазвичай вважаються правильними, які можуть бути використані як принципи пояснення та передбачення для класу явищ» і назвати все, що має бути витягнуте з заднього отвору, «Гіпотезою».<br/>BTW: Я знаю, що словник повернути обидва значення. Або заради науки, давайте змінимо значення назад, оскільки у нас вже є хороше робоче слово для "Я щойно витягнув це з дупи".<br/>Марко: Це хороший момент. Я почну працювати над тим, щоб розрізняти майбутні статті.<br/>Жоден законний висновок не може бути зроблений з одного вимірювання артеріального тиску. АД широко варіюється навіть від моменту до моменту. Я багато разів бачив падіння 160 / 100 до 130 / 75 протягом декількох хвилин. Крім того, вимірювальне обладнання BP дуже мінливе і сприйнятливе до широких варіацій від таких речей, як розмір манжети та варіації користувача.<br/>Будь-які висновки, зроблені з декількох вимірювань, є не більше ніж спекуляцією і бажанням.<br/>По-перше, це не рецензована журнальна стаття. Я згоден, правильне використання "теорії" було заплутано розмовною версією "просто припущення". Але, давайте рухаємося далі, добре?<br/>Я не розумію, що стаття в найменшій мірі вводить в оману. Я розумію, що автор робить точку зору, яка, мабуть, втрачена на багатьох - "Як стверджується, в даний час немає твердих доказів того, що сіль буде хронічно підвищувати кров'яний тиск. Так, жодного".<br/>Він також згадує, щоб мислити критично. Отже, якщо ви не вірите йому, а) продовжуйте з вашою вірою, або б) з'ясувати для себе. Робіть роботу. Прочитайте статті. Тепер у вас є відправна точка. Дякую йому за це.<br/>На мою думку, зосереджуючись на випадкових граматичних помилках або дебатах «теорія проти передчуття», непотрібно зменшує намір автора. Мій висновок полягає в тому, що ця стаття допомагає оскаржити мої припущення про те, що я думав, вже науково зроблено. Я чомусь навчився.<br/>Майкл Стеллі Я не впевнений, що ви конкретно посилалися на мій пост щодо використання "теорії", але я запевняю вас, що мій коментар не мав на меті критикувати письменника взагалі. Принаймні не в тих же термінах, як граматичний або правопис "помилка".<br/>Мій коментар не про «помилку», а про те, що ті з нас, хто читає і пише про науку, роблять свій внесок, щоб повернути використання слова «теорія» з мейнстриму або, принаймні, ми намагаємося.<br/>Є ті, які коментують очевидні орфографічні помилки, і я згоден, що вони не важливі в контексті інформації, представленої в статті (хоча я згоден, що вони можуть відволікати, і я говорю від не носія англійської мови), але якщо їх кількість і характер не є такими, що вони роблять розуміння статті складним або навіть неможливим, ви не знайдете, що я публікую про них.<br/>Слово «теорія», з іншого боку, є словом, яке активно використовується певними фракціями дискусії про науку / релігію, щоб знецінити 200 років наукового прогресу, і воно активно використовується, щоб ввести дітей в оману знецінення науки в цілому.<br/>Якщо ви дивилися дебати Nye - Ham, Gawker попросив деяких креаціоністів написати питання прихильникам еволюції на аркуші паперу, і вони опублікували ці питання у вигляді зображень. Незмінно з'явилося питання "це просто теорія".<br/>Саме в цьому дусі я попросив кураторів цього сайту спробувати використати це слово в його науковому значенні. Якщо ми в галузі науки і техніки цього не зробимо, ми не можемо очікувати, що ті, хто хоче спотворити науку для своїх цілей, зроблять це самостійно.<br/>Отже, при всій повазі, я не буду слухатися вашої поради. Я, безумовно, дозволю ковзати дурні орфографічні помилки, але це важливо для мене, і це повинно бути важливо для всіх нас, хто любить науку.<br/>Ніхто не спотворює науку більше, ніж еволюціоністи, висновки і спекуляції, засновані на припущенні фактів, не є доказами. Жодна область не має стільки обманів і припущень, як еволюція.<br/>Продовжуючи використовувати хибний контрастуючий аргумент і припущення, що, оскільки створення повинно бути неправильним, еволюція повинна бути істинною, не є наукою, докази не показують, що макроеволюція можлива на даний момент за будь-якою з багатьох сучасних конкуруючих теорій, заснованих виключно на мутації та природному відборі. Я пропоную знайти інший механізм.<br/>Оскільки це суперечливі докази повністю ігнорується або навіть стверджується як доказ більш складного процесу, але все ж доказ еволюції, коли це не так у всіх випадках.<br/>В даний час у нас є докази абиогенезу, що це абсолютний факт, як і мікроеволюція абсолютно правильна, однак, з точки зору макроеволюції я б запропонував, щоб наука повернулася до того, щоб базуватися на доказах, а не на припущенні факту і перекошенні даних, щоб спонукати її занадто відповідати теорії.<br/>Оскільки еволюція не є наукою, це віра, дуже схожа на теорію Великого вибуху, яка має величезні суперечливі докази того, що в минулому, коли люди використовували докази для підтвердження або спростування теорій, ця теорія була б відкладена, поєднання обох цих теорій схоже на релігію, релігію світських гуманістів. Це так само політично, як вони приходять громади, які підтримують ці вірування чорна куля і ad hominem вони не можуть стояти на докази, але на залякування. Дослідження показують, що ad hominem настільки ж корисний, як аргументований аргумент, це використовується наукою illigitamate, такою як кліматичний алармізм і макроеволюція, які в даний час не мають доказів на свою користь, але використовують ті ж самі типи пропаганди та нападів, що припускають, що будь-хто проти них є антинаукою або придурком.<br/>Я пропоную читати http://www.scienceantevolution.org<br/>Люди, які не згодні з еволюцією, автоматично не вірять у творіння, еволюціоністи завжди нападають і відволікаються від своїх власних слабких аргументів, створюючи свій власний солом’яник того, що інші вірять і припускають, грунтуючись на своїх власних, часто придуркованих припущеннях, що вони підкріплені доказами, коли вони ними не є.<br/>Один факт я хотів би додати:<br/>Тіазид і тіазид-подібні сечогінні засоби є ще одним доказом в цій суперечці. Цікаво, що тіазиди називаються сечогінними засобами, але при щоденному прийомі цей сечогінний ефект стає майже нульовим. Після періоду хронічної терапії тіазидом основною перевагою цих препаратів є те, що вони збільшують виведення іонів натрію та хлориду з крові за допомогою симпортера Na / Cl в дистальних звивистих канальцях (поряд з іншими ефектами, такими як утримання кальцію). Незважаючи на втрату сечогінного ефекту, тіазиди зберігають свої ефекти зниження артеріального тиску в довгостроковій перспективі і є одним з препаратів, що використовуються для зниження артеріального тиску. Цей знижуючий ефект, як правило, пов'язаний з видаленням натрію і, здається, відповідає ідеї, що високий рівень натрію підвищує кров'яний тиск.<br/>Вірте чи ні. Сіль, здається, знижує мій АД. Якщо я з'їдаю занадто багато чіпсів, у мене насправді виникає запаморочення від низького АД. Не можу сказати, що я це отримую.<br/>Ця "теорія" просто дурна. Сіль Збільшує артеріальний тиск багато разів! Це факт, спостерігається, контролюється. Випадково з'їсти деякі досить солоний матеріал один день, ніж потрібно тиждень сечогінних засобів, щоб позбутися від усього, що сіль з організму і привести кров'яний тиск від 190-200 (! так, що високий він отримав !!!) повернутися до норми (120-130). Не розповідайте історії, які не є правдою.<br/>Не всі люди однаково реагують на дієтичну сіль. Моя пропозиція для нас - взяти до уваги рівень натрію в наших нормальних лабораторних результатах в мінімальних річних фізичних показниках.<br/>З дитинства я звик приймати більше солі під час їжі, але ніколи не стикався з проблемою високого АД, замість цього іноді вона опускається нижче норми. Я Googled цю проблему & прийшов до висновку, що моєму організму потрібна сіль більше, ніж зазвичай, щоб компенсувати генетично передану проблему «Ніжного АД». Отже? Ваш мозок є інструктором для вашого здоров'я. Ви повинні виконувати його накази, щоб залишатися дійсно здоровим!<br/>Ну, я просто дієтолог (наприклад, майор університету харчування, який буде випускатися в травні) і, можливо, те, що я дізнався бик, але після того, як подумав про патофізіологію того, як натрій може вплинути на кров'яний тиск, я вважаю, що рекомендація має сенс, але вам потрібно буде зробити більше, ніж просто скоротити натрій. Важливим є натрій: співвідношення калію (тобто ви їсте купу продуктів з високим вмістом переробленого натрію в порівнянні зі свіжими або замороженими фруктами та овочами). Я визнаю, що не всі чутливі до солі і що ми свідомо вирішили, в галузі охорони здоров'я, припустити, що всі, тому що тестування на чутливість до солі (якщо це слово!) є дорогим, довгим і непрактичним. Але ідея про те, що немає хороших правдоподібних доказів, що пов'язують сіль і гіпертонію, є помилковою. Ось лише 6 статей. Це не ті, які були дані нашими професорами для читання (хоча якщо ви хочете, щоб я знайшов їх для вас, я впевнений, що я можу), але вони хороші, тим не менш, і вам не потрібен спеціальний код університету або членство для доступу до них. У будь-якому випадку, ось ви йдете, якщо ви хочете, щоб прочитати більше:<br/>Чи є якісь з них показують, що існує кореляція без інших факторів? Ви кажете, що "вам потрібно було б зробити більше, ніж просто скоротити натрій"... Чи є докази того, що виконання цих інших дій без скорочення натрію не працює так само, як і скорочення натрію?<br/>Ви не читали? Кокрейн використовував 150 випробувань і 13 досліджень, так що у вас є 6, це ваша "освіта" на роботі. Промивання мізків, а потім підтвердження упередженого пошуку підтримки помилкової гіпотези, яка, як було встановлено, вже не високої якості.<br/>Якщо Кокрейн не використовував його, це не високоякісна стаття, якщо він це зробив, то підтримка не була значною в статті. Механізм осмолярності застосовується до дієт з високим вмістом цукру, але все це про сіль<br/>Проблема тут полягає в низькій якості дослідження публікуються постійно, що люди висувають причинно-наслідковий зв'язок, звідки вони не можуть зробити це, оскільки вони не контролювали всі змінні.<br/>Те ж саме робиться для гіпотези ліпідів і гіпотези холестерину.<br/>Це теж міфи, холестерин з усіх даних зворотно пов'язаний з серцевими захворюваннями.<br/>Зниження абсолютного ризику статинів для серцевих захворювань становить 1,4%, що навряд чи є значним, ефект статинів для зменшення серцевих проблем у тих, хто вже має серцевий напад, може бути пов'язаний виключно з їх ефектом як антикоагулянта. Знову патологічна сміттєва наука використовується для підштовхування лікування без розпізнавання механізмів і змінних. Більшість людей постраждає від інгібування синтезу вітаміну k coq10 і холестерину за допомогою статинів, але лікарі, підкріплені фармацевтичною жадібністю, сприяють їх кожному.<br/>Насичений жир не має механізму, за допомогою якого він може підвищити рівень холестерину, ніяке дослідження заміщення масла чисто заміненим жиром для масла в подвійних жалюзі контролює всі змінні, і чим ближче вони підходять до цього, тим гірше результати втручання ПНЖК стає збільшення всіх причин смерті.<br/>Як кажуть, випробування низької якості, немає великої волі, щоб скасувати гіпотезу, що регулюючі органи та лікарі мають релігійну віру, яка не підкріплена доказами. Ця дезінформація призводить до поганого здоров'я та фармацевтичного прибутку.<br/>Я порвався між тим, щоб з'їсти більше солі чи ні, тому що їжа більше солі зменшує частоту серцевих скорочень і АД і змушує мене спати краще; мої руки і ноги відчувають себе повними і теплими. Мій обсяг поту збільшується, коли я їзджу на велосипеді або ходжу. Але потім після прийому його протягом тижня або 2 потім я помічаю, що АД стає постійно високим; що змушує мене відчувати, що я зробив не так, їжте. Те, що ця стаття згадує, є збільшення обсягу рідини, що цікаво. Перед збільшенням споживання солі мої пальці відчувають себе тонкими. Можливо, після рівня рідини відчувати себе нормально скоротити на сіль до нормального рівня. Тому я просто припускаю, що люди, які мають чутливі до солі, мають хороший об'єм рідини і повинні спостерігати за споживанням солі, інші можуть приймати сіль, але зупинятися, коли вона відчуває себе повною. В основному використовувати сіль підтримувати об'єм рідини.<br/>На основі самоекспериментів, я думаю, що підтримання об'єму рідини дуже важливо. Іноді я відчуваю спрагу і п'ю воду, і вона продовжує виходити; це вимагає деякого споживання солі. В основному, я не їм консерви або багато фаст-фуду, моє споживання солі - це те, що навмисно додається в кулінарії. Після вправи (їжа за книгою і тренування і т.д. викликають проблеми теж) я помічаю, що коли я встаю з положення сидячи, я відчуваю запаморочення, але не нормально. Я думаю, що я можу потіти сіль і, звичайно, я п'ю багато води під час вправи. Я не пропоную їсти більше солі. Те, що я заявляю, це те, як тіло говорить вам, що ваша сіль виснажена, коли ви не відчуваєте себе ситими в ногах і руках. Я думаю, що це до певної міри правильно, оскільки тіло працює більше на концентрації речей, ніж на абсолютних кількостях. Це не є всеосяжною теорією, оскільки є інші речі, які можуть збільшити об’єм крові, у вас вже може бути занадто багато солі в крові і т.д. Для запису, мій натрій в крові завжди знаходиться поблизу нижнього кінця діапазону, тому моя помилка не виштовхне мене за межі діапазону.<br/>Гаразд, який висновок? Я використовую соляний шейкер зараз чи ні? Я тримав занадто довго.<br/>Я думаю, що ця стаття є безвідповідальною в тому, що сіль абсолютно підвищує BP у тих, хто має чутливість до солі. Якщо я з'їм щось дуже солоне, я буквально можу перейти в гіпертонічну кризу протягом години.<br/>Цей тип чутливості є поширеним і не згадувати про нього (тому що він не відповідає теорії авторів?) небезпечно.<br/>Джим Портер: "Тому що це не вписується в теорію авторів?" "Теорії автора" не існує. Це дійсно не те, що ми тут робимо. Це стаття, яка просто пише про наукові дослідження на цю тему і говорить те, що вони говорять, тому вам не потрібно просіювати їх і весь медичний жаргон; ми робимо це для вас - по суті, те, про що ми пишемо, відображає поточний стан людських знань на цю тему. Якщо в якийсь момент щось змінюється, ми оновлюємо статтю. У цьому випадку, однак, особливо два Кокрейнівських огляди досить переконливі: «Після більш ніж 150 випадкових клінічних випробувань і 13 популяційних досліджень без очевидного сигналу на користь зменшення натрію, інша позиція може полягати в тому, щоб прийняти, що такий сигнал може не існувати». Є винятки з кожного правила, і, здавалося б, ви є одним з них, і це дуже цікаво, якщо так, і було б цікаво дізнатися причину. Але, знову ж таки, ми дивимося на те, що говорять наукові дослідження, і намагаємося відобразити це в тому, що ми пишемо. По суті, ми пишемо форму «легкого читання» стиль розважальних оглядових робіт на теми, а не писати науково-дослідні роботи.<br/>Підкреслюючи про сіль, швидше за все, вб'є вас задовго до самої солі. Робіть те, що робить вас щасливим, і ви, ймовірно, житимете довше, ніж в іншому випадку; і навіть якщо ви цього не зробите, принаймні ви будете насолоджуватися часом, який у вас є.<br/>Я вважаю, що проблема полягає в тому, коли сіль змішується з жиром, і це викликає високий кров'яний тиск. Наприклад, хтось говорив про їх зростання під час їжі чипсів / чипсів - це тому, що чіпси містять жир. Те ж саме стосується картоплі фрі або інших жирних страв. Однак, якщо ви будете посипати сіль на щось на зразок фруктів, це не матиме такого ж ефекту і не підвищить кров'яний тиск.<br/>Я думаю, що натрій отримує поганий реп, і деякі люди насправді споживають занадто мало. Я думаю, що сіль з фруктами або салатами - це добре, але проблема полягає в комбінації солі / жиру, і якщо ви думаєте про це, саме там люди зазвичай отримують свої картопляні чіпси, картопля фрі, сильно приправлене м'ясо, в кремових стравах тощо.<br/>Людина, яка написала цю статтю, не додає нічого цінного до дискусії про високий кров’яний тиск, крім заохочення людей засунути голову в пісок.<br/>Я борюся з високим кров’яним тиском близько 12 років, оскільки серйозний нещасний випадок змусив мене бути фізично неактивним протягом року після аварії.<br/>Високий кров'яний тиск можна контролювати за допомогою ліків і без них, і люди по-різному реагують на різні методи лікування, і є природні ліки від цього захворювання.<br/>Високий кров'яний тиск може викликати інсульти, крововиливи в мозок і сприяти діабету і хворобам нирок.<br/>Баланс між калієм і натрієм в нашій крові дуже важливий, і, на жаль, більшість лікарів не мають жодного уявлення про те, як харчування і правильна гідратація впливають на цей стан.<br/>Більшість лікарів я був просто дати рецепти, які можуть або не можуть працювати.<br/>Існують природні речовини, які дозволили мені знизити кров'яний тиск протягом декількох днів від надзвичайно високого до майже нормального, в той час як лікарі та фармацевти скажуть, що ліки (наприклад, Cozaar і Norvasc) може зайняти до місяця, щоб працювати.<br/>Я виявив, що сік одного лимона з цедрою або ефірною олією, доданої до 16 унцій мінеральної води, мав значні ефекти.<br/>Вживання цього один або два рази на день мало дуже значний ефект у моєму випадку; мій кров'яний тиск зріс з 220/95 до 130/90 протягом 3 днів.<br/>Часник (дезодорований) також допомагає, і фруктові або овочеві соки з пониженим вмістом солі і високим вмістом калію також допомагають. (V-8 з низьким вмістом солі або V-8 зелений).<br/>Це не бажане рішення; це пов'язано з хімією; це не означає, що всі будуть однаково реагувати на ці методи лікування, але я не згоден дуже сильно, коли хтось говорить, що сіль не впливає на кров'яний тиск.<br/>Це здається мені безвідповідальним і безвідповідальним, якщо, звичайно, ви не працюєте на одного з виробників солі.<br/>Сіль необхідна, і більшість столових солей містять йод, який є необхідною поживною речовиною для людини.<br/>Пити достатню кількість чистої води також дуже важливо; те, що мої лікарі ніколи не заважали згадати.<br/>Це дозволяє організму позбутися від зайвої солі і допомагає організму очиститися.<br/>Є багато натуральних речовин і деякі продукти (наприклад, песто), які можуть допомогти знизити кров'яний тиск, і ви можете знайти багато повідомлень в Інтернеті про них.<br/>Web Md і клініка Майо обидва мають повідомлення на цю тему, і я довіряю їм багато більше, ніж автор цього повідомлення.<br/>Мені здається, що це вправа на захист невиправданих.<br/>З якою метою?<br/>Хто такий Гіппократ і що він, чорт візьми, знав?<br/>У мене дуже низький кров'яний тиск. Якщо я встану занадто швидко, я буду слабким на обличчі. Мій лікар сказав мені їсти стільки солі, скільки я хочу, не хвилюйтеся.<br/>У будь-якому випадку, я прийму всі ці поради з щіпкою ... ви знаєте, що. ;-D<br/>Я їм багато солі (і я маю на увазі * LOT *). Кілька років тому після того, як мені набридло постійно говорити, наскільки це погано, я вирішив перевірити це. Як Ph.D. Я знаю, як науково планувати тест, і протягом декількох місяців мінімізувати якомога більше змінних, я перевірив свій кров'яний тиск під час мого регулярного споживання солі проти низького споживання солі. Результати були в значній мірі, як і очікувалося, хоча деякі люди /можуть / бути трохи нетерпимими до відносно високих рівнів споживання солі, для мене не було ніякої різниці взагалі. Я повернувся до їжі, як мені подобається (солоний), і сказати всім, хто радить проти цього, вони просто не знають, що вони говорять про LOL<br/>Я 27 жінка. Я почала мати високий кров'яний тиск, коли я приймала Accutane півтора року тому (Accutane збільшує накопичення холестерину). Те, що я відчував, було інтенсивним, мій пульс був на 120bpm, я запаморочився, мої руки затиснуті в незвичайну форму кігтя, і вони поколювались, поки вони не втратили почуття. Я думав, що я насправді вмираю. Мені сказали, що це просто панічна атака, але у мене ніколи не було ніяких справжніх проблем з тривогою. Мені давали кисень протягом цілої години, коли я раптом почав тягнути сіль. Я попросив свого друга побігти до Макдональдса і отримати мені додаткову солону картоплю. Через кілька хвилин після того, як я з'їла всю цю сіль, мій кров'яний тиск повернувся до норми, мої руки повернулися, і я знову могла нормально ходити і дихати.<br/>Я вважаю, що речі, які викликають його найбільше для мене є недолік сну, не їдять нічого цілий день, кукурудза, пшениця, і хімічні солі, такі як MSG. Але морська сіль і нормальна столова сіль не роблять його гірше, вони роблять його краще! З тим, що сказав, у мене завжди були результати аналізу крові, що показують високий рівень калію. Чи може це якось бути залучено? Мій доктор просто пожимає плечами, як викликано моєю любов'ю до картоплі та цитрусових фруктів лол<br/>Вам може знадобитися новий лікар з високим вмістом калію або гіперкаліємія може викликати епізоди, які ви описуєте, і Accutane може викликати гіперкаліємію.<br/>Калій і натрій, очевидно, пов'язані, оскільки ваші клітини постійно обмінюються ними в клітини і з них для підтримки більш високих внутрішньоклітинних концентрацій калію.<br/>Кортизол, який піднімається з недосипанням, не їжею та іншими стресами, змінює цей процес концентрації калію в клітині, але призначений для збільшення екскреції калію, клітинного поглинання абсорбції натрію та затримки натрію в нирках, може бути щось не так з цим процесом, коли калій не виділяється. Нормальною причиною є гальмування ренін-ангіотензинової системи, яка регулює артеріальний тиск.<br/>Сіль живить наднирники, але ви можете отримати більше вітаміну С, який концентрується там, а також в гіпофізі, оскільки вони регулюють ваш кортизол і знижують кортизол і стрес, ймовірно, зменшуючи тяжкість епізодів.<br/>Речі, щоб подивитися, магній, вітамін e, надниркових залоз, мідь / цинк, нирки і наднирників функції.<br/>Фармацевт тут. Дякую за всі корисні коментарі на цьому сайті. Можна побачити всі розумно написані повідомлення від людей, які знизили свій високий кров'яний тиск, обмеживши сіль. Я один з цих людей. Мій артеріальний тиск рік тому був в середньому 180/120, коли не лікували, і коли на 3 різних препаратів, в середньому 140/90. Відчувши себе жахливо, або від побічних ефектів від ліків або від головного болю від високого кров'яного тиску, я вирішив змінити свою дієту. Результати, яких я досяг, були приголомшливими. Кров'яний тиск абсолютно нормальний, 120 / 80. Ніяких головних болів, або відчуття, що моє горло набрякло, або відчуття, що моя голова була занадто гарячою ... Я міг продовжувати і продовжувати. Я робив це без дорогих продуктів. Я просто, як це можливо в даний час в США, їв необроблені продукти і уникав всієї доданої солі. Зверніть увагу, вся «додана» сіль. Як багато хто правильно вказав, сіль необхідна для життя людини. І багато продуктів природно містять всю необхідну нам сіль, тому додавати її не потрібно. Слухаючи цих передбачуваних експертів, мені цікаво, як будь-які люди коли-небудь виживали 10 000 років тому, якщо їм не пощастило знайти соляний блок, щоб лизати кожен день! Я прочитав один коментар про когось, хто мав хороші результати від "сок одного лимона з цедрою або ефірним маслом, доданим до 16 унцій мінеральної води". Я б кинув виклик йому та іншим, щоб просто спробувати лимонний сік з водою. Я вважаю, що якщо я прибираю себе тільки один стакан лимонної води раз на тиждень, це чудово вплинуло на моє здоров'я. Інші інгредієнти можуть допомогти, але це був би цікавий експеримент для вас. Тому я, як і багато інших, чутливий до солі. Можливо, деякі люди можуть їсти величезну кількість солі на регулярній основі без будь-яких негативних наслідків для здоров'я. Це не так для багатьох з нас, і це образливо, коли так звані "професіонали" або "вчені" сперечаються про це. Одне я завжди кажу своїм пацієнтам: "Коли справа доходить до вашого здоров'я, довіряйте собі понад усіх інших". Якщо ви переконані, що конкретний препарат змушує вас почувати себе хворим, і ваш лікар або фармацевт мають на увазі, що все це у вашій голові, довіряйте собі, а не їм. Якщо ви, як і я, відчуваєте себе в тисячу разів краще, коли ви обмежуєте споживання солі або оброблених харчових продуктів, то, будь ласка, продовжуйте робити те, що ви робите, і не слухайте тих, хто пропонує інакше! Ви будете здоровішими і щасливішими. Дякую за увагу, друзі здалеку.<br/>Хоча це, безумовно, можливо, що ви чутливі до солі, коли ви вирішили змінити свою дієту, ви змінили багато інших речей на додаток до того, скільки солі ви з'їли. Два найпростіші способи знизити кров'яний тиск без зміни солі 1. схуднути. 2. їжте більше овочів і фруктів (так звані продукти, багаті калієм). Численні клінічні та обсерваційні дослідження показали, що співвідношення натрію і калію, ймовірно, важливіше, ніж скільки натрію ви їсте. [Зверніть увагу, що це стосується тільки 99,999999% людства, яке їсть між 3k і 6k мг натрію в день. Сіль, ймовірно, є проблемою, якщо ви їсте поза нормального діапазону, як 12,000mg + натрію в день.]<br/>Я збирався в основному сказати те ж саме. У мене був високий кров'яний тиск ... Я зробив 30 день Paleo Challenge ... Всі чисті від землі продукти. Я фактично збільшив споживання солі, вводячи багато солоної яловичини в'ялену і мариновану їжу в свій раціон для перекусів. Мало того, що мій кров'яний тиск в кінцевому підсумку майже ідеально ... я також втратив 16 фунтів. Я навіть не був тим, кого ви дійсно вважаєте за вагу, щоб почати з ... 178 фунтів до 162 фунтів за 30 днів. Мої дивні головні болі зникли ... всі дев'ять ярдів, які приходять з високим кров'яним тиском. Я переконаний, що сіль і кров'яний тиск не пов'язані ... і я думаю, що це коп для людей, які дійсно повинні сісти на фактичну здорову дієту.<br/>Ця стаття небезпечна і може переконати когось використовувати всю сіль, яку вони хочуть. Але все, що мені потрібно зробити, це з'їсти пару великих мішків картопляних чіпсів, і я отримую 180/90 протягом декількох днів, не вживайте сіль, а потім протягом 3-4 днів і добре зволожуйте, повертаючись до 130/70. Тепер "може бути" я гіперчутливий, але так як це повторилося півдюжини разів, я уникаю солі. Існує багато в нормальних продуктах харчування /<br/>Схоже, ви не знаєте, про що ви говорите ... прочитайте Curt Nicol DD PhD запис нижче. і прочитайте ще раз цю статтю ... ви були упереджені впливом лікарів, які отримали упередження роками і роками всіх yada.yada.yada... прочитайте статтю ще раз. Звичайно, ви не збираєтеся починати їсти сіль за фунтом ... все було б жахливо в будь-якому випадку.<br/>Що небезпечно, так це поради та методи лікування без наукової основи, засновані тільки на гіпотезі, побічний ефект скорочення регулярного споживання солі для більшості людей полягає в тому, що вони вживають менше обробленої їжі, що містить величезну кількість рафінованих або простих вуглеводів, високо схильних до окислення олій, денатурованих речовин, забруднюючих речовин та добавок.<br/>Зниження цих показників призведе до поліпшення загального харчування.<br/>Обмеження солі само по собі без будь-яких інших змінних не покажуть практично ніякого ефекту у більшості людей і може бути шкідливим для інших.<br/>Я щоб. Я ввів детальний коментар зупинити і почати тести, які 100% підтвердили мою гіпотезу, що Na був одним з великих учасників артеріального тиску. Потрібні зусилля, щоб документувати і записувати методи і результат. Моя була така висока, як 205 / 115. Я отримав його до послідовного 100/65 протягом двох років. Моя робота документується в цьому розділі коментарів, але ще не з'явився.<br/>Багато людей тут говорять, що їдять мішок чіпсів збільшує їх кров'яний тиск. Чи вони не розуміють, що це не здорова їжа? Чи вони думають, що це, можливо, не містить всі неправильні речі?<br/>Повинна бути якась інша їжа з високим вмістом натрію, яку вони можуть використовувати, щоб показати, як сіль впливає на їх кров'яний тиск.<br/>Правильно... що погано це масло і жир, який йде труби і обмежує їх... плюс картопляні чіпси, це все крохмаль, який перетворюється на цукор, потім жир ...<br/>Я не був би достатньо довірливим, щоб думати ні на хвилину, що сіль не пов'язана з високим кров'яним тиском і підвищеною температурою тіла, тому що це, безумовно, так. Я зменшив свій 160 над 80 кров'яний тиск до 119 над 81 протягом декількох тижнів, різко скоротивши споживання солі. Чому це кожен раз, коли я їм кілька порцій картопляних чіпсів, або з'їсти картопля фрі Макдональда, я отримую негайно обличчя роздуте і гарячкове? Я навіть відчував і чув, так, звужені вени в моїй власній голові, після того, як високий кров'яний тиск, розширити, розширити, і розірвати знову, після випиваючи чашки, і чашки води, з зникненням лихоманки, зникнення дискомфорту або перевантаженого відчуття голови, і зниження кров'яного тиску.<br/>Це дійсно турбує мене, і я не зізнаюся, що зараз трохи збентежений. Я люблю сіль і можу споживати більше за один прийом їжі, ніж ви повинні споживати за день. Це ніколи не вплинуло на мій b.p.<br/>Потім, коли мій B.P. почав збільшуватися, як я став старше, мій лікар сказав, щоб вирізати сіль. Так що я зробив ... без реального ефекту. Я був доставлений в лікарню з серйозною інфекцією, тільки щоб виявити, що, коли мене виписали, мене тримали на дієті з низьким вмістом натрію, хоча при прийомі, мій рівень натрію був небезпечно низьким.<br/>Все це змусило мене повірити, що небезпеки натрію були лише міфом, принаймні для мене. Але потім моя дружина захворіла. Вони використовували для ін'єкцій її з "натрію" (солоної води я вважаю), і її кров'яний тиск підійде майже відразу. Це було внутрішньовенно, однак.<br/>Так це те, що я не чутливий до солі, або це щось про шлунок, який діє як бар'єр (так що проковтнута сіль не впливає на вас), в той час як IV сіль буде?<br/>Для чогось, що є настільки фундаментальним у медичній консультації, це настільки розчаровує, що, здається, так мало досліджень, принаймні якісних досліджень, проведених на ньому.<br/>І навпаки, під час пізнішого госпіталізації вони знову дали мені низький натрій (як тільки ідіот помістить його на ваші медичні записи, здається, неможливо його зняти ...) і дали мені ліки для зниження артеріального тиску. Мій б. п. впав через підлогу і турбував їх на одному етапі.<br/>Ліки АД не показані, щоб поліпшити результати або бути безпечним в більшості ситуацій. Сучасна медицина досить небезпечна, вони вбивають людей постійно тим, що вони призначають.<br/>Ваша дружина може мати проблеми з нирками і наднирниками, в той час як у вас, швидше за все, є судинні проблеми. Розглянемо можливі екологічні причини, ви п'єте воду з фторидом, який збільшує всмоктування свинцю, відсутність антиоксидантів, таких як ala, vit a / e / c / d / k2 може призвести до збільшення окислювального стресу артеріального склерозу і кальцифікації артерій, що обмежує здатність весалів до діалату, підвищений вплив подразників підвищує судини і коагулювання за рахунок збільшення випуску сератонінінів і зниження рівня оксиду.<br/>Ці речі можуть викликати проблеми в будь-якому місці.<br/>Я щойно витратив годину на написання коментаря. Мій лікар хоче його побачити. Я не з'являюся. Що відбувається? Чи я витратив свій час? Будь ласка, відповідайте.<br/>Відмінна стаття. Статті такого типу виводять здоров'я психів і всезнайки ....просто подивіться на коментарі. Це також нагадує мені про "глобальне потепління"... зміна клімату (або як вони називають це на цьому тижні) "експерти", які проповідують це, як це було Євангеліє, коли у них теж немає остаточних доказів. |
| Nomadic Kirghiz. Golodnaia Steppe.<br/>This remarkable photograph shows a nomadic Kyrgyz family resting in the steppe grasslands. The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group widely spread over the area of eastern Turkestan. The man, with weathered face, is dressed in a skullcap and a frayed traditional striped coat. He is burdened with padded blankets and probably a small tent. The woman, with brilliant white turban, wears a tattered cloak and carries smaller bundles of blankets and clothes. Their small boy wears a colorful skullcap and a sparkling green silk jacket in the Chinese style. To the left is a desert thorn bush. The image is by Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863–1944), who used a special color photography process to create a visual record of the Russian Empire in the early 20th century. Some of Prokudin-Gorskii’s photographs date from about 1905, but the bulk of his work is from between 1909 and 1915, when, with the support of Tsar Nicholas II and the Ministry of Transportation, he undertook extended trips through many different parts of the empire. In 1911 he made two trips to an area of Central Asia then known as Turkestan (present-day Uzbekistan and neighboring states), where he photographed Islamic architectural monuments as well as Russian development projects, such as an irrigation scheme to make Golodnaia Steppe (“Hungry Steppe”) a productive area for raising cotton and wheat.<br/>Photo: Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.<br/>- acku Afghanistan<br/>- Image Size<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>- Contained in galleries | Кочові киргизи.

У 1911 році він здійснив дві поїздки в район Центральної Азії, відомий як Туркестан (сучасний Узбекистан і сусідні держави), де він сфотографував ісламські архітектурні пам'ятки, а також російські проекти розвитку, такі як іригаційна схема, щоб зробити Голодний степ продуктивним районом для вирощування бавовни і пшениці.<br/>Фото: Сергій Михайлович Прокудін-Горський.<br/>- ACKU Афганістан<br/>- Розмір зображення<br/>- 1800кс1667 / 693.3КБ<br/>- Зберігається в галереях |
| Prescribed burning is a tool used in native landscapes and commercial timberlands across the world. There are many reasons why a land manager might use prescribed burning to enhance or manage the land.<br/>One of the most beneficial results of prescribed burning, regardless of the intended end goal, is the reduction of fuel loads in the case a wildfire breaks out. Wildfires can be devastating for urban and rural communities across the country. In 2020, one of the worst most recent wildfire seasons in the United States, nearly 18,000 structures were lost to out-of-control fires, over half of those being homes. In the last decade, it has cost between $1.5 billion and $3 billion dollars each year for federal wildfire suppression tactics, including equipment and personnel.<br/>The top 10 most destructive fires by financial losses have occurred in California, with the largest being the 2018 Camp Fire, which incurred over $10.4 billion in expenses for those affected. Wildfires aren’t just financially impactful, they can cause major environmental damage and be a nuisance to general human activities.<br/>Of course, raging fires burning in the area means that road closures are likely, which impacts travel. In addition, smoke generated by wildfires can have strong effects on communities even hundreds of miles away as it is carried in the atmosphere. This can drop ash and particulate matter and impacts air quality, making it difficult for many to be outside. Communication can be impacted if fires approach telephone lines, cellphone towers, or even energy distribution centers.<br/>You can see why minimizing wildfires would result in a reduction to impacts to human activity.<br/>Environmental damage can be significant since wildfires often burn large swaths of lands, are high intensity, and have severe impacts. In 2020, nearly 60,000 fires in the United States, impacting over 10 million acres on the east and west coast. Typically more fires in the eastern states, but these fires are smaller in size and generally are less severe. Western states see marginally fewer fires than the East, but the western fires can be more intense and consume more acreage at once. This regional difference is generally seen because of the landscapes, the types of plants and fuel available to burn, as well as weather differences, particularly drought conditions. Wildfires impact plant communities and wildlife in the area, and overall have a negative influence on the environment.<br/>It may seem weird to fight fire with fire, but there are “good fires” and “bad fires.” Prescribed burning are like a prescription written by a doctor — the “doctor” in this case being the land manager. The prescription details what the goals of the burn are, the weather conditions when the burn should be conducted for the best results and least human impact, and the intensity of the fire to achieve the results.<br/>This prescription means that the fire will occur in a safe, controlled way with little impact on the environment or humans.<br/>Prescribed fire does more than just prevent raging wildfires, it can also benefit native landscapes, improve food sources and habitat for wildlife, or control underbrush in timber stands. Many native plants across the world are designed for fire to occur, since fires would naturally occur long before human intervention. Some plants need fire for their seed pods to open, some need other plants to be cleared out by fire so their seeds can germinate and succeed, while others are designed to withstand fire with thick, insulating bark or waxy foliage.<br/>Prescribed burners can tell you many stories of deer, turkey, quail, and other wildlife coming in immediately after a fire to consume plants and insects.

Є багато причин, чому менеджер землі може використовувати приписане спалювання для поліпшення або управління землею.<br/>Одним з найбільш корисних результатів призначеного спалювання, незалежно від передбачуваної кінцевої мети, є зниження паливного навантаження у разі виникнення лісової пожежі. Лісові пожежі можуть бути руйнівними для міських та сільських громад по всій країні. У 2020 році, один з найгірших останніх сезонів лісових пожеж у Сполучених Штатах, майже 18 000 конструкцій були втрачені через неконтрольовані пожежі, більше половини з них - будинки. За останнє десятиліття щорічно витрачалося від 1,5 до 3 мільярдів доларів на федеральну тактику придушення лісових пожеж, включаючи обладнання та персонал.<br/>Топ-10 найбільш руйнівних пожеж за фінансовими втратами відбулися в Каліфорнії, причому найбільшим є пожежа в таборі 2018 року, яка понесла понад 10,4 мільярда доларів витрат для постраждалих. Лісові пожежі не тільки фінансово впливають, вони можуть завдати великої шкоди навколишньому середовищу і бути неприємністю для загальної людської діяльності.<br/>Звичайно, пожежі, що горять в цьому районі, означають, що закриття доріг є ймовірним, що впливає на подорожі. Крім того, дим, генерований лісовими пожежами, може мати сильний вплив на громади навіть за сотні кілометрів, оскільки він переноситься в атмосферу. Це може скинути попіл і тверді частинки і впливає на якість повітря, що робить його важко для багатьох, щоб бути зовні. Зв'язок може бути порушений, якщо пожежі наближаються телефонні лінії, вежі мобільного зв'язку, або навіть розподілу енергії центрів.<br/>Ви можете зрозуміти, чому мінімізація лісових пожеж призведе до зменшення впливу на людську діяльність.<br/>Екологічна шкода може бути значною, оскільки лісові пожежі часто спалюють великі ділянки земель, мають високу інтенсивність та мають серйозні наслідки. У 2020 році майже 60 000 пожеж у Сполучених Штатах, що зачіпають понад 10 мільйонів акрів на східному та західному узбережжі. Як правило, більше пожеж у східних штатах, але ці пожежі менші за розміром і, як правило, менш серйозні. Західні штати бачать трохи менше пожеж, ніж на Сході, але західні пожежі можуть бути більш інтенсивними і споживати більше площі відразу. Ця регіональна різниця, як правило, спостерігається через ландшафти, типи рослин і палива, доступних для спалювання, а також погодні відмінності, особливо посухові умови. Лісові пожежі впливають на рослинні спільноти та дику природу в цьому районі, і в цілому негативно впливають на навколишнє середовище.<br/>Це може здатися дивним, щоб боротися з вогнем з вогнем, але є "добрі вогні" і "погані пожежі". Призначене спалювання схоже на рецепт, написаний лікарем - "лікар" в цьому випадку є землевпорядником. У рецепті детально описуються цілі опіку, погодні умови, коли опік повинен бути проведений для досягнення найкращих результатів і найменшого впливу на людину, а також інтенсивність вогню для досягнення результатів.<br/>Цей рецепт означає, що пожежа буде відбуватися безпечним, контрольованим способом з невеликим впливом на навколишнє середовище або людей.<br/>Призначений вогонь робить більше, ніж просто запобігає бушуючим лісовим пожежам, він також може принести користь місцевим ландшафтам, поліпшити джерела їжі та середовище проживання для дикої природи або контролювати підлісок у лісових насадженнях. Багато місцевих рослин по всьому світу призначені для пожежі, оскільки пожежі, природно, відбуваються задовго до втручання людини. Деякі рослини потребують вогню, щоб їх насіннєві стручки відкрилися, деякі потребують, щоб інші рослини були очищені вогнем, щоб їх насіння могли проростати і досягати успіху, в той час як інші розроблені, щоб витримати вогонь з товстою, ізоляційною корою або восковим листям.<br/>Призначені пальники можуть розповісти вам багато історій про оленів, індичок, перепелів та інших диких тварин, які приходять відразу після пожежі, щоб споживати рослини та комах. Дика природа також виграє від поліпшення харчування рослин і кращих місць проживання в районах, що відновлюються після пожежі.<br/>Призначений вогонь може бути корисним інструментом для вашої землі теж. Зверніться до місцевої лісової служби або призначеного спалювання асоціації, щоб побачити, як приписане спалювання може бути реалізовано на вашій власності. Цей важливий ресурс має життєво важливе значення для захисту та заохочення того, як ми голосуємо, тому переконайтеся, що ті, хто перебуває на посаді, знають, що це питання має значення для вас.<br/>Мішель Міллер, «Фермерська крихітка», є міжнародно визнаним провідним спікером, письменником і впливовим у соціальних мережах і подорожує повний час, щоб виступати за сільське господарство.

| The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I – Book Review<br/>The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I: Battalion Histories Based on Official Documents. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 pages, photographs, maps. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>The Fourth Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, was one of the more famous combat units in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. Consisting of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion (Marine), the Fourth Brigade went through five main battles: Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont, and the closing days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.<br/>Clark, a former Marine and an author with many historical Marine Corps books to his credit, based this history largely upon official records. The book is not footnoted until Chapter 3, and then it is only sparsely footnoted. Thus, in most cases, we cannot know precisely where a given quote or information comes from. While we may assume that an operations report or field message is the origin of some data, there is nothing to tell us where we may find that information. Quotes, including entire block quotations, are left un-footnoted with no indication as to the origin of the material. Probably most of the information comes from the ten-volume Records of the Second Division, listed in the bibliography, which is grist for the Marine Corps enthusiast’s mill.<br/>The book is divided into eight chapters; the first chapter gives an overview of the Fourth Brigade’s history as a whole. Each of the rest of the chapters covers one of the battalions of the brigade, plus the brigade’s machine gun battalion. Each chapter is in turn arranged chronologically in a style reminiscent of a diary or log, with narrative falling under a given day or range of days. This arrangement makes for a disjointed overall history of the brigade; it is difficult to get the feel of how the battalions fit into the division’s role during a battle. The narrative falls into recording what seem like disjointed events without the benefit of broader context. Furthermore, the battalion/chapter arrangement ensures an amount of repetition because the same background must be repeated for each battalion, and each battle is “fought” seven times. There are many fine photographs included, and the maps are adequate, although I would prefer more maps with greater detail. Surprisingly, neither the photographs nor the maps are credited.<br/>With all that being said, it should be recognized that the author, an expert on this subject, has made an important effort to document the history of this brigade. The original sources, field messages in particular, capture the confusion and flavor of combat as experienced by the junior officers in the brigade. Historians interested in the Fourth Brigade are fortunate to have available an abundance of its field messages (or at least copies thereof). Readers who are not familiar with these messages will find those quoted in the book to be an enlightening window on the world of AEF combat.<br/>Likewise, there are some interesting tidbits to be gleaned from the extensive array of operations reports included. One example, which illustrated how the AEF learned “on the fly,” is a report written by Lt. Col. Frederick M. Wise, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, after fighting at Belleau Wood. Wise’s enumeration of twenty-three lessons learned is quoted in full and provides some interesting reading. What also comes through in these messages and reports is that, especially in the early battles, command and control issues plagued even the vaunted Marines. Platoons and companies became lost and diverged from their intended path as battalion commanders anxiously sought information via runners. It’s also interesting to see the degree of involvement at Belleau Wood by the brigade commander, Brigadier General James G. Harbord (US Army). Harbord wasn’t shy about sending messages directly to battalion and even company commanders, bypassing regimental commanders.<br/>Despite the issues and troubles, which were common to all units fighting in World War I, the 2nd Division succeeded in making an enviable record (although, it must be said, at a great cost in casualties). Most historians agree that it was one of the two best divisions in the AEF (the other being the First Division), and the Fourth Brigade did its part to earn that reputation. The success of the brigade can in part be attributed to the personal heroism of its officers and men. The author, probably using award citations or recommendations, has carefully recorded the heroic feats of individual Marines, soldiers, and Navy corpsmen; this is a valuable contribution to the history of the brigade and a fine tribute to brave men.<br/>This book will appeal to readers who are interested in the Marine Corps. For those who are not familiar with the 2nd Division, it might be helpful to first read a history of that division (for example, The Battery Press’s 1989 reprint of The Second Division, American Expeditionary Force in France, 1917-1919). That history, although a bit dry in places, will help put the action described in Clark’s book in context.<br/>Peter L. Belmonte is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and freelance historian. A veteran of Operation Desert Storm, he has written extensively on immigration and military history, and his current studies focus on the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. His most recent book, Days of Perfect Hell: The 26th U.S. Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, October-November, 1918, will be released by Schiffer Books in October. | Четверта бригада морської піхоти у Першій світовій війні<br/>Четверта бригада морської піхоти у Першій світовій війні: історія батальйону на основі офіційних документів. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 сторінок, фотографії, карти. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>Четверта бригада, частина 2-ї дивізії, була однією з найвідоміших бойових одиниць в американських експедиційних силах (AEF) Великої війни. Складаючись з 5-го і 6-го полків морської піхоти і 6-го кулеметного батальйону (морської піхоти), Четверта бригада пройшла через п'ять основних битв: Белло Вуд, Суассонс, Сент-Мішель, Блан-Монт і останні дні наступу Маас-Аргонн.<br/>Кларк, колишній морський піхотинець і автор з багатьма історичними книгами Корпусу морської піхоти, базував цю історію в основному на офіційних записах. Книга не згадується до глави 3, а потім вона лише рідко згадується. Таким чином, в більшості випадків ми не можемо точно знати, звідки походить дана цитата або інформація. Хоча ми можемо припустити, що звіт про операції або польове повідомлення є джерелом деяких даних, немає нічого, щоб сказати нам, де ми можемо знайти цю інформацію. Цитати, включаючи цілі цитати блоків, залишаються без позначення походження матеріалу. Ймовірно, більша частина інформації надходить з десятитомних записів Другого дивізіону, перерахованих у бібліографії, яка є джерелом для млина ентузіастів морської піхоти.<br/>Книга поділена на вісім розділів; перший розділ дає огляд історії Четвертої бригади в цілому. Кожен з решти розділів охоплює один з батальйонів бригади, плюс кулеметний батальйон бригади. Кожна глава, в свою чергу, організована хронологічно в стилі, що нагадує щоденник або журнал, з розповіддю, що підпадає під даний день або діапазон днів. Ця домовленість створює роз'єднану загальну історію бригади; важко відчути, як батальйони вписуються в роль дивізії під час битви. Наратив потрапляє в запис того, що здається роз'єднаними подіями без користі більш широкого контексту. Крім того, розташування батальйону / групи забезпечує кількість повторень, тому що один і той же фон повинен бути повторений для кожного батальйону, і кожен бій «бореться» сім разів. Є багато прекрасних фотографій включені, і карти адекватні, хоча я б віддав перевагу більше карт з більшою деталізацією. Дивно, ні фотографії, ні карти не кредитуються.<br/>При цьому слід визнати, що автор, фахівець з цієї теми, доклав значних зусиль для документування історії цієї бригади. Оригінальні джерела, зокрема польові повідомлення, відображають плутанину та колорит бою, який переживають молодші офіцери бригади. Історикам, зацікавленим у Четвертій бригаді, пощастило, що вони мають у своєму розпорядженні велику кількість її польових повідомлень (або принаймні їх копій). Читачі, які не знайомі з цими повідомленнями, знайдуть ті, які цитуються в книзі, просвітлюючим вікном у світ бою АЕФ.<br/>Крім того, є деякі цікаві факти, які можна почерпнути з широкого спектру операційних звітів. Одним з прикладів, який ілюструє, як AEF дізнався «на льоту», є звіт, написаний підполковником Фредеріком М. Уайзом, командиром 2-го батальйону 5-ї морської піхоти, після бою біля Белло-Вуд. Перерахування Вайзом двадцяти трьох отриманих уроків цитується в повному обсязі і дає деякі цікаві читання. Те, що також відбувається в цих повідомленнях і звітах, полягає в тому, що, особливо в ранніх битвах, питання командування і управління переслідували навіть хвалених морських піхотинців. Взводи і роти заблукали і відхилилися від запланованого шляху, оскільки командири батальйонів тривожно шукали інформацію через бігунів. Цікаво також побачити ступінь участі в Belleau Wood командира бригади, бригадного генерала Джеймса Г. Харборда (армія США). Харборд не соромився посилати повідомлення безпосередньо командирам батальйонів і навіть рот, оминаючи командирів полків.<br/>Незважаючи на проблеми і неприємності, які були спільними для всіх підрозділів, що воювали в Першій світовій війні, 2-й дивізії вдалося зробити завидний запис (хоча, треба сказати, при великій вартості втрат). Більшість істориків сходяться на думці, що це була одна з двох найкращих дивізій в АЕФ (інша — Перша дивізія), і Четверта бригада зробила свій внесок, щоб заробити цю репутацію. Успіх бригади частково можна пояснити особистим героїзмом її офіцерів і солдатів. Автор, ймовірно, використовуючи нагородні цитати або рекомендації, ретельно зафіксував героїчні подвиги окремих морських піхотинців, солдатів і корпусників ВМС; це цінний внесок в історію бригади і прекрасна данина мужнім чоловікам.<br/>Ця книга сподобається читачам, які цікавляться морською піхотою. Для тих, хто не знайомий з 2-ю дивізією, було б корисно спочатку прочитати історію цієї дивізії (наприклад, перевидання The Battery Press 1989 року The Second Division, American Expeditionary Force in France, 1917-1919). Ця історія, хоча і трохи суха в деяких місцях, допоможе поставити дію, описану в книзі Кларка, в контекст.<br/>Пітер Л. Бельмонте — офіцер ВПС США у відставці та історик-фрілансер. Ветеран операції «Буря в пустелі», він багато писав про імміграцію та військову історію, а його поточні дослідження зосереджені на американських експедиційних силах у Першій світовій війні. Його остання книга «Дні ідеального пекла: 26-й піхотний полк США в наступі Маас-Аргонн, жовтень-листопад 1918 року» буде випущена видавництвом Schiffer Books у жовтні. |
