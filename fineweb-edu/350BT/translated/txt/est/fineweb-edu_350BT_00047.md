| There are many various difficulties in each of manual assembly and surface mount technology within soldering. For manual assembly a variety of these problems include disturbed joints which is when the solder moves as it’s solidifying. Another problem that commonly occurs is a ‘cold joint’ where the solder has been removed from the board too early and has not been allowed to melt properly. Another frequent problem is an overheated joint, which is where the solder has not yet flowed and the residue of the burnt flux makes this joint hard to fix.<br/>Insufficient wetting is when the solder has wet the leads but then has not went on to form a good bond with the pad. There are also many problems with surface mount technology these include, solder balls which are mainly caused by poor process conditions which could include someone moving the board while the solder is settling. Another is solder beads which can occur when the reflow ramp up is either too fast or too slow. A further problem is bridging which can occur both due to hot slumping and cold slumping. As well as this another common problem is tombstoning which is most commonly caused by unequal components placement on the board before reflow results in unbalanced solder forces. Circuit boards are made up of extremely sensitive components, and moving them about in a careless manner will almost certainly cause the circuit board to break and no longer usable, especially putting tension on the small components, static electricity damages boards completely so the best way to prevent damage is to keep any sort of static electricity near the board to a minimum and discharge any static charge that has been built up in the circuit over time and hold the circuit board with care. While transporting boards you should wear rubber soled shoes in order to ground yourself before handling a board.<br/>We Will Write a Custom Essay Specifically<br/>For You For Only $13.90/page!<br/>When you are in control of circuit boards you should make sure the humidity within your workspace is higher than normal as static electricity builds up much more and much faster in low humidity and in dry air. Also you are recommended to put on gloves to handle a circuit board. Solder paste is a material used in the creation of printed circuit boards to join surface mount components to pads on the board, it is also possible to solder through hole pin in paste components by printing solder paste over the holes. There are three kinds of solder paste deposition these are Step stencil which have the possibility of soldering all chip component types into cavities, also has a low cycle time and more space for different depths, the other kind is dispensing which has the possibility of soldering all chip component types into cavities, the cycle time of this depends on the needle which is used to create dispensed dot sizes and the third and final type is jetting, a jetting machine is capable for processes and for different volumes, a jetting machine is designed to feed a and place machine and can sometimes mount 40,000 components an hour. The most appropriate and cost effective method to use will depend on the final product confirmation since each method each have its own limitations in terms of capability to support design features or cycle time. Transferring solder paste in high density cavities is a process that can be done with high quality and capable of achieving IPC-610 class.<br/>A pick and place machine helps with the assembly of circuit boards by automating of whereof small surfaces mount components on to boards, which then removes the process of manually planning and soldering small components while using pick and place preparation is key throughout soldering, solder paste must be applied to the solder pads of the board before operating the machine. Companies tend to use a laser cut vinyl strider as a mask with holds cut over the solder pads. Then with the mask on the board, solder paste can be forced onto the solder pads. The pick and place machine does exactly what the name states, it picks up the components and places them in a specified location. Solder paste is applied to the board before they are placed into the machine. Once the machine has placed the components the solder paste holds the components in place while the band is transferred to an oven.<br/>When the solder paste is melted, reflowed and then cooled, permanent solder joints are created at each component, completing the process. Also the pick and place machine does not require an air compressor as it has a vacuum and pump within the machine. | On palju erinevaid raskusi iga käsitsi kokkupanek ja pinnale paigaldamise tehnoloogia jooksul jootmine. Käsitsi kokkupanek erinevaid neid probleeme hulka häiritud liigesed, mis on siis, kui jootmine liigub, kui see on tahkestumist. Teine levinud probleem on "külm liigend", kus jootmine on laualt liiga vara eemaldatud ja ei ole lubatud korralikult sulada. Teine sagedane probleem on ülekuumenenud liigend, mis on koht, kus jootmine ei ole veel voolanud ja põlenud voolu jääk muudab selle liigese raskesti fikseeritavaks.<br/>Ebapiisav niisutamine on siis, kui jooteaine on juhtmed märganud, kuid ei ole seejärel padjaga head sidet moodustanud. Pinnale paigaldamise tehnoloogiaga on ka palju probleeme, mille hulka kuuluvad jootepallid, mis on peamiselt põhjustatud halbadest protsessitingimustest, mis võivad sisaldada kedagi, kes liigub pardal, kui jootmine on lahendatud. Teine on jootehelmed, mis võivad tekkida siis, kui tagasivoolu kaldtee on kas liiga kiire või liiga aeglane. Teine probleem on sild, mis võib tekkida nii kuuma kui ka külma languse tõttu. Nagu ka see teine levinud probleem on hauakivide, mis on kõige sagedamini põhjustatud ebavõrdne komponentide paigutus pardal enne reflow tulemuseks tasakaalustamata jootmise jõud. Circuit plaadid koosnevad väga tundlikest komponentidest ja nende hoolimatu liikumine põhjustab peaaegu kindlasti vooluahela purunemist ja ei ole enam kasutatav, eriti väikeste komponentide pingestamine, staatilise elektri kahjustuste plaadid täielikult, nii et parim viis kahjustuste vältimiseks on hoida mis tahes staatiline elekter plaadi lähedal minimaalselt ja tühjendada staatiline laeng, mis on vooluahelas aja jooksul üles ehitatud ja hoida vooluahelat hooldusega. Tahvlite transportimisel peaksite kandma kummist soled kingad, et maandada ennast enne laua käitlemist.<br/>Me kirjutame kohandatud essee konkreetselt<br/>Teile Ainult $13.90 / lehekülg!<br/>Kui teil on kontroll trükkplaatide üle, peaksite veenduma, et teie tööruumi niiskus on tavalisest kõrgem, kuna staatiline elekter koguneb madala õhuniiskuse ja kuiva õhu korral palju kiiremini. Samuti on soovitatav kanda kindaid, et käidelda trükkplaati. Jootepasta on materjal, mida kasutatakse trükkplaatide loomisel, et ühendada pinnale paigaldatavaid komponente plaadi padjakestega, samuti on võimalik joota läbi kleepsude komponentide aukude kaudu jootepasta trükkimisega.

Suure tihedusega õõnsustes jootepasta ülekandmine on protsess, mida saab teha kõrge kvaliteediga ja mis on võimeline saavutama IPC-610 klassi.<br/>Kogumis- ja paigaldusmasin aitab trükkplaatide kokkupanekul, automatiseerides, kust väikesed pinnad paigaldavad komponente plaatidele, mis seejärel eemaldab väikeste komponentide käsitsi planeerimise ja jootmise protsessi, kasutades kogu jootmise ajal võti ja koht ettevalmistamine, jootepasta tuleb enne masina kasutamist rakendada plaadi jootepadjadele. Ettevõtted kipuvad kasutama laser lõigatud vinüül trimmer maski hoidikud lõigatud üle jootepadjad. Siis mask pardal, jootepasta saab sundida peale jootepadjad. Kogumis- ja asetamismasin teeb täpselt seda, mida nimi ütleb, see korjab komponendid üles ja asetab need kindlaksmääratud asukohta. Enne masinasse paigutamist kantakse tahvlile jootepasta. Kui masin on komponendid paigutanud, hoiab jootepasta komponente paigal, samal ajal kui lint viiakse ahju.<br/>Kui jootepasta sulab, voolab uuesti ja seejärel jahutatakse, luuakse igale komponendile püsivad jooteühendused, mis viivad protsessi lõpule. Samuti ei vaja kogumis- ja asetamismasin õhukompressorit, kuna sellel on vaakum ja pump masina sees. |
| Or for that matter, why isn’t every new Moon a solar eclipse? We have a new Moon and full Moon every month, but eclipse seasons only twice a year. Why is that? It’s because the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun only twice a year and the Moon moves through the shadow of the Earth only twice a year. And, why is that?<br/>Sometimes the Moon is above or below the Sun, from our view, and sometimes the Moon is above or below the shadow of the Earth too. We do not have eclipses in either of these circumstances. Eclipses are all about our perspective and where the Moon is in regard to the Sun.<br/>A solar eclipse can only happen when the Moon is directly in front of the Sun, from our view down here on the Earth. The lunar eclipse can only happen when the Moon goes directly through the shadow of the Earth. These two phenomena only occur when the Sun and Moon are near the north and south nodes, meaning eclipses can only happen when the Sun and Moon are both near the nodes.<br/>What are the nodes anyway?<br/>The nodes are the intersection of the pathways of the Sun and Moon. Both the Sun and Moon have their own unique paths through our sky. When the Moon’s track crosses over the Sun’s track, also known as the ecliptic, that is when the eclipses appear.<br/>Check out this full Moon’s lunar eclipse image below, thanks to Stellarium.org, a free astronomy software program. (I like how they show the full Moon all reddish, at the peak of the eclipse!) The white circle is the path of the Moon. The yellow circle is the path of the Sun, the ecliptic. These circles cross over each other in two spots. Where they intersect represent the nodes of the Moon. See how the Moon’s and Sun’s circles are touching during this lunar eclipse?<br/>Now, look at the astrology chart of the lunar eclipse below. See the two horseshoe or headphone shaped glyphs? These two glyphs represent the nodes. They show, on the chart, where the two paths (of the Sun and Moon) cross over each other, from the astronomy image above. The Sun is near the south node and the Moon is near the north node.<br/>Also, notice how the chart maps exactly the astronomy in the image above. The Sun in the second house and the Moon in the eighth, just like in picture. Of course, this is from my Colorado perspective and yours would match your precise location. But, the cool part is to see that the chart (and all charts) are simply a map of the actual sky at that particular moment.<br/>Eclipses occur when the paths of the Moon and Sun meet – only. The rest of the year, all the new Moons and full Moons, their paths are too far apart for this perfect alignment of Moon and Sun to make an eclipse. Again, this is all about our earthly perspective. All three of us, Sun, Moon and Earth, have to align for an eclipse to occur. See what a special event an eclipse is? You already know that from seeing them, but now you understand the astronomy behind the specialness.<br/>One more cool fact… from our view the Moon appears to be the same size as the Sun, thus we are the only planet that can have a solar eclipse! Pretty amazing huh?!?<br/>Depending upon where you live, and if you have clear skies, I hope you can get outside and see the beautiful, magnificent Taurus lunar eclipse this Tuesday, November 8. Click this link to look for the times and viewing possibilities where you live. Regardless of whether you can visually see it or not, we’re all experiencing the energies.<br/>Blessings for your eclipse journeys! | Või muide, miks ei ole iga uus kuu päikesevarjutus? Meil on iga kuu uus kuu ja täiskuu, kuid eclipse hooaega ainult kaks korda aastas. Miks see nii on? See on sellepärast, et Kuu möödub otse Päikesest ainult kaks korda aastas ja Kuu liigub Maa varjus ainult kaks korda aastas. Ja miks see nii on?<br/>Mõnikord on Kuu meie arvates Päikesest kõrgemal või madalamal, ja mõnikord on Kuu ka Maa varjust kõrgemal või madalamal. Kummalgi juhul ei ole meil varjutusi. Eclipses on kõik meie vaatenurgast ja kus Kuu on Päikese suhtes.<br/>Päikesevarjutus võib toimuda ainult siis, kui Kuu on otse Päikese ees, meie vaatenurgast siin Maal. Kuuvarjutus võib toimuda ainult siis, kui Kuu läheb otse läbi Maa varju. Need kaks nähtust esinevad ainult siis, kui Päike ja Kuu on põhja- ja lõunasõlmede lähedal, mis tähendab, et varjutused võivad toimuda ainult siis, kui Päike ja Kuu on mõlema sõlmede lähedal.<br/>Mis need sõlmed üldse on?<br/>Sõlmed on Päikese ja Kuu radade ristumiskohad. Nii Päikesel kui ka Kuul on oma unikaalsed teed läbi meie taeva. Kui Kuu rada ületab Päikese raja, mida tuntakse ka ekliptikana, siis on see siis, kui eclipses ilmuvad.<br/>Vaadake seda täiskuu kuuvarjutuse pilti allpool tänu Stellarium.orgile, mis on tasuta astronoomiatarkvara. (Mulle meeldib, kuidas nad näitavad täiskuu kõik punakad, eclipse tippu!) Valge ring on Kuu tee. Kollane ring on Päikese tee, ekliptika. Need ringid ristuvad üksteisega kahes kohas. Kus nad lõikuvad, esindavad Kuu sõlme. Vaadake, kuidas Kuu ja Päikese ringid puutuvad selle kuuvarjutuse ajal kokku?<br/>Nüüd vaadake allolevat kuuvarjutuse astroloogia diagrammi. Vaadake kahte hobuseraua või kõrvaklappide kujulist glüüfi? Need kaks glüüfi esindavad sõlme. Nad näitavad kaardil, kus kaks teed (Päikese ja Kuu) ristuvad üksteisega ülaltoodud astronoomilise pildi järgi. Päike on lõunasõlme lähedal ja Kuu on põhjasõlme lähedal.<br/>Samuti pange tähele, kuidas diagramm kaardistab täpselt ülaltoodud pildil olevat astronoomiat. Päike teises majas ja Kuu kaheksandas, nagu pildil. Loomulikult on see minu Colorado vaatenurgast ja teie oma vastaks teie täpsele asukohale. Aga lahe osa on näha, et diagramm (ja kõik diagrammid) on lihtsalt kaardi tegelik taevas sel konkreetsel hetkel.<br/>Päikesevarjutused toimuvad siis, kui Kuu ja Päikese rajad kohtuvad - ainult. Ülejäänud aasta, kõik uued kuud ja täiskuud, nende teed on liiga kaugel, et Kuu ja Päike täiuslikult joondada, et teha eclipse. Jällegi on see kõik meie maise perspektiivi kohta. Kõik kolm meist, päike, kuu ja maa, peavad eclipse toimuma. Vaadake, milline eriline sündmus on eclipse? Te teate seda juba neid nähes, kuid nüüd mõistate astronoomiat erilisuse taga.<br/>Veel üks lahe fakt... meie arvates Kuu tundub olevat sama suur kui Päike, seega oleme ainus planeet, mis võib olla päikesevarjutust! Päris hämmastav ah???<br/>Sõltuvalt sellest, kus te elate, ja kui teil on selge taevas, loodan, et saate välja minna ja näha ilusat, suurepärast Tauruse kuuvarjutust sel teisipäeval, 8. novembril. Klõpsake seda linki, et otsida aegu ja vaatamisvõimalusi, kus te elate. Olenemata sellest, kas te näete seda visuaalselt või mitte, me kõik kogeme energiaid.<br/>Õnnistused teie eclipse reisidele! |

According to reports, the Bitcoin mining industry is very energy-intensive and produces C02 emissions equivalent to that of a small country.<br/>Of course, there is a political element to this hotly debated topic. Elon Musk has been heavily involved, having recently suspended Bitcoin transactions for his Tesla electric vehicles due to the increase in fossil fuels produced from mining Bitcoins. However, he has stated that Tesla plans to resume accepting Bitcoin, should mining the digital currency become cleaner.<br/>With everything that’s happened in recent weeks it’s clear that environmental impact could play a very important role in the future of cryptocurrency.<br/>So, is Bitcoin energy efficient? Let’s look at the facts and what possible solutions may be out there to address this issue.<br/>Mining Bitcoin refers to the creation of new Bitcoin. This is performed by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex maths problems or ‘cryptographic puzzles.’ Miners are rewarded with Bitcoin when they are able to solve these puzzles. This is a critical component of the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin blockchain.<br/>Bitcoin mining is not as good of an opportunity as it once was. The first Bitcoin miners were able to earn Bitcoins quite quickly using computers in their own home. These days, Bitcoin mining is dominated by companies with high computing power and large budgets.<br/>Read: Learn how to mine Bitcoin in Australia.<br/>A report done by Bank of America securities found that rising Bitcoin prices have led to a huge surge in CO2 emissions. Over the past 2 years, the emissions caused by Bitcoin mining have increased by over 40 billion tonnes. This is more carbon emissions produced than the entire country of Argentina in an equivalent amount of time, according to analysis undertaken by the University of Cambridge.<br/>This environmental impact has prompted a crackdown on Bitcoin mining, particularly in China. Considering that 65% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China, this could force Bitcoin mining to use cleaner energy. You can follow the power consumption of Bitcoin in real-time here.<br/>A substantial portion of Bitcoin mining is already being powered by renewable energy. The University of Cambridge predicts 39% of mining is powered by renewable energy, which is significantly higher than the share of renewables in global electricity production.<br/>As always, Elon Musk remains a hot topic in the crypto world. His on-again, off-again relationship with Bitcoin has been turbulent to say the least. In February 2021, Tesla sent the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing when it announced that it recently purchased A$1.9 billion of Bitcoin and planned to accept the digital currency as a means of payment for its electric vehicles. Musk was seen as the new darling amongst Crypto and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike.<br/>Fast forward a few weeks, and the narrative completely flipped. Firstly, news broke that Tesla has sold a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to reportedly ‘test’ its liquidity. However, the major turning point in this rollercoaster ride came when he announced on twitter that Tesla had suspended any purchases made with Bitcoin. The decision was made due to the concerns regarding the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.<br/>El Salvador has become the first country ever to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, marking a historic moment for cryptocurrency. Lawmakers in El Salvador’s Congress voted in favour of the new Bitcoin Law. This law means every Business must accept Bitcoin along with the US Dollar as legal tender for goods and services. This excludes business who are unable to afford or provide the technology to accept a Bitcoin transaction. This news resulted in a 5% jump in the price of Bitcoin shortly after being announced.<br/>El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, delighted Bitcoin enthusiasts even more when he tweeted that the countries volcanoes could be used as a renewable resource that would allow for “cheap” and “100% clean” Bitcoin mining.<br/>In another twist in the tale of Musk’s tumultuous relationship with Bitcoin, Tesla will reportedly resume accepting Bitcoin when miners can prove 50% energy usage. In his own words’ Musk stated, “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions.”<br/>Many promising concepts are being developed to drastically reduce the energy consumption of Bitcoin. Bitcoin developers are currently testing the Lightning Network, which is a Layer 2 solution that would reduce the energy demand of Bitcoin substantially. This works by moving a number of transactions off the main blockchain through a collection of nodes that routes payments through a payment network, similar to the Visa network.<br/>Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are both Proof of Work mechanisms which require a lot of electricity. However, new consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake could be a solution to the energy-intensive Proof of Work blockchains. Proof of Stake eliminates any need for mining which is the primary cause for the energy consumption. Ethereum is in the process of moving to Proof of Stake which will reportedly reduce energy demand by roughly 99%.<br/>You can buy Bitcoin (BTC) on Swyftx with low fees. | Loo oma tasuta konto<br/>Kasutage meie madalaid tasusid, madalaid hinnavahesid, madalaid hindu ja funktsioonidega pakitud rakendust, et avada oma kauplemis- ja investeerimispotentsiaal täna.<br/>Krüptoruumis on Bitcoini kaevandamise keskkonnamõju viimastel aastatel muret tekitanud. Aruannete kohaselt on Bitcoini kaevandamistööstus väga energiamahukas ja toodab C02-heiteid, mis on võrdväärsed väikese riigiga.<br/>Muidugi, seal on poliitiline element see kuum arutelu teema. Elon Musk on olnud tugevalt kaasatud, olles hiljuti peatatud Bitcoin tehingute tema Tesla elektrisõidukite tõttu kasv fossiilkütuste toodetud kaevandamise Bitcoins. Kuid ta on öelnud, et Tesla kavatseb jätkata Bitcoini aktsepteerimist, kui digitaalse valuuta kaevandamine muutub puhtamaks.<br/>Kõik, mis on juhtunud viimastel nädalatel on selge, et keskkonnamõju võib mängida väga olulist rolli tulevikus cryptocurrency.<br/>Niisiis, on Bitcoin energiatõhus? Vaatame fakte ja millised võimalikud lahendused võivad olla seal selle probleemi lahendamiseks.<br/>Mining Bitcoin viitab uue Bitcoin. Seda teevad suure võimsusega arvutid, mis konkureerivad lahendada keerulisi matemaatika probleeme või "krüptograafilisi mõistatusi." Miners premeeritakse Bitcoin, kui nad suudavad lahendada neid mõistatusi. See on Bitcoini blockchaini arendamise ja hooldamise kriitiline komponent.<br/>Bitcoin kaevandamine ei ole nii hea võimalus kui see kunagi oli. Esimesed Bitcoin kaevurid suutsid teenida Bitcoins üsna kiiresti kasutades arvutit oma kodus. Nendel päevadel, Bitcoin kaevandamise domineerivad ettevõtted, kellel on suur arvutusvõimsus ja suured eelarved.<br/>Loe lähemalt: Kuidas kaevandada Bitcoin Austraalias<br/>Aruanne tehtud Bank of America väärtpaberite leitud, et tõusvad Bitcoin hinnad on viinud tohutu tõusu CO2 heitkoguseid. Viimase 2 aasta jooksul, tekitatud heitkoguste Bitcoin kaevandamise on suurenenud üle 40 miljardi tonni. See on rohkem süsihappegaasi heitkoguseid kui kogu Argentina riik võrdväärse aja jooksul, vastavalt Cambridge'i ülikooli tehtud analüüsile.<br/>See keskkonnamõju on põhjustanud repressioon Bitcoin kaevandamise, eriti Hiinas. Arvestades, et 65% Bitcoin kaevandamise toimub Hiinas, see võib sundida Bitcoin kaevandamise kasutada puhtamat energiat. Bitcoini energiatarbimist saate jälgida reaalajas siin.<br/>Märkimisväärne osa Bitcoin kaevandamise on juba powered by taastuvenergia. Cambridge'i ülikool ennustab, et 39% kaevandamisest saab energiat taastuvatest energiaallikatest, mis on oluliselt suurem kui taastuvate energiaallikate osakaal ülemaailmses elektritootmises.<br/>Nagu alati, Elon Musk jääb kuum teema krüptomaailmas. Tema on-jälle, off-jälle suhe Bitcoin on olnud rahutu, et öelda vähem. Veebruaris 2021 saatis Tesla Bitcoini hinna tõusu, kui teatas, et ta hiljuti ostis 1,9 miljardit dollarit Bitcoini ja plaanis aktsepteerida digitaalset valuutat oma elektrisõidukite maksevahendina. Musk nähti uue kullake seas Crypto ja Bitcoin entusiastid nii.<br/>Kiiresti edasi paar nädalat, ja narratiiv täiesti pöördus. Esiteks, uudised purunesid, et Tesla on müünud osa oma Bitcoin osalused väidetavalt "testida" oma likviidsust. Kuid suur pöördepunkt see rollercoaster sõita tuli, kui ta teatas Twitteris, et Tesla oli peatatud kõik ostud tehtud Bitcoin. Otsus tehti muret seoses keskkonnamõju Bitcoin kaevandamine.<br/>El Salvador on saanud esimene riik kunagi vastu Bitcoin seadusliku maksevahendina, märgistades ajalooline hetk cryptocurrency. Seadusandjad El Salvadori Kongress hääletas uue Bitcoin seadus. See seadus tähendab, et iga ettevõte peab aktsepteerima Bitcoini koos USA dollariga kaupade ja teenuste seadusliku maksevahendina. See välistab ettevõtted, kes ei saa endale lubada või pakkuda tehnoloogiat Bitcoini tehingu aktsepteerimiseks. See uudis tõi kaasa Bitcoini hinna 5% hüppe varsti pärast selle väljakuulutamist.<br/>El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, rõõmustas Bitcoin entusiastid veelgi, kui ta säutsus, et riikide vulkaanid võiks kasutada taastuva ressursina, mis võimaldaks "odav" ja "100% puhas" Bitcoin kaevandamine.<br/>Teises keerdkäigus Muski tormilises suhetes Bitcoiniga jätkab Tesla väidetavalt Bitcoini aktsepteerimist, kui kaevurid suudavad tõestada 50% energiatarbimist. Oma sõnadega ütles Musk: "Kui kaevurite poolt positiivse tulevikusuundumusega mõistliku (~50%) puhta energia kasutamise kinnitus on olemas, jätkab Tesla Bitcoini tehingute lubamist."<br/>Paljud paljutõotavad kontseptsioonid on välja töötatud, et oluliselt vähendada energiatarbimist Bitcoin. Bitcoin arendajad on praegu katsetamine Lightning Network, mis on Layer 2 lahendus, mis vähendaks energianõudlust Bitcoin oluliselt. See toimib, liigutades mitmeid tehinguid peamisest plokiahelast läbi sõlmede kogumi, mis suunab makseid maksevõrgu kaudu, sarnaselt Visa võrgule.<br/>Blockchains nagu Bitcoin ja Ethereum on mõlemad Proof of Work mehhanismid, mis nõuavad palju elektrit. Kuid uus konsensus mehhanismid nagu Proof of Stake võiks olla lahendus energiamahukas Proof of Work blockchains. Tõend panusest kõrvaldab vajaduse kaevandamise järele, mis on energiatarbimise peamine põhjus. Ethereum liigub panuse tõestuseks, mis väidetavalt vähendab energianõudlust umbes 99% võrra.<br/>Bitcoini (BTC) saab osta Swyftxilt madalate tasude eest. |
| Laser cutting is a material-cutting technology that uses an intensely focused and coherent stream of light to cut metals. It’s a subtractive process that removes materials during the cutting process using vaporization, melting, and chemical ablation.<br/>While scientists have created lasers that use diamonds, their motives are, thankfully, not evil. That’s because they have created a next-generation laser with interesting capabilities.<br/>Researchers have succeeded in using diamonds to concentrate a flash of light into laser technology. They have demonstrated that a laser built with diamonds has comparable efficiency to a laser built with other materials. The incorporation of diamonds may have been done before. However, no one has ever done it with so much brilliance.<br/>The diamond laser technology has enough power to cut through glass. Note that synthetic diamonds are good thermal conductors and can remove heat from a laser cavity much faster and more effectively.<br/>This feature means that the diamond can be used to shift the wavelength emitted by the laser. This allows scientists to access new wavelengths or colors that are hard to produce by other methods.<br/>Cutting Glass With Laser Technology Using Diamonds<br/>Glass cutting is a technology used to weaken the glass structure along a score line that can be broken when force is applied. This separates the glass into sections along the score line. Regardless of the application, the cutting of glass is the same.<br/>The variations in the process are always in regard to the size of the sheet of glass amd the thickness. The important part of cutting glass is scoring a line of weakness that’s created in the glass and can be manipulated.<br/>A well-cut scoring makes it easy to separate the sections of glass. After the separation, the edges of your glass can be sanded, shaped, and smoothed.<br/>Let’s now find out how diamonds use laser technology to cut glass.<br/>When the cutting wheel crosses the glass surface, it fractures the surface to create a fissure. Even after rolling the wheel over the glass, you may not be able to see the fissure as it is nearly invisible. It can, however, be seen by looking into the glass and seeing a continuous band of reflected light.<br/>The important factors when cutting the fissure are the force and speed at which it’s completed. The amount of force is defined as the amount necessary to create the fissure. This can happen without crushing the glass surface. If the score becomes a white gritty line, it means that the amount of force has been exceeded.<br/>Note that the application of force needs to be uniform. This must be the case throughout the length of the score to create the correct fissure and to avoid crushing the glass. Remember that the variations in the force lead to various depths in the fissure, which can negatively affect the breakout.<br/>- Cutter Wheel Angle<br/>There are countless numbers of cutter wheel angles. That makes it difficult to determine the exact one for the cutting job. Most of the cutters have an angle between 120o and 124o. This is good for glass with a thickness of 0.063 inches to 0.093 inches.<br/>Flaking is common with any angled cutter. However, it can be avoided by oiling the score line or by using a cutter with an oil reservoir. Avoiding flaking is very important as it affects the characteristics of the fissure. This can cause chips during the breakout.<br/>Before you begin the breakout, it’s vital to tap below the score line. This will ensure that you carry the score completely through the fissure by using a roundhead copper or polyurethane paper. In some cases, this process creates the breakout if the score is exceptionally clean. Keep in mind that tapping blows must be right below the score line.<br/>The breakout must be started where the score ends. For better and easier control of the breakout, an anvil can be used with cut running pliers. The breakout must be done slowly and carefully as that will help to avoid excessive bending.<br/>The crucial part of the breakout is maintaining the smallest possible angle regardless of the methods used. You can use nipping pliers to break out narrow strips along the edge of the sheet. Cut running pliers have jaws specially designed to institute the breakout at the edge of the sheet. Grozing pliers do the nibbling and shaping of corners and edges.<br/>You must ensure that before cutting, the glass surface is cleared and cleaned along the line of the cut. As the glass cutting tool gets applied, its wheel must roll smoothly, evenly, and freely. This must happen as it makes direct contact with the glass to produce a proper fissure.<br/>Note that any fragments in the path of the wheel can weaken the fissure. When glass gets shipped, it gets covered in powder for protection. This must be removed before the cutting begins. Cleaning along the line of the cut with any kind of cleaner helps to get rid of the protective powder.<br/>Always remember that the fissure can only be scored once. That’s because multiple scorings of the glass can cause the glass to crack and break. Note that cutting glass is a delicate process that must be performed with the greatest amount of care.<br/>- Cutting Surface<br/>The type of work surface is the critical aspect of the glass cutting process. As such, you must ensure that it’s carefully selected.<br/>In professional cutting, optimum surfaces are prepared and designed for the completion of cutting. The best cutting surfaces are firm, flat, and free of any kind of dirt, debris, chips, or any form of imperfections. The surface must be sturdy, durable, resilient, and capable of withstanding the force that comes with cutting.<br/>The application of the cover material on the cutting surface should not be more than 0.0625 inches or 0.16 centimeters thick. Note that a thicker surface will interfere with the cutting process. A grid-cutting surface is recommended. That way, as the glass gets cut, silver and chips fall into the grid cells.<br/>When it comes to the cutting of glass, there are many ways through which you can make it happen. Despite there being simpler methods like using a glass cutter, when it comes to precision, laser cutting is preferred.<br/>Cutting glass using conventional methods works. However, complex shapes can’t be cut without significant time, effort, and wasted materials.<br/>In contrast, laser cutting glass can be done as easily as cutting plastic. But the kinds of devices that can be used to cut glass are fewer and more costly. As a result, there is limited consumer-level access.<br/>But as technology improves, newer and faster ways of cutting glass keep entering the market. Diamond-gritted bandsaws are now widely used in making curved cuts into thicker and harder glass.<br/>That was it for this article.

See on lahutav protsess, mis eemaldab materjalid lõikamisprotsessi ajal, kasutades aurustamist, sulatamist ja keemilist ablatsiooni.<br/>Kuigi teadlased on loonud teemante kasutavaid lasereid, ei ole nende motiivid õnneks kurjad. Seda seetõttu, et nad on loonud järgmise põlvkonna laseri, millel on huvitavad võimalused.<br/>Teadlastel on õnnestunud kasutada teemante, et kontsentreerida valgust lasertehnoloogiasse. Nad on näidanud, et teemantidest ehitatud laseril on võrreldav efektiivsus teistest materjalidest ehitatud laseriga. Teemantide lisamine võib olla varem tehtud. Kuid keegi pole seda kunagi teinud nii palju geniaalsust.<br/>Teemant laser tehnoloogia on piisavalt võimsust, et lõigata läbi klaasi. Pange tähele, et sünteetilised teemandid on head soojusjuhid ja võivad eemaldada soojuse laser õõnsus palju kiiremini ja tõhusamalt.<br/>See funktsioon tähendab, et teemanti saab kasutada laseri kiiratava lainepikkuse nihutamiseks. See võimaldab teadlastel pääseda juurde uutele lainepikkustele või värvidele, mida on muude meetoditega raske toota.<br/>Klaasi lõikamine lasertehnoloogiaga, kasutades teemante<br/>Klaasi lõikamine on tehnoloogia, mida kasutatakse klaasi struktuuri nõrgestamiseks piki punktiirjoont, mida saab jõu rakendamisel murda. See eraldab klaasi sektsioonideks piki punktiirjoont. Sõltumata rakendusest on klaasi lõikamine sama.<br/>Protsessi variatsioonid on alati klaasi lehe suuruse ja paksuse suhtes. Lõikamise klaasi oluline osa on klaasis loodud nõrkuse rida ja seda saab manipuleerida.<br/>Hästi lõigatud skoor muudab klaasi sektsioonide eraldamise lihtsaks. Pärast eraldamist saab klaasi servi lihvida, kujundada ja siluda.<br/>Uurime nüüd, kuidas teemandid kasutavad klaasi lõikamiseks lasertehnoloogiat.<br/>Kui lõikeratas läbib klaaspinna, puruneb pind, et luua pragu. Isegi pärast ratta klaasi üle veeretamist ei pruugi te pragu näha, kuna see on peaaegu nähtamatu. Seda saab siiski näha, vaadates klaasi ja nähes pidevat peegeldunud valgusriba.<br/>Lõhe lõikamisel on olulised tegurid jõud ja kiirus, millega see on valmis. Jõu kogus on määratletud kui pragude loomiseks vajalik kogus. Seda saab teha ilma klaasi pinda purustamata. Kui skoor muutub valgeks jämedaks jooneks, tähendab see, et jõu kogus on ületatud.<br/>Pange tähele, et jõu rakendamine peab olema ühtlane. See peab olema nii kogu skoori pikkuses, et luua õige pragu ja vältida klaasi purustamist. Pidage meeles, et jõu variatsioonid põhjustavad pragude erinevaid sügavusi, mis võivad purunemist negatiivselt mõjutada.<br/>- Cutter ratta nurk<br/>Lõikamisratta nurki on lugematu arv. See raskendab täpse lõiketöö kindlaksmääramist. Enamiku lõikurite nurk on vahemikus 120o kuni 124o. See on hea klaasi paksusega 0,063 tolli kuni 0,093 tolli.<br/>Plekkimine on tavaline iga nurga all oleva lõikuriga. Seda saab siiski vältida, õlitades punktiirjoont või kasutades õlipaagiga lõikurit. Plekkimise vältimine on väga oluline, kuna see mõjutab prao omadusi. See võib põhjustada kiipe purunemise ajal.<br/>Enne purunemise alustamist on oluline koputada punktisumma joone all. See tagab, et kannate punktisumma täielikult läbi prao, kasutades ümarpea vask- või polüuretaanpaberit. Mõnel juhul loob see protsess purunemise, kui skoor on erakordselt puhas. Pea meeles, et koputades lööb peab olema paremal allpool skoorijoont.<br/>Breakout tuleb alustada, kui skoor lõpeb. Parem ja lihtsam kontrolli breakout, sääreluu saab kasutada lõigatud töötab tangid. Breakout tuleb teha aeglaselt ja hoolikalt, sest see aitab vältida liigse painutamine.<br/>Katkestuse oluline osa on säilitada võimalikult väike nurk, olenemata kasutatavatest meetoditest. Lehe serva kitsaste ribade purustamiseks saate kasutada pintsetid. Lõigatud jooksvad tangid on lõualuud, mis on spetsiaalselt ette nähtud lehe serva purunemise sisseseadmiseks. Grozing tangid teevad nurkade ja servade näksimist ja kujundamist.<br/>Peate tagama, et enne lõikamist puhastatakse klaasi pind ja puhastatakse piki lõikamise joont. Klaasi lõikamise tööriista rakendamisel peab selle ratas rullima sujuvalt, ühtlaselt ja vabalt. See peab toimuma, kuna see puutub klaasiga otse kokku, et tekitada nõuetekohane pragu.<br/>Pange tähele, et kõik ratta teekonna fragmendid võivad pragu nõrgendada. Klaasi saatmisel kaetakse see kaitseks pulbriga. See tuleb enne lõikamist eemaldada. Puhastamine mööda lõikamise joont mis tahes puhastusvahendiga aitab vabaneda kaitsvast pulbrist.<br/>Pidage alati meeles, et pragu saab lüüa ainult üks kord. Seda seetõttu, et klaasi mitmekordsed punktisummad võivad põhjustada klaasi pragunemist ja purunemist. Pange tähele, et klaasi lõikamine on delikaatne protsess, mis tuleb läbi viia suurima hoolega.<br/>- Lõikepind<br/>Tööpinna tüüp on klaasi lõikamise protsessi kriitiline aspekt. Sellisena peate tagama, et see on hoolikalt valitud.<br/>Professionaalses lõikamises on optimaalsed pinnad ette valmistatud ja mõeldud lõikamise lõpetamiseks. Parimad lõikepinnad on kindlad, tasased ja ilma igasuguse mustuse, prahi, laastude või mis tahes puudusteta. Pind peab olema tugev, vastupidav, vastupidav ja võimeline taluma lõikamisega kaasnevat jõudu.<br/>Kattematerjali pealekandmine lõikepinnale ei tohiks olla suurem kui 0,0625 tolli või 0,16 cm paksune. Pange tähele, et paksem pind häirib lõikamisprotsessi. Soovitatav on võre lõikamispind. Nii, kui klaas lõigatakse, langevad hõbe ja kiibid võrgurakkudesse.<br/>Klaasi lõikamisel on palju viise, kuidas seda teha. Hoolimata lihtsamatest meetoditest, nagu klaasi lõikamine, kui tegemist on täpsusega, eelistatakse laserlõikust.<br/>Klaasi lõikamine tavapäraste meetoditega töötab. Kuid keerulisi kujundeid ei saa lõigata ilma olulise aja, jõupingutuste ja raisatud materjalideta.<br/>Seevastu laserlõikusklaasi saab teha sama lihtsalt kui plasti lõikamine. Kuid klaasi lõikamiseks kasutatavad seadmed on vähem ja kallimad. Selle tulemusena on piiratud juurdepääs tarbija tasemel.<br/>Kuid tehnoloogia arenedes jõuavad turule uuemad ja kiiremad klaasi lõikamise viisid. Teemantkriipsuga lintsaed on nüüd laialdaselt kasutusel paksemate ja kõvemate klaaside kumerate lõikamiste tegemisel.<br/>See oli selle artikli jaoks.

| Mystery Of The Mona Lisa, A Talking Art By Leonardo da Vinci<br/>It took 10 years to finish it<br/>By Techno Trace - October 28, 2021 - In Blog, History<br/>Monalisa's painting has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world". Here are some facts about the picture<br/>- c. 1503–1506, perhaps continuing until c. 1517<br/>- Oil on poplar panel<br/>- Lisa Gherardini<br/>- 77 cm × 53 cm (30 in × 21 in)<br/>- Louvre, Paris<br/>Many archeologists assume that this painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Also, a lot of them believe that they were painted between 1503 and 1506.<br/>The world's most valuable painting is this Monalisa painting. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962<br/>Some historians believe Mona Lisa is a Self-Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci.<br/>This speculation is the biggest mystery we hear about the painting. a new book claims. American scholar Lillian Schwartz says in the book, Leonardo's Hidden Face, that computer studies of Leonardo's self-portrait "superimpose perfectly" with that of his most famous subject.<br/>Italy's National Committee for Cultural Heritage, a leading association of scientists and art historians, is undertaking the investigation. They think the artist who died in 1519 is buried at a French castle and plans to dig up his skull. Using CSI-style technology, they want to rebuild da Vinci's face. As Rosenfeld puts it, "The questions about who this woman is range from whether she is related to the Medici family, or she is the wife of a wealthy merchant in Florence, no one knows." "Or most outlandishly that she is a hidden self-portrait of Leonardo himself; that's a kind of theory that seems most outrageous but is still of interest," he says.<br/>According to various archeologists and recent studies, historians are speculating that Leonardo da Vinci painted himself but in a womanly way. However, more research needs to be done.<br/>It is a painting but not a canvas<br/>Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting. It was painted on poplar, a wood more frequently found in Lombardy than Tuscany. At this time, the painting has never been insured as it is considered priceless.<br/>Da Vinci's famous masterpiece is painted on a poplar plank.<br/>The mystery behind the smile of Monalisa<br/>A research team that includes a University of Cincinnati (UC) neurologist found that her smile was non-genuine because of its asymmetry.<br/>The secret behind the Mona Lisa is that the "happy" part of her smile is buried in a low spatial frequency pattern. So if you're not looking directly at her mouth, her smile looks cheerful. But when you look directly at her smile, parts of it disappear into the background.<br/>When it was painted over 500 years ago. In a paper published in the journal Cortex, researchers at the University of Cincinnati say Mona Lisa's smile from the early 16th-century portrait isn't genuine because of its asymmetry.<br/>If you stare at a glance at Monalisa's picture, you'll see her smiling, but if you look at her for the 2nd time you'll see there's a painful expression. Some historians say it's because of a method of maintenance that nobody knows. Others say it's just a mind game. The mystery behind it is still not revealed.<br/>cannot be bought or sold<br/>Guinness World Records lists Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa as having the highest ever insurance value for a painting. The French government-owned this painting. And this is considered the crown jewel of France's Louvre Museum. "Mona Lisa" belongs to the public, and by popular agreement, their hearts belong to her.<br/>According to French heritage law, the painting cannot be bought or sold.<br/>The broken backdrop<br/>Leonardo Da Vinci painted valleys, mountains, hills, a river, and a bridge as a backdrop to his famous painting. Some art historians believe the background is an imaginary view portraying an idealized landscape, while others assert that it depicts a specific place. The gauzy veil, Mona Lisa's hair, the luminescence of her skin – all are created with layers of transparent color, each only a few molecules thick, making the lady's face appear to glow, and giving the painting an ethereal, almost magical quality.<br/>The broken backdrop seems incomplete or visual painting. Why Leonardo da Vinci did this remains a mystery.<br/>In 2010, Silvano Vinceti, chairman of Italy’s National Committee for Cultural Heritage, claimed to have discerned letters minutely painted on Mona Lisa’s eyes: L and V, in the right eye, and perhaps C, E or B in the left. The Louvre responded that Vinceti’s letters were simply microscopic cracks in the paint.<br/>Da Vinci’s obsession<br/>Leonardo da Vinci was supposedly commissioned by the family to complete the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. “While painting her portrait, he employed people to play and sing for her, and jesters to keep her merry, to put an end to the melancholy that painters often succeed in giving to their portraits.” The result, Vasari said, was “a smile so pleasing that it was more divine than human."<br/>Da Vinci treated the painting as a living being. The reason behind his obsession is not clear. But historians think it helped him to feel less lonely.<br/>The story behind the eyebrows of Monalisa<br/>The Mona Lisa when Da Vinci painted her did indeed have eyebrows but that over time and over-cleaning have eroded them to the point that they are no longer visible. When you see the picture, you'll notice the picture does not have any eyelashes. In October 2007, Pascal Cotte, a French engineer, and inventor says he discovered with the high-definition camera that Leonardo da Vinci originally did paint eyebrows and eyelashes.<br/>Anyway, thank you so much for reading. I appreciate your time and effort. If you’ve any questions about this post then don’t deny your heart with a hesitation. I’m always open for any suggestions. Leave a clap if you like it. Every CLAP is your appreciation for my words.<br/>Share if you consider this important to someone.<br/>Have a great day 😊, Cheers! | Mona Lisa müsteerium, rääkiv kunst Leonardo da Vinci<br/>Kulus kümme aastat, et see valmis saada.<br/>By Techno Trace - Oktoober 28, 2021 - In Blogi, Ajalugu<br/>Monalisa maali on kirjeldatud kui "kõige tuntum, enim külastatud, kõige rohkem kirjutatud, kõige enam lauldud, kõige paroodilisem kunstiteos maailmas". Siin on mõned faktid pildi kohta<br/>1503–1506, võib-olla jätkus kuni 1517. aastani<br/>- Õli pappel paneelil<br/>Lisa Gherardini<br/>- 77 cm × 53 cm (30 × 21 tolli)<br/>Louvre, Pariis<br/>Paljud arheoloogid eeldavad, et see maal on ilmselt Itaalia aadlik Lisa Gherardini, Francesco del Giocondo naine. Ka paljud neist usuvad, et nad olid maalitud vahemikus 1503–1506.<br/>Maailma kõige väärtuslikum maal on see Monalisa maal. See hoiab Guinnessi maailmarekordit ajaloo kõrgeima teadaoleva kindlustuse väärtusega 100 miljonit dollarit 1962. aastal<br/>Mõned ajaloolased usuvad, et Mona Lisa on Leonardo da Vinci portree.<br/>See spekulatsioon on suurim müsteerium, mida me maali kohta kuuleme. uus raamat väidab. Ameerika õpetlane Lillian Schwartz ütleb raamatus "Leonardo varjatud nägu", et Leonardo eneseportree arvutiuuringud "ülitavad suurepäraselt" tema kõige kuulsama teemaga.<br/>Itaalia rahvuslik kultuuripärandi komitee, mis on juhtiv teadlaste ja kunstiajaloolaste ühendus, korraldab uurimist. Nad arvavad, et 1519. aastal surnud kunstnik on maetud Prantsuse lossi ja kavatseb kaevata oma kolju. Kasutades CSI-stiilis tehnoloogiat, tahavad nad taastada da Vinci nägu. Nagu Rosenfeld seda ütleb, "Küsimused selle kohta, kes see naine on, ulatuvad sellest, kas ta on seotud Medici perekonnaga või on ta Firenze jõuka kaupmehe naine, keegi ei tea." "Või kõige ebatavalisemalt, et ta on Leonardo enda varjatud autoportree; see on omamoodi teooria, mis tundub kõige ennekuulmatum, kuid on endiselt huvipakkuv," ütleb ta.<br/>Erinevate arheoloogide ja hiljutiste uuringute kohaselt spekuleerivad ajaloolased, et Leonardo da Vinci maalis ennast, kuid naiselikult. Kuid rohkem uuringuid on vaja teha.<br/>See on maal, aga mitte lõuend<br/>Mona Lisa on poolpikk portreemaal. See oli maalitud pappel, puit sagedamini leitud Lombardia kui Toscana. Sel ajal, maal ei ole kunagi kindlustatud, sest seda peetakse hindamatuks.<br/>Da Vinci kuulsa meistriteos on maalitud pappellauale.<br/>Müsteerium Monalisa naeratuse taga<br/>Uurimisrühm, kuhu kuulus ka Cincinnati ülikooli neuroloog, leidis, et tema naeratus ei olnud asümmeetria tõttu ehtne.<br/>Mona Lisa saladus on see, et tema naeratuse "õnnelik" osa on maetud madala ruumilise sageduse mustrisse. Nii et kui te ei vaata otseselt tema suud, näeb tema naeratus rõõmsaks. Aga kui sa vaatad otse tema naeratust, kaovad selle osad taustale.<br/>Ajakirjas Cortex avaldatud ajakirjas Cincinnati ülikooli teadlased ütlevad, et Mona Lisa naeratus 16. sajandi algusest pärit portreest ei ole selle asümmeetria tõttu ehtne.<br/>Kui te vaatate Monalisa pilti, näete tema naeratust, kuid kui te vaatate teda teist korda, näete valulikku väljendit. Mõned ajaloolased ütlevad, et see on hooldusmeetodi tõttu, mida keegi ei tea. Teised ütlevad, et see on lihtsalt mõistuse mäng, mille saladust pole siiani paljastatud.<br/>Ei saa osta ega müüa<br/>Guinnessi maailmarekordid loetlevad Leonardo da Vinci Mona Lisa, millel on maali suurim kindlustusväärtus. Prantsuse valitsus omas seda maali. Ja seda peetakse Prantsusmaa Louvre'i muuseumi kroonijuveeliks. "Mona Lisa" kuulub avalikkusele ja rahva kokkuleppel kuuluvad nende südamed temale.<br/>Prantsuse kultuuripärandiseaduse kohaselt ei saa maali osta ega müüa.<br/>Katkine taust<br/>Leonardo da Vinci maalis oma kuulsa maali taustaks orud, mäed, mäed, jõgi ja sild. Mõned kunstiajaloolased usuvad, et taust on kujuteldav vaade, mis kujutab idealiseeritud maastikku, samas kui teised väidavad, et see kujutab konkreetset kohta. Pehme loor, Mona Lisa juuksed, tema naha luminestsents - kõik on loodud läbipaistva värvi kihtidega, millest igaüks on vaid paar molekuli paks, muutes daami näo säravaks ja andes maalile eeterliku, peaaegu maagilise kvaliteedi.<br/>Murtud taust tundub puudulik või visuaalne maal. Miks Leonardo da Vinci seda tegi, jääb saladuseks.<br/>2010. aastal väitis Itaalia rahvusliku kultuuripärandi komitee esimees Silvano Vinceti, et Mona Lisa silmadele on värvitud kirjad: L ja V paremas silmas ja võib-olla C, E või B vasakul. Louvre vastas, et Vinceti kirjad olid lihtsalt mikroskoopilised praod värvis.<br/>Da Vinci kinnisidee<br/>Leonardo da Vinci oli väidetavalt tellitud pere lõpetada portree Lisa del Giocondo. Tema portreed maalides kasutas ta inimesi tema jaoks mängimiseks ja laulmiseks ning narrid, et hoida teda rõõmsana, et teha lõpp melanhooliale, mida kunstnikud sageli oma portreedele annavad. Vasari ütles, et tulemus oli "naeratus, mis oli nii meeldiv, et see oli jumalik kui inimene."<br/>Da Vinci kohtles maali kui elusolendit. Tema kinnisidee põhjus ei ole selge. Kuid ajaloolased arvavad, et see aitas tal tunda vähem üksildast.<br/>Lugu Monalisa kulmude taga<br/>Mona Lisa, kui Da Vinci maalis teda, oli tõesti kulmud, kuid aja jooksul ja ülepuhastus on neid nõrgendanud nii, et need ei ole enam nähtavad. Kui näete pilti, märkate, et pildil pole ripsmeid. 2007. aasta oktoobris ütles prantsuse insener ja leiutaja Pascal Cotte, et ta avastas kõrglahutusega kaamera abil, et Leonardo da Vinci algselt värvis kulmud ja ripsmed.<br/>Igatahes, tänan teid nii palju lugemise eest.

| In this three part series, The Art of Dress will explore the influence of one of the world’s most beautiful birds, the peacock, and one of its “Golden” ages of influence on fashion from 1894-1920.<br/>The brilliantly colored body and iridescent feathered train of the peacock—the male of the peafowl pavo species—has ensured its status as one of the world’s most beautiful birds. Immortalized in religion, myth, and folklore, peacocks from both species of the peafowl—the blue-bodied Indian and green-bodied Burmese—have proven to be sources of design inspiration in cultures the world over.<br/>Appreciated for centuries in the West for its beauty, but also as a symbol of exotic luxury, the male peacock has long been a recurring motif in women’s fashionable dress. This series will celebrate the peacock in women’s fashion, jewelry, and costume during a period when it infiltrated all areas of artistic expression. This period straddling the dawn of the new century provided a ripe climate for exploring not only the aesthetic appeal of the sinuous and beautiful creature, but also the fascinating worlds from which it came.<br/>The series will trace the peacock’s transition from a fashionable dress and accessory motif embraced by the Symbolist, Arts and Crafts, and Art Nouveau movements to its personification in the costumes of the greatest stars of the stage and screen during the 1910s.<br/>Part One: Fashioning the Peacock<br/>The peacock motif flourished in design during the end of the nineteenth-century, a time of heightened artistic expression in both Europe and America. After 1858, when Japan opened its doors to trade after years of isolation, images of the green peacock, depicted on various goods, came pouring into Europe. Responding to a lack of creativity in a growingly industrialized world, artists looked to sources, old and new, for inspiration. They embraced the green peacock found in Japanese imports but also the blue-bodied Indian peacock, and its white-bodied subspecies, as some one of their favorite subjects.<br/>During this period, women were often depicted alongside the colorful peacock or bejeweled in its iridescent feathers. In the image at left, the Symbolist painter Edgar Maxine employed the peacock in both a literal and a figurative sense. By depicting the peacock feather as a fashionable accessory, he is also alluding to the bird’s symbolic associations with pride and vanity. As the displaying peacock in the background demonstrates, the bird struts and shows off in an effort to find a mate. “Peacocking” was used to describe men, and occasionally women, who were observed to do the same.<br/>The peacock provided adornment to feminine beauty that naturally translated into dress. Couturiers used the peacock motif in some of their most spectacular designs. Jewelers of the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements immortalized the peacock in a variety of metals and precious stones and “peacock blue” became a fashionable color in dress and interiors. As the Buffalo Tribune noted in 1905: “Hats, gowns, cloaks, jewelry, household decorations, are all being affected by the peacock fad.” The same article recognized that “when the peacock comes into fashion it gets into every phase of it.”<br/>Below are featured six exquisite examples of the use of the peacock motif in fashion during this period.<br/>The peacock inspired haute couture in the tea gown by the House of Worth featured here. Although tea gowns were worn for informal entertaining in the privacy of a lady’s home, they were no less luxurious than their evening gown couterparts. In this gown, the pattern of peacock feathers emphasizes the sheen of the lustrous silk satin.<br/>A signifier of royalty in India, the peacock feather proved a fitting motif for this elaborately embroidered dress worn in 1903 by Lady Curzon, the American-born wife of the British Viceroy to India. The dress was worn to the State Ball of Delhi Durbar at which King Edward VII was proclaimed Emperor of India. It was designed and made by the House of Worth but embroidered by skilled craftsmen in India. Iridescent beetle wings were used to dot the “eyes” of the silver and gold peacock feather motifs.<br/>The green peafowl, or pavo muticus, is embroidered on this kimono by a leading Japanese export company. Originally from Burma (today’s Myanmar) in Central Asia, the green peacock found its way to Japan in the seventeenth century and became embedded in the country’s artistic traditions. In Japan, the peacock is a symbol of dignity and beauty; it is represented here alongside cherry blossoms, the eternal symbol for spring. In Europe and America, the Japanese kimono was especially fashionable as an informal at-home garment like the tea gown or dressing gown.<br/>“I want to be a living work of art,” the eccentric Italian aristocrat the Marquise Luisa Casati, is portrayed in a flurry of broad brush strokes and peacock feathers. The Marquise often employed the peacock as an accessory to her avant-garde fashions as well as to the dramatic costumes she wore to her many famous masquerade balls. At one ball, she wore a diadem of peacock feathers dripping with fresh chicken blood. At another, she appeared as a golden goddess leading a peacock on a leash.<br/>The Paris-based American designer Weeks makes the peacock itself—and not just its feathers—the center of attention on this dress. Embroidered on the bodice and screen-printed on the skirt, the peacock motif is highlighted against the streamlined silhouette of 1910. The peacock lent itself well to a new era in women’s fashion that embraced Asian influences.<br/>The London store, Liberty & Company opened its doors in 1875 at a time of heightened Japonism in Europe, and at first was solely dedicated to selling Asian wares. The company eventually expanded to selling fabrics and fashions of its own design. Both the coat and cape employ Liberty’s “Hera” pattern. The peacock was an intimate friend of the Greek goddess, who placed the many eyes of her faithful servant Argus on its tail. “Hera” was one of Liberty’s most successful fabrics and is still associated with the company today.<br/>Look for Part II next week!<br/>2 thoughts on “Revisiting the Art of the Peacock: A Golden Age, Fashion & Fantasy, 1894-1920, Part One”<br/>Beautifully written and very inspiring.

See uue sajandi koidiku periood andis küpse kliima mitte ainult käänulise ja ilusa olendi esteetilise kaebuse uurimiseks, vaid ka põnevate maailmade uurimiseks, kust see tuli.<br/>Seeria jälgib paabulind üleminek moodne kleit ja aksessuaar motiiv omaks sümbolist, Kunst ja käsitöö, ja Art Nouveau liikumised tema isikustamine kostüümid suurim tähed laval ja ekraanil ajal 1910.<br/>Esimene osa: Peacocki moodne kujundamine<br/>Peacocki motiiv õitses disainis 19. sajandi lõpus, kõrgendatud kunstilise väljenduse ajastul nii Euroopas kui ka Ameerikas. Pärast 1858. aastat, kui Jaapan avas oma uksed kaubandusele pärast aastaid kestnud isolatsiooni, tulid Euroopasse rohelise paabulinnu pildid, mis olid kujutatud erinevatel kaupadel. Reageerides loovuse puudumisele üha tööstuslikumas maailmas, otsisid kunstnikud inspiratsiooni allikaid, vanu ja uusi. Nad omaks roheline paabulind leitud Jaapani import, vaid ka sinine keha India paabulind, ja selle valge kehaga alamliik, nagu mõned nende lemmik teemasid.<br/>Selle aja jooksul kujutati naisi sageli värvilise paabulinga kõrval või bejeweled oma vikerkaarsulgedes. Vasakul asuval pildil kasutas sümbolistlik maalikunstnik Edgar Maxine paabulinga nii sõnasõnalises kui ka kujundlikus mõttes. Kujutledes paabulindu moes aksessuaarina, viitab ta ka linnu sümboolsetele seostele uhkuse ja edevusega. Nagu näitab taustal olev paabulind, näitab lind jalgu ja näitab, et püüda leida kaaslane. "Peacocking" kasutati kirjeldamaks mehi ja mõnikord naisi, keda jälgiti sama tegema.<br/>Peacock andis naiselikule ilule kaunistuse, mis loomulikult kleidiks tõlgiti. Couturiers kasutas mõnes oma kõige silmapaistvamas kujunduses paabulind motiivi. Juveeltoodete juugend ja kunsti ja käsitöö liikumised immortalized paabulind erinevaid metalle ja vääriskivid ja " paabulind sinine" sai moes värvi kleit ja interjööri. Nagu Buffalo Tribune märkis 1905. aastal: "Mütsid, kleidid, mantlid, ehted, kodukaunistused, kõik mõjutavad paabulind." Sama artikkel tunnistas, et "kui paabulind jõuab moesse, jõuab see selle igasse faasi."<br/>Allpool on toodud kuus peent näidet paabulind motiivi kasutamisest moes sel perioodil.<br/>Peacock inspireeritud haute couture tee kleit poolt House of Worth siin esitletud. Kuigi tee kleidid olid kulunud mitteametlik meelelahutus privaatsust daam kodu, nad olid mitte vähem luksuslik kui nende õhtukleit couterparts. Selles kleidis rõhutab paabulindude sulgede muster läikiva siidsatiini sära.<br/>India kuninglikkuse tähistaja, paabulind sulg osutus sobivaks motiiviks selle keerukalt tikitud kleidi jaoks, mida 1903. aastal kandis Lady Curzon, Briti asevalitseja Indias sündinud naine. Kleit oli kantud Delhi Durbari riigiballile, kus kuningas Edward VII kuulutati India keisriks. See oli kujundatud ja valmistatud Väärtuse koja poolt, kuid tikitud India oskuslike käsitööliste poolt. Hõbedase ja kuldse paabulindsulgede motiivide "silmade" punktimiseks kasutati vikerkaar-mardika tiibu.<br/>Roheline peafowl või pavo muticus on tikitud sellele kimonole juhtiva Jaapani ekspordiettevõtte poolt. Algselt Birmast (tänapäeva Myanmar) Kesk-Aasias leidis roheline paabulind tee Jaapanisse 17. sajandil ja sai riigi kunstitraditsioonidesse. Jaapanis on paabulind väärikuse ja ilu sümbol; siin on ta esindatud koos kirsiõitega, mis on igavene kevade sümbol. Euroopas ja Ameerikas oli Jaapani kimono eriti moes kui mitteametlik kodurõivas nagu tee kleit või kleit kleit.<br/>"Ma tahan olla elav kunstiteos," ekstsentriline itaalia aristokraat Marquise Luisa Casati, on kujutatud laiade pintslitõmmete ja paabulindude lõõmas. Marquise kasutas sageli paabulindu lisavarustusena oma avangardse moe ja dramaatiliste kostüümide jaoks, mida ta kandis oma paljude kuulsate maskeraadipallide jaoks. Ühel pallil kandis ta värske kana verega tilkuvaid paabulindu. Teisel korral ilmus ta kuldse jumalannana, kes juhtis paabulindu rihma otsas.<br/>Pariisis asuv Ameerika disainer Weeks muudab selle kleidi tähelepanu keskpunktiks paabulind ise ja mitte ainult selle suled. Rinnahoidjale tikitud ja seelikule ekraaniga trükitud paabulind on esile tõstetud 1910. aasta sujuva silueti vastu. Paabulind painutas end hästi uuele ajastule naiste moes, mis hõlmas Aasia mõjutusi.<br/>Londoni kauplus, Liberty & Company avas oma uksed 1875. aastal, ajal, mil Euroopas oli kõrge japonism, ja algselt oli see pühendatud ainult Aasia kaupade müügile. Ettevõte laienes lõpuks oma disaini kangaste ja moe müümisele. Nii mantel kui ka keep kasutavad Liberty "Hera" mustrit. Paabulind oli Kreeka jumalanna intiimne sõber, kes pani oma ustava teenija Arguse paljud silmad sabale. "Hera" oli Liberty üks edukamaid kangaid ja on siiani ettevõttega seotud.<br/>Vaata II osa järgmisel nädalal!<br/>2 thoughts on “Kuldne ajastu, mood ja fantaasia, 1894-1920, esimene osa”<br/>Ilusalt kirjutatud ja väga inspireeriv.

| The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized this Friday the emergency use of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years old.<br/>The FDA has released its decision three days after a scientific committee of that body recommended the use of the doses in minors in that population group. The agency indicated on its website that it based its authorization on the effectiveness of this vaccine, which is 90.7% to prevent COVID-19 among children of the aforementioned age group and also cited a study that indicates that “no serious side effects have been reported. “RELATED<br/>With a result of 17 votes in favor and one abstention, the committee had to vote on Tuesday “yes” or “no” to the question of whether the benefits of administering the two doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks. in minors between 5 and 11 years old. The vote was preceded by a debate about the safety of vaccines in minors, since in some cases they have been related to a heart condition called myocarditis, which involves inflammation of the heart.<br/>Expert Hong Yang, Risk-Benefit Assessment Advisor for the FDA Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, spoke of several possible scenarios regarding the evolution of the pandemic and in all of these cases she considered that the benefits of immunizing children outweigh ” clearly “the risks. Yang acknowledged that there is a theoretical risk of myocarditis, which is more present in those vaccinated, especially in young men, although for her it is possible that the benefits of immunization continue to be “strong”.<br/>A pediatrician from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, in English), Matthew Oster, presented during the session on Tuesday the data of a study of children between 12 and 17 years old, and highlighted that they have not detected higher rates of myocarditis caused by vaccines in that group. In May, the US gave the green light to the Pfizer injection for teens 12 and older.<br/>Oster explained that myocarditis can occur in minors with multisystem inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19. According to the CDC, although it is unknown what exactly causes this syndrome in which various parts of the body become inflamed, it is known that in many cases it occurs in children who had covid or who were close to a positive for the disease.<br/>For its analysis, the CDC followed the cases of 5,000 children with that syndrome related to the covid and, according to Oster, the agency “has not yet seen any signal” that connects it to vaccines. Specifically, the CDC identified 24 volunteers who had been immunized before contracting the syndrome, of which 18 had been infected with covid. “We have not seen high rates of MIS-C (as that myocarditis is known) associated with vaccines in infants and older children,” Oster said. | USA Toidu- ja Ravimiamet (FDA) kiitis reedel heaks Pfizeri / BioNTechi COVID-19 vaktsiini erakorralise kasutamise 5-11-aastastele lastele.<br/>FDA on avaldanud oma otsuse kolm päeva pärast teaduskomitee, et asutus soovitas kasutada annuseid alaealiste selles elanikkonnarühmas. Amet märkis oma veebisaidil, et ta tugines oma loa andmisel selle vaktsiini tõhususele, mis on 90,7% COVID-19 vältimiseks ülalnimetatud vanuserühma laste seas, ja tsiteeris ka uuringut, mis näitab, et "tõsiseid kõrvaltoimeid ei ole teatatud. "SUHTES KOHALDATAKSE<br/>17 poolthääle ja ühe erapooletu häälega pidi komisjon teisipäeval hääletama "jah" või "ei" küsimusele, kas Pfizeri / BioNTechi vaktsiini kahe annuse manustamisest saadav kasu kaalub üles riskid. hääletusele eelnes arutelu vaktsiinide ohutuse kohta alaealistel, kuna mõnel juhul on need seotud südamehaigusega, mida nimetatakse müokardiitiks, mis hõlmab südame põletikku.<br/>Ekspert Hong Yang, FDA biostatistika ja epidemioloogia büroo riski-kasu hindamise nõustaja, rääkis mitmest võimalikust stsenaariumist seoses pandeemia arenguga ja kõigis neis juhtumites leidis ta, et laste immuniseerimise kasu kaalub selgelt üles "riskid. Yang tunnistas, et on olemas teoreetiline risk müokardiit, mis on rohkem esinevad need vaktsineeritud, eriti noortel meestel, kuigi tema jaoks on võimalik, et kasu immuniseerimise on jätkuvalt "tugev".<br/>Haiguste tõrje ja ennetamise keskuste (CDC) lastearst Matthew Oster tutvustas teisipäevase istungi ajal 12-17-aastaste laste uuringu andmeid ja rõhutas, et nad ei ole selles rühmas tuvastanud vaktsiinide põhjustatud müokardiiti. Mais andis USA Pfizeri süstile rohelise tule 12-aastastele ja vanematele.<br/>Oster selgitas, et müokardiit võib esineda COVID-19 põhjustatud multisüsteemi põletikusündroomiga alaealistel. CDC sõnul, kuigi ei ole teada, mis täpselt põhjustab selle sündroomi, kus erinevad kehaosad muutuvad põletikuliseks, on teada, et paljudel juhtudel esineb see lastel, kellel oli kovid või kes olid haigusele positiivsed.<br/>Oma analüüsi jaoks jälgis CDC 5000 lapse juhtumeid, kellel oli see sündroom, mis oli seotud covidiga, ja Osteri sõnul ei ole agentuur veel näinud ühtegi signaali, mis ühendaks selle vaktsiinidega. Täpsemalt tuvastas CDC 24 vabatahtlikku, kes olid enne sündroomi nakatumist immuniseeritud, kellest 18 olid nakatunud kodadega. "Me ei ole näinud MIS-C (nagu müokardiit on teada) kõrget taset, mis on seotud vaktsiinidega imikutel ja vanematel lastel," ütles Oster. |
