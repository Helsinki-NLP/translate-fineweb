| There are many various difficulties in each of manual assembly and surface mount technology within soldering. For manual assembly a variety of these problems include disturbed joints which is when the solder moves as it’s solidifying. Another problem that commonly occurs is a ‘cold joint’ where the solder has been removed from the board too early and has not been allowed to melt properly. Another frequent problem is an overheated joint, which is where the solder has not yet flowed and the residue of the burnt flux makes this joint hard to fix.<br/>Insufficient wetting is when the solder has wet the leads but then has not went on to form a good bond with the pad. There are also many problems with surface mount technology these include, solder balls which are mainly caused by poor process conditions which could include someone moving the board while the solder is settling. Another is solder beads which can occur when the reflow ramp up is either too fast or too slow. A further problem is bridging which can occur both due to hot slumping and cold slumping. As well as this another common problem is tombstoning which is most commonly caused by unequal components placement on the board before reflow results in unbalanced solder forces. Circuit boards are made up of extremely sensitive components, and moving them about in a careless manner will almost certainly cause the circuit board to break and no longer usable, especially putting tension on the small components, static electricity damages boards completely so the best way to prevent damage is to keep any sort of static electricity near the board to a minimum and discharge any static charge that has been built up in the circuit over time and hold the circuit board with care. While transporting boards you should wear rubber soled shoes in order to ground yourself before handling a board.<br/>We Will Write a Custom Essay Specifically<br/>For You For Only $13.90/page!<br/>When you are in control of circuit boards you should make sure the humidity within your workspace is higher than normal as static electricity builds up much more and much faster in low humidity and in dry air. Also you are recommended to put on gloves to handle a circuit board. Solder paste is a material used in the creation of printed circuit boards to join surface mount components to pads on the board, it is also possible to solder through hole pin in paste components by printing solder paste over the holes. There are three kinds of solder paste deposition these are Step stencil which have the possibility of soldering all chip component types into cavities, also has a low cycle time and more space for different depths, the other kind is dispensing which has the possibility of soldering all chip component types into cavities, the cycle time of this depends on the needle which is used to create dispensed dot sizes and the third and final type is jetting, a jetting machine is capable for processes and for different volumes, a jetting machine is designed to feed a and place machine and can sometimes mount 40,000 components an hour. The most appropriate and cost effective method to use will depend on the final product confirmation since each method each have its own limitations in terms of capability to support design features or cycle time. Transferring solder paste in high density cavities is a process that can be done with high quality and capable of achieving IPC-610 class.<br/>A pick and place machine helps with the assembly of circuit boards by automating of whereof small surfaces mount components on to boards, which then removes the process of manually planning and soldering small components while using pick and place preparation is key throughout soldering, solder paste must be applied to the solder pads of the board before operating the machine. Companies tend to use a laser cut vinyl strider as a mask with holds cut over the solder pads. Then with the mask on the board, solder paste can be forced onto the solder pads. The pick and place machine does exactly what the name states, it picks up the components and places them in a specified location. Solder paste is applied to the board before they are placed into the machine. Once the machine has placed the components the solder paste holds the components in place while the band is transferred to an oven.<br/>When the solder paste is melted, reflowed and then cooled, permanent solder joints are created at each component, completing the process. Also the pick and place machine does not require an air compressor as it has a vacuum and pump within the machine. | Existuje mnoho různých obtíží v každé z ruční montáže a technologie povrchové montáže v rámci pájení. Pro ruční montáž řadu těchto problémů patří narušené klouby, což je, když se pájka pohybuje, jak je to ztuhnutí. Dalším problémem, který se běžně vyskytuje, je "studená spojka", kde byla pájka odstraněna z desky příliš brzy a nebylo jí dovoleno se řádně roztavit. Dalším častým problémem je přehřátý kloub, kde pájka ještě neprotékala a zbytek spáleného toku činí tento kloub obtížně fixovatelným.<br/>Nedostatečné smáčení je, když pájka namočí vodítka, ale pak se nevytvořila dobrá vazba s podložkou. Existuje také mnoho problémů s technologií povrchové montáže, mezi něž patří pájecí kuličky, které jsou způsobeny především špatnými podmínkami procesu, které by mohly zahrnovat někoho, kdo pohybuje deskou, zatímco pájka se usazuje. Dalším problémem je přemostění, které může nastat jak v důsledku horkého propadu, tak i studeného propadu. Stejně jako tento další běžný problém je tombstoneing, který je nejčastěji způsoben nerovnoměrným umístěním komponent na desce před přetečením vede k nevyváženým pájecím silám. Obvodové desky jsou tvořeny extrémně citlivými součástmi a jejich neopatrným pohybem téměř jistě způsobí, že se obvodová deska rozbije a již nebude použitelná, zejména napnutí malých součástí, statická elektřina zcela poškozuje desky, takže nejlepší způsob, jak zabránit poškození, je udržet jakýkoli druh statické elektřiny v blízkosti desky na minimum a vybít jakýkoli statický náboj, který byl vytvořen v obvodu v průběhu času a držet obvodovou desku s péčí. Při přepravě desky byste měli nosit gumové soled boty, aby se uzemnit před manipulací s deskou.<br/>Napíšeme vlastní esej konkrétně<br/>Pro vás za pouhých $13.90/strana!<br/>Když ovládáte obvodové desky, měli byste se ujistit, že vlhkost ve vašem pracovním prostoru je vyšší než obvykle, protože statická elektřina se hromadí mnohem více a mnohem rychleji při nízké vlhkosti a na suchém vzduchu. Také se doporučuje, abyste si nasadili rukavice, abyste zvládli obvodovou desku. Pájecí pasta je materiál používaný při vytváření desek plošných spojů, které spojují komponenty pro povrchovou montáž na podložky na desce, je také možné pájet přes otvory v pastových součástech tiskem pájecí pasty přes otvory. Existují tři druhy ukládání pájecí pasty jsou Step šablony, které mají možnost pájení všech typů součástek čipu do dutin, má také nízkou dobu cyklu a více prostoru pro různé hloubky, druhý druh je dávkování, který má možnost pájení všech typů součástek čipu do dutin, doba cyklu závisí na jehle, která se používá k vytvoření dávkovaných teček a třetí a konečný typ je tryskání, tryskací stroj je schopen pro různé procesy a čas cyklu. Nejvhodnější a nákladově nejefektivnější metoda bude záviset na konečném potvrzení produktu, protože každá metoda má svá vlastní omezení, pokud jde o schopnost podporovat konstrukční prvky nebo dobu cyklu. Přenos pájecí pasty v dutinách s vysokou hustotou je proces, který lze provést s vysokou kvalitou a schopný dosáhnout třídy IPC-610.<br/>Pick and place stroj pomáhá s montáží desek plošných spojů automatizací z nichž malé plochy připojit komponenty na deskách, které pak odstraní proces ručního plánování a pájení malých součástí při použití pick and place příprava je klíčová v celém pájení, pájecí pasta musí být aplikována na pájecí podložky desky před spuštěním stroje. Společnosti mají tendenci používat laserový řezaný vinylový strider jako masku s držáky řezanými přes pájecí podložky. Poté s maskou na desce může být pájecí pasta vynucena na pájecí podložky. Pick and place stroj dělá přesně to, co název uvádí, vyzvedne komponenty a umístí je na určené místo. Pájecí pasta se aplikuje na desku předtím, než jsou umístěny do stroje. Jakmile stroj umístí komponenty, pájecí pasta drží komponenty na místě, zatímco pás se přenáší do trouby.<br/>Když se pájecí pasta roztaví, přeteče a poté se ochladí, vytvoří se u každé součásti trvalé pájecí spoje, čímž se proces dokončí. Také pick and place stroj nevyžaduje vzduchový kompresor, protože má vakuum a čerpadlo uvnitř stroje. |
| Or for that matter, why isn’t every new Moon a solar eclipse? We have a new Moon and full Moon every month, but eclipse seasons only twice a year. Why is that? It’s because the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun only twice a year and the Moon moves through the shadow of the Earth only twice a year. And, why is that?<br/>Sometimes the Moon is above or below the Sun, from our view, and sometimes the Moon is above or below the shadow of the Earth too. We do not have eclipses in either of these circumstances. Eclipses are all about our perspective and where the Moon is in regard to the Sun.<br/>A solar eclipse can only happen when the Moon is directly in front of the Sun, from our view down here on the Earth. The lunar eclipse can only happen when the Moon goes directly through the shadow of the Earth. These two phenomena only occur when the Sun and Moon are near the north and south nodes, meaning eclipses can only happen when the Sun and Moon are both near the nodes.<br/>What are the nodes anyway?<br/>The nodes are the intersection of the pathways of the Sun and Moon. Both the Sun and Moon have their own unique paths through our sky. When the Moon’s track crosses over the Sun’s track, also known as the ecliptic, that is when the eclipses appear.<br/>Check out this full Moon’s lunar eclipse image below, thanks to Stellarium.org, a free astronomy software program. (I like how they show the full Moon all reddish, at the peak of the eclipse!) The white circle is the path of the Moon. The yellow circle is the path of the Sun, the ecliptic. These circles cross over each other in two spots. Where they intersect represent the nodes of the Moon. See how the Moon’s and Sun’s circles are touching during this lunar eclipse?<br/>Now, look at the astrology chart of the lunar eclipse below. See the two horseshoe or headphone shaped glyphs? These two glyphs represent the nodes. They show, on the chart, where the two paths (of the Sun and Moon) cross over each other, from the astronomy image above. The Sun is near the south node and the Moon is near the north node.<br/>Also, notice how the chart maps exactly the astronomy in the image above. The Sun in the second house and the Moon in the eighth, just like in picture. Of course, this is from my Colorado perspective and yours would match your precise location. But, the cool part is to see that the chart (and all charts) are simply a map of the actual sky at that particular moment.<br/>Eclipses occur when the paths of the Moon and Sun meet – only. The rest of the year, all the new Moons and full Moons, their paths are too far apart for this perfect alignment of Moon and Sun to make an eclipse. Again, this is all about our earthly perspective. All three of us, Sun, Moon and Earth, have to align for an eclipse to occur. See what a special event an eclipse is? You already know that from seeing them, but now you understand the astronomy behind the specialness.<br/>One more cool fact… from our view the Moon appears to be the same size as the Sun, thus we are the only planet that can have a solar eclipse! Pretty amazing huh?!?<br/>Depending upon where you live, and if you have clear skies, I hope you can get outside and see the beautiful, magnificent Taurus lunar eclipse this Tuesday, November 8. Click this link to look for the times and viewing possibilities where you live. Regardless of whether you can visually see it or not, we’re all experiencing the energies.<br/>Blessings for your eclipse journeys! | Nebo proč není každý nový Měsíc zatmění Slunce? Máme nový Měsíc a úplněk každý měsíc, ale zatmění roční období jen dvakrát za rok. Proč je to? Je to proto, že Měsíc prochází přímo před Sluncem jen dvakrát za rok a Měsíc se pohybuje stínem Země jen dvakrát za rok.<br/>Někdy je Měsíc nad nebo pod Sluncem, z našeho pohledu, a někdy je Měsíc nad nebo pod stínem Země také. Nemáme zatmění v žádné z těchto okolností. Zatmění je o naší perspektivě a o tom, kde je Měsíc vzhledem ke Slunci.<br/>K zatmění Slunce může dojít pouze tehdy, když je Měsíc přímo před Sluncem, z našeho pohledu zde na Zemi. K zatmění Měsíce může dojít pouze tehdy, když Měsíc prochází přímo stínem Země. K těmto dvěma jevům dochází pouze tehdy, když jsou Slunce a Měsíc v blízkosti severního a jižního uzlu, což znamená, že k zatmění může dojít pouze tehdy, když jsou Slunce a Měsíc v blízkosti uzlů.<br/>Co jsou vlastně ty uzly?<br/>Uzly jsou průsečíkem drah Slunce a Měsíce. Slunce i Měsíc mají své vlastní jedinečné cesty naší oblohou. Když se dráha Měsíce přetne přes dráhu Slunce, známou také jako ekliptika, to je, když se objeví zatmění.<br/>Podívejte se na obrázek zatmění Měsíce v úplňku níže, díky bezplatnému astronomickému softwarovému programu Stellarium.org. (Líbí se mi, jak ukazují úplněk celý načervenalý, na vrcholu zatmění!) Bílý kruh je cesta Měsíce. Žlutý kruh je dráha Slunce, ekliptika. Tyto kruhy se kříží na dvou místech. Kde se protínají představují uzly Měsíce. Podívejte se, jak se dotýkají kruhy Měsíce a Slunce během tohoto zatmění Měsíce?<br/>Nyní se podívejte na astrologickou tabulku zatmění Měsíce níže. Podívejte se na dva glyfy ve tvaru podkovy nebo sluchátek? Tyto dva glyfy představují uzly. Na grafu ukazují, kde se obě cesty (Slunce a Měsíce) kříží přes sebe, z astronomického snímku výše. Slunce je blízko jižního uzlu a Měsíc je blízko severního uzlu.<br/>Také si všimněte, jak mapa mapuje přesně astronomii na obrázku výše. Slunce ve druhém domě a Měsíc v osmém, stejně jako na obrázku. Samozřejmě, toto je z mého pohledu Colorado a vaše by odpovídalo vaší přesné poloze. Ale cool část je vidět, že graf (a všechny grafy) jsou prostě mapa skutečné oblohy v daném okamžiku.<br/>Zatmění nastane, když se cesty Měsíce a Slunce setkají – pouze. Zbytek roku, všechny nové Měsíce a úplňky, jejich cesty jsou příliš daleko od sebe, aby toto dokonalé vyrovnání Měsíce a Slunce mohlo způsobit zatmění. Opět je to všechno o naší pozemské perspektivě. Všichni tři, Slunce, Měsíc a Země, se musíme sladit, aby došlo k zatmění. Vidíte, jaká je zvláštní událost zatmění? To už víte, když je vidíte, ale nyní rozumíte astronomii, která stojí za zvláštností.<br/>Ještě jeden skvělý fakt... z našeho pohledu se zdá, že Měsíc je stejně velký jako Slunce, takže jsme jediná planeta, která může mít zatmění Slunce! Docela úžasné, co?!?<br/>V závislosti na tom, kde žijete, a pokud máte jasnou oblohu, doufám, že se můžete dostat ven a vidět krásné, nádherné zatmění měsíce Taurus v úterý 8. listopadu. Klikněte na tento odkaz a podívejte se na časy a možnosti prohlížení, kde žijete. Bez ohledu na to, zda to můžete vizuálně vidět nebo ne, my všichni zažíváme energie.<br/>Požehnání pro vaše cesty zatmění! |

According to reports, the Bitcoin mining industry is very energy-intensive and produces C02 emissions equivalent to that of a small country.<br/>Of course, there is a political element to this hotly debated topic. Elon Musk has been heavily involved, having recently suspended Bitcoin transactions for his Tesla electric vehicles due to the increase in fossil fuels produced from mining Bitcoins. However, he has stated that Tesla plans to resume accepting Bitcoin, should mining the digital currency become cleaner.<br/>With everything that’s happened in recent weeks it’s clear that environmental impact could play a very important role in the future of cryptocurrency.<br/>So, is Bitcoin energy efficient? Let’s look at the facts and what possible solutions may be out there to address this issue.<br/>Mining Bitcoin refers to the creation of new Bitcoin. This is performed by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex maths problems or ‘cryptographic puzzles.’ Miners are rewarded with Bitcoin when they are able to solve these puzzles. This is a critical component of the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin blockchain.<br/>Bitcoin mining is not as good of an opportunity as it once was. The first Bitcoin miners were able to earn Bitcoins quite quickly using computers in their own home. These days, Bitcoin mining is dominated by companies with high computing power and large budgets.<br/>Read: Learn how to mine Bitcoin in Australia.<br/>A report done by Bank of America securities found that rising Bitcoin prices have led to a huge surge in CO2 emissions. Over the past 2 years, the emissions caused by Bitcoin mining have increased by over 40 billion tonnes. This is more carbon emissions produced than the entire country of Argentina in an equivalent amount of time, according to analysis undertaken by the University of Cambridge.<br/>This environmental impact has prompted a crackdown on Bitcoin mining, particularly in China. Considering that 65% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China, this could force Bitcoin mining to use cleaner energy. You can follow the power consumption of Bitcoin in real-time here.<br/>A substantial portion of Bitcoin mining is already being powered by renewable energy. The University of Cambridge predicts 39% of mining is powered by renewable energy, which is significantly higher than the share of renewables in global electricity production.<br/>As always, Elon Musk remains a hot topic in the crypto world. His on-again, off-again relationship with Bitcoin has been turbulent to say the least. In February 2021, Tesla sent the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing when it announced that it recently purchased A$1.9 billion of Bitcoin and planned to accept the digital currency as a means of payment for its electric vehicles. Musk was seen as the new darling amongst Crypto and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike.<br/>Fast forward a few weeks, and the narrative completely flipped. Firstly, news broke that Tesla has sold a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to reportedly ‘test’ its liquidity. However, the major turning point in this rollercoaster ride came when he announced on twitter that Tesla had suspended any purchases made with Bitcoin. The decision was made due to the concerns regarding the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.<br/>El Salvador has become the first country ever to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, marking a historic moment for cryptocurrency. Lawmakers in El Salvador’s Congress voted in favour of the new Bitcoin Law. This law means every Business must accept Bitcoin along with the US Dollar as legal tender for goods and services. This excludes business who are unable to afford or provide the technology to accept a Bitcoin transaction. This news resulted in a 5% jump in the price of Bitcoin shortly after being announced.<br/>El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, delighted Bitcoin enthusiasts even more when he tweeted that the countries volcanoes could be used as a renewable resource that would allow for “cheap” and “100% clean” Bitcoin mining.<br/>In another twist in the tale of Musk’s tumultuous relationship with Bitcoin, Tesla will reportedly resume accepting Bitcoin when miners can prove 50% energy usage. In his own words’ Musk stated, “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions.”<br/>Many promising concepts are being developed to drastically reduce the energy consumption of Bitcoin. Bitcoin developers are currently testing the Lightning Network, which is a Layer 2 solution that would reduce the energy demand of Bitcoin substantially. This works by moving a number of transactions off the main blockchain through a collection of nodes that routes payments through a payment network, similar to the Visa network.<br/>Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are both Proof of Work mechanisms which require a lot of electricity. However, new consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake could be a solution to the energy-intensive Proof of Work blockchains. Proof of Stake eliminates any need for mining which is the primary cause for the energy consumption. Ethereum is in the process of moving to Proof of Stake which will reportedly reduce energy demand by roughly 99%.<br/>You can buy Bitcoin (BTC) on Swyftx with low fees. | Založ si svůj účet zdarma<br/>Využijte našich nízkých poplatků, nízkých spready, nízkých cen a aplikace nabité funkcemi a odemkněte svůj obchodní a investiční potenciál ještě dnes.<br/>V krypto prostoru, dopad na životní prostředí těžba Bitcoin byl důvod k obavám v posledních letech. Podle zpráv, těžební průmysl Bitcoin je velmi energeticky náročné a produkuje emise C02 ekvivalentní k malé zemi.<br/>Samozřejmě, že existuje politický prvek na toto žhavě diskutované téma. Elon Musk byl silně zapojen, který nedávno pozastavil transakce Bitcoin pro jeho elektrická vozidla Tesla kvůli nárůstu fosilních paliv vyrobených z těžby Bitcoins. Nicméně uvedl, že Tesla plánuje pokračovat v přijímání Bitcoinu, pokud by se těžba digitální měny stala čistší.<br/>Se vším, co se stalo v posledních týdnech, je jasné, že dopad na životní prostředí by mohl hrát velmi důležitou roli v budoucnosti kryptoměn.<br/>Takže je Bitcoin energeticky efektivní? Podívejme se na fakta a jaká možná řešení mohou být k řešení tohoto problému.<br/>Těžba Bitcoin odkazuje na vytvoření nového Bitcoin. To je prováděno vysoce výkonných počítačů, které soutěží o řešení složitých matematických problémů nebo "kryptografické hádanky". Těžaři jsou odměněni Bitcoin, když jsou schopni vyřešit tyto hádanky. Jedná se o klíčovou součást vývoje a údržby blockchainu Bitcoinu.<br/>Bitcoin těžba není tak dobrá příležitost, jak to kdysi bylo. První Bitcoin horníci byli schopni vydělat Bitcoins poměrně rychle pomocí počítačů ve svém vlastním domě. V dnešní době dominují těžbě Bitcoinu společnosti s vysokým výpočetním výkonem a velkými rozpočty.<br/>Přečtěte si, jak těžit Bitcoin v Austrálii.<br/>Zpráva provedená společností Bank of America cenné papíry zjistila, že rostoucí ceny Bitcoin vedly k obrovskému nárůstu emisí CO2. Za poslední 2 roky se emise způsobené těžbou Bitcoinu zvýšily o více než 40 miliard tun. To je více emisí uhlíku než v celé Argentině za stejnou dobu, podle analýzy provedené univerzitou v Cambridge.<br/>Tento dopad na životní prostředí vyvolal zásah proti těžbě Bitcoinu, zejména v Číně. Vzhledem k tomu, že 65% těžby Bitcoinu probíhá v Číně, mohlo by to donutit těžbu Bitcoinu k používání čistší energie. Zde můžete sledovat spotřebu energie Bitcoinu v reálném čase.<br/>Podstatná část těžby Bitcoinu je již poháněna obnovitelnou energií. University of Cambridge předpovídá, že 39% těžby je poháněno obnovitelnou energií, která je výrazně vyšší než podíl obnovitelných zdrojů na celosvětové výrobě elektřiny.<br/>Jako vždy, Elon Musk zůstává horké téma v krypto světě. Jeho on-opět, off-opět vztah s Bitcoin byl bouřlivý přinejmenším. V únoru 2021 Tesla poslala cenu Bitcoinu, když oznámila, že nedávno koupila Bitcoin za 1,9 miliardy dolarů a plánovala přijmout digitální měnu jako platební prostředek pro svá elektrická vozidla. Musk byl viděn jako nový miláček mezi nadšenci Crypto a Bitcoin.<br/>Rychle vpřed několik týdnů, a vyprávění zcela převrátil. Za prvé, zprávy zlomil, že Tesla prodala část svých Bitcoin držby údajně "testovat" svou likviditu. Nicméně, hlavní zlom v této horské dráze přišel, když oznámil na Twitteru, že Tesla pozastavila všechny nákupy provedené s Bitcoin. Rozhodnutí bylo učiněno kvůli obavám týkajícím se dopadu těžby Bitcoinu na životní prostředí.<br/>Salvador se stal první zemí, která kdy přijala Bitcoin jako zákonné platidlo, označující historický okamžik pro kryptoměna. Zákonodárci v El Salvador kongresu hlasovali ve prospěch nového zákona Bitcoin. Tento zákon znamená, že každý podnik musí přijmout Bitcoin spolu s americkým dolarem jako zákonným platidlem pro zboží a služby. To vylučuje podniky, které si nemohou dovolit nebo poskytnout technologii k přijetí transakce Bitcoin. Tato zpráva vyústila v 5% skok v ceně Bitcoinu krátce poté, co byla oznámena.<br/>Prezident Salvadoru Nayib Bukele ještě více potěšil nadšence Bitcoinu, když tweetoval, že sopky zemí by mohly být použity jako obnovitelný zdroj, který by umožnil "levnou" a "100% čistou" těžbu Bitcoinu.<br/>V dalším zvratu v příběhu Muskova bouřlivého vztahu s Bitcoinem bude Tesla údajně pokračovat v přijímání Bitcoinu, když těžaři mohou prokázat 50% spotřebu energie. Musk řekl: "Až bude potvrzeno rozumné (-50%) využívání čisté energie horníky s pozitivním budoucím trendem, Tesla bude pokračovat v povolování bitcoinových transakcí."<br/>Mnoho slibné koncepty jsou vyvíjeny drasticky snížit spotřebu energie Bitcoin. Bitcoin vývojáři jsou v současné době testování Lightning Network, což je vrstva 2 řešení, které by výrazně snížit poptávku po energii Bitcoin. To funguje tak, že přesune řadu transakcí z hlavního blockchainu přes sbírku uzlů, které směrují platby prostřednictvím platební sítě, podobně jako síť Visa.<br/>Blockchainy jako Bitcoin a Ethereum jsou oba mechanismy Proof of Work, které vyžadují hodně elektřiny. Nové konsenzuální mechanismy, jako je Proof of Stake, by však mohly být řešením energeticky náročných blockchainů Proof of Work. Proof of Stake eliminuje potřebu těžby, která je primární příčinou spotřeby energie. Ethereum je v procesu přechodu na Proof of Stake, který údajně sníží poptávku po energii zhruba o 99%.<br/>Můžete si koupit Bitcoin (BTC) na Swyftx s nízkými poplatky. |
| Laser cutting is a material-cutting technology that uses an intensely focused and coherent stream of light to cut metals. It’s a subtractive process that removes materials during the cutting process using vaporization, melting, and chemical ablation.<br/>While scientists have created lasers that use diamonds, their motives are, thankfully, not evil. That’s because they have created a next-generation laser with interesting capabilities.<br/>Researchers have succeeded in using diamonds to concentrate a flash of light into laser technology. They have demonstrated that a laser built with diamonds has comparable efficiency to a laser built with other materials. The incorporation of diamonds may have been done before. However, no one has ever done it with so much brilliance.<br/>The diamond laser technology has enough power to cut through glass. Note that synthetic diamonds are good thermal conductors and can remove heat from a laser cavity much faster and more effectively.<br/>This feature means that the diamond can be used to shift the wavelength emitted by the laser. This allows scientists to access new wavelengths or colors that are hard to produce by other methods.<br/>Cutting Glass With Laser Technology Using Diamonds<br/>Glass cutting is a technology used to weaken the glass structure along a score line that can be broken when force is applied. This separates the glass into sections along the score line. Regardless of the application, the cutting of glass is the same.<br/>The variations in the process are always in regard to the size of the sheet of glass amd the thickness. The important part of cutting glass is scoring a line of weakness that’s created in the glass and can be manipulated.<br/>A well-cut scoring makes it easy to separate the sections of glass. After the separation, the edges of your glass can be sanded, shaped, and smoothed.<br/>Let’s now find out how diamonds use laser technology to cut glass.<br/>When the cutting wheel crosses the glass surface, it fractures the surface to create a fissure. Even after rolling the wheel over the glass, you may not be able to see the fissure as it is nearly invisible. It can, however, be seen by looking into the glass and seeing a continuous band of reflected light.<br/>The important factors when cutting the fissure are the force and speed at which it’s completed. The amount of force is defined as the amount necessary to create the fissure. This can happen without crushing the glass surface. If the score becomes a white gritty line, it means that the amount of force has been exceeded.<br/>Note that the application of force needs to be uniform. This must be the case throughout the length of the score to create the correct fissure and to avoid crushing the glass. Remember that the variations in the force lead to various depths in the fissure, which can negatively affect the breakout.<br/>- Cutter Wheel Angle<br/>There are countless numbers of cutter wheel angles. That makes it difficult to determine the exact one for the cutting job. Most of the cutters have an angle between 120o and 124o. This is good for glass with a thickness of 0.063 inches to 0.093 inches.<br/>Flaking is common with any angled cutter. However, it can be avoided by oiling the score line or by using a cutter with an oil reservoir. Avoiding flaking is very important as it affects the characteristics of the fissure. This can cause chips during the breakout.<br/>Before you begin the breakout, it’s vital to tap below the score line. This will ensure that you carry the score completely through the fissure by using a roundhead copper or polyurethane paper. In some cases, this process creates the breakout if the score is exceptionally clean. Keep in mind that tapping blows must be right below the score line.<br/>The breakout must be started where the score ends. For better and easier control of the breakout, an anvil can be used with cut running pliers. The breakout must be done slowly and carefully as that will help to avoid excessive bending.<br/>The crucial part of the breakout is maintaining the smallest possible angle regardless of the methods used. You can use nipping pliers to break out narrow strips along the edge of the sheet. Cut running pliers have jaws specially designed to institute the breakout at the edge of the sheet. Grozing pliers do the nibbling and shaping of corners and edges.<br/>You must ensure that before cutting, the glass surface is cleared and cleaned along the line of the cut. As the glass cutting tool gets applied, its wheel must roll smoothly, evenly, and freely. This must happen as it makes direct contact with the glass to produce a proper fissure.<br/>Note that any fragments in the path of the wheel can weaken the fissure. When glass gets shipped, it gets covered in powder for protection. This must be removed before the cutting begins. Cleaning along the line of the cut with any kind of cleaner helps to get rid of the protective powder.<br/>Always remember that the fissure can only be scored once. That’s because multiple scorings of the glass can cause the glass to crack and break. Note that cutting glass is a delicate process that must be performed with the greatest amount of care.<br/>- Cutting Surface<br/>The type of work surface is the critical aspect of the glass cutting process. As such, you must ensure that it’s carefully selected.<br/>In professional cutting, optimum surfaces are prepared and designed for the completion of cutting. The best cutting surfaces are firm, flat, and free of any kind of dirt, debris, chips, or any form of imperfections. The surface must be sturdy, durable, resilient, and capable of withstanding the force that comes with cutting.<br/>The application of the cover material on the cutting surface should not be more than 0.0625 inches or 0.16 centimeters thick. Note that a thicker surface will interfere with the cutting process. A grid-cutting surface is recommended. That way, as the glass gets cut, silver and chips fall into the grid cells.<br/>When it comes to the cutting of glass, there are many ways through which you can make it happen. Despite there being simpler methods like using a glass cutter, when it comes to precision, laser cutting is preferred.<br/>Cutting glass using conventional methods works. However, complex shapes can’t be cut without significant time, effort, and wasted materials.<br/>In contrast, laser cutting glass can be done as easily as cutting plastic. But the kinds of devices that can be used to cut glass are fewer and more costly. As a result, there is limited consumer-level access.<br/>But as technology improves, newer and faster ways of cutting glass keep entering the market. Diamond-gritted bandsaws are now widely used in making curved cuts into thicker and harder glass.<br/>That was it for this article.

Je to subtraktivní proces, který odstraňuje materiály během procesu řezání pomocí vaporizace, tavení a chemické ablace.<br/>Zatímco vědci vytvořili lasery, které používají diamanty, jejich motivy naštěstí nejsou zlé. To proto, že vytvořili laser nové generace se zajímavými schopnostmi.<br/>Výzkumníkům se podařilo pomocí diamantů koncentrovat záblesk světla do laserové technologie. Dokázali, že laser postavený s diamanty má srovnatelnou účinnost jako laser postavený s jinými materiály. Začlenění diamantů mohlo být provedeno dříve, ale nikdo to nikdy neudělal s takovou brilantností.<br/>Technologie diamantového laseru má dostatek energie k proříznutí skla. Všimněte si, že syntetické diamanty jsou dobré tepelné vodiče a mohou z laserové dutiny odvádět teplo mnohem rychleji a efektivněji.<br/>Tato vlastnost znamená, že diamant může být použit k posunu vlnové délky vyzařované laserem. To vědcům umožňuje přístup k novým vlnovým délkám nebo barvám, které jsou obtížně vyrobitelné jinými metodami.<br/>Řezání skla s laserovou technologií pomocí diamantů<br/>Řezání skla je technologie používaná k oslabení struktury skla podél čáry skóre, která může být rozbita při působení síly. To odděluje sklo do sekcí podél čáry skóre. Bez ohledu na aplikaci je řezání skla stejné.<br/>Rozdíly v procesu jsou vždy s ohledem na velikost desky skla a tloušťku. Důležitou součástí řezání skla je bodování linie slabosti, která je vytvořena ve skle a může být manipulována.<br/>Dobře řezané bodování usnadňuje oddělení částí skla. Po oddělení mohou být okraje skla broušeny, tvarovány a vyhlazeny.<br/>Pojďme nyní zjistit, jak diamanty používají laserovou technologii k řezání skla.<br/>Když řezací kolo překročí skleněný povrch, rozbije povrch a vytvoří trhlinu. Dokonce i po převrácení kola přes sklo nemusíte být schopni vidět trhlinu, protože je téměř neviditelná. To však může být viděn při pohledu do skla a vidí nepřetržitý pás odraženého světla.<br/>Důležitými faktory při řezání trhliny jsou síla a rychlost, s jakou je dokončena. Množství síly je definováno jako množství potřebné k vytvoření trhliny. K tomu může dojít bez rozdrcení povrchu skla. Pokud se skóre změní na bílou čáru, znamená to, že bylo překročeno množství síly.<br/>Všimněte si, že použití síly musí být rovnoměrné. To musí být případ po celé délce skóre, aby se vytvořila správná trhlina a aby se zabránilo rozdrcení skla. Pamatujte, že rozdíly v síle vedou k různým hloubkám v trhlině, což může negativně ovlivnit breakout.<br/>- Úhel řezacího kola<br/>Existuje nespočetné množství úhlů řezacích kol. To ztěžuje určení přesného řezacího místa. Většina řezaček má úhel mezi 120o a 124o. To je dobré pro sklo s tloušťkou 0,063 palce až 0,093 palce.<br/>Vlnění je běžné u všech úhlových řezaček. Lze se mu však vyhnout naolejováním výsledkové čáry nebo použitím řezačky s olejovou nádrží. Vyhnout se odlupování je velmi důležité, protože ovlivňuje vlastnosti trhliny. To může způsobit čipy během breakout.<br/>Než začnete breakout, je důležité klepnout pod čáru skóre. To zajistí, že budete provádět skóre zcela přes trhlinu pomocí kulaté hlavy mědi nebo polyuretanového papíru. V některých případech tento proces vytvoří breakout, pokud je skóre výjimečně čisté. Mějte na paměti, že poklepání musí být přímo pod čárou skóre.<br/>Proražení musí být zahájeno tam, kde končí skóre. Pro lepší a snazší kontrolu proražení lze použít kovadlinku s řezanými běžícími kleštěmi. Proražení musí být prováděno pomalu a opatrně, protože to pomůže zabránit nadměrnému ohýbání.<br/>Klíčovou součástí breakoutu je zachování nejmenšího možného úhlu bez ohledu na použité metody. K proražení úzkých proužků podél okraje listu můžete použít štípací kleště. Řezané běžící kleště mají čelisti speciálně navržené tak, aby zavedly průlom na okraji plechu. Pálení kleští provádí okusování a tvarování rohů a okrajů.<br/>Musíte se ujistit, že před řezáním je skleněný povrch vyčištěn a vyčištěn podél linie řezu. Jak se skleněný řezný nástroj nanáší, jeho kolo se musí plynule, rovnoměrně a volně otáčet. To se musí stát, protože je v přímém kontaktu se sklem, aby se vytvořila správná trhlina.<br/>Všimněte si, že jakékoliv fragmenty v dráze kola mohou oslabit trhlinu. Když se sklo dostane, je pokryto práškem pro ochranu. To musí být odstraněno před zahájením řezání. Čištění podél linie řezu s jakýmkoliv čističem pomáhá zbavit se ochranného prášku.<br/>Vždy mějte na paměti, že trhlina může být bodována pouze jednou. To proto, že vícenásobné bodování skla může způsobit prasknutí a rozbití skla. Všimněte si, že řezání skla je delikátní proces, který musí být prováděn s největší pečlivostí.<br/>- Řezací plocha<br/>Typ pracovní plochy je kritickým aspektem procesu řezání skla. Jako takový musíte zajistit, aby byl pečlivě vybrán.<br/>Při profesionálním řezání jsou připraveny optimální povrchy, které jsou navrženy pro dokončení řezání. Nejlepší řezné plochy jsou pevné, ploché a bez nečistot, nečistot, třísek nebo jakékoli formy nedokonalostí. Povrch musí být robustní, odolný, odolný a schopný odolat síle, která přichází s řezáním.<br/>Aplikace krycího materiálu na řeznou plochu by neměla být větší než 0,0625 palce nebo 0,16 centimetrů. Všimněte si, že silnější povrch bude narušovat proces řezání. Doporučuje se řezná plocha mřížky. Tímto způsobem, jak se sklo rozřeže, stříbro a čipy spadnou do buněk mřížky.<br/>Pokud jde o řezání skla, existuje mnoho způsobů, jak to můžete provést. Navzdory tomu, že existují jednodušší metody, jako je použití řezačky skla, pokud jde o přesnost, je upřednostňováno řezání laserem.<br/>Řezání skla konvenčními metodami funguje. Komplexní tvary však nelze řezat bez značného času, úsilí a plýtvání materiály.<br/>Naproti tomu laserové řezání skla může být provedeno stejně snadno jako řezání plastů. Ale druhy zařízení, které lze použít k řezání skla, jsou méně a dražší. Výsledkem je omezený přístup na spotřebitelskou úroveň.<br/>Ale jak se technologie zlepšuje, na trh stále vstupují novější a rychlejší způsoby řezání skla. Diamantové pásové pily jsou nyní široce používány při výrobě zakřivených řezů do silnějšího a tvrdšího skla.<br/>To bylo vše pro tento článek.

| Mystery Of The Mona Lisa, A Talking Art By Leonardo da Vinci<br/>It took 10 years to finish it<br/>By Techno Trace - October 28, 2021 - In Blog, History<br/>Monalisa's painting has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world". Here are some facts about the picture<br/>- c. 1503–1506, perhaps continuing until c. 1517<br/>- Oil on poplar panel<br/>- Lisa Gherardini<br/>- 77 cm × 53 cm (30 in × 21 in)<br/>- Louvre, Paris<br/>Many archeologists assume that this painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Also, a lot of them believe that they were painted between 1503 and 1506.<br/>The world's most valuable painting is this Monalisa painting. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962<br/>Some historians believe Mona Lisa is a Self-Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci.<br/>This speculation is the biggest mystery we hear about the painting. a new book claims. American scholar Lillian Schwartz says in the book, Leonardo's Hidden Face, that computer studies of Leonardo's self-portrait "superimpose perfectly" with that of his most famous subject.<br/>Italy's National Committee for Cultural Heritage, a leading association of scientists and art historians, is undertaking the investigation. They think the artist who died in 1519 is buried at a French castle and plans to dig up his skull. Using CSI-style technology, they want to rebuild da Vinci's face. As Rosenfeld puts it, "The questions about who this woman is range from whether she is related to the Medici family, or she is the wife of a wealthy merchant in Florence, no one knows." "Or most outlandishly that she is a hidden self-portrait of Leonardo himself; that's a kind of theory that seems most outrageous but is still of interest," he says.<br/>According to various archeologists and recent studies, historians are speculating that Leonardo da Vinci painted himself but in a womanly way. However, more research needs to be done.<br/>It is a painting but not a canvas<br/>Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting. It was painted on poplar, a wood more frequently found in Lombardy than Tuscany. At this time, the painting has never been insured as it is considered priceless.<br/>Da Vinci's famous masterpiece is painted on a poplar plank.<br/>The mystery behind the smile of Monalisa<br/>A research team that includes a University of Cincinnati (UC) neurologist found that her smile was non-genuine because of its asymmetry.<br/>The secret behind the Mona Lisa is that the "happy" part of her smile is buried in a low spatial frequency pattern. So if you're not looking directly at her mouth, her smile looks cheerful. But when you look directly at her smile, parts of it disappear into the background.<br/>When it was painted over 500 years ago. In a paper published in the journal Cortex, researchers at the University of Cincinnati say Mona Lisa's smile from the early 16th-century portrait isn't genuine because of its asymmetry.<br/>If you stare at a glance at Monalisa's picture, you'll see her smiling, but if you look at her for the 2nd time you'll see there's a painful expression. Some historians say it's because of a method of maintenance that nobody knows. Others say it's just a mind game. The mystery behind it is still not revealed.<br/>cannot be bought or sold<br/>Guinness World Records lists Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa as having the highest ever insurance value for a painting. The French government-owned this painting. And this is considered the crown jewel of France's Louvre Museum. "Mona Lisa" belongs to the public, and by popular agreement, their hearts belong to her.<br/>According to French heritage law, the painting cannot be bought or sold.<br/>The broken backdrop<br/>Leonardo Da Vinci painted valleys, mountains, hills, a river, and a bridge as a backdrop to his famous painting. Some art historians believe the background is an imaginary view portraying an idealized landscape, while others assert that it depicts a specific place. The gauzy veil, Mona Lisa's hair, the luminescence of her skin – all are created with layers of transparent color, each only a few molecules thick, making the lady's face appear to glow, and giving the painting an ethereal, almost magical quality.<br/>The broken backdrop seems incomplete or visual painting. Why Leonardo da Vinci did this remains a mystery.<br/>In 2010, Silvano Vinceti, chairman of Italy’s National Committee for Cultural Heritage, claimed to have discerned letters minutely painted on Mona Lisa’s eyes: L and V, in the right eye, and perhaps C, E or B in the left. The Louvre responded that Vinceti’s letters were simply microscopic cracks in the paint.<br/>Da Vinci’s obsession<br/>Leonardo da Vinci was supposedly commissioned by the family to complete the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. “While painting her portrait, he employed people to play and sing for her, and jesters to keep her merry, to put an end to the melancholy that painters often succeed in giving to their portraits.” The result, Vasari said, was “a smile so pleasing that it was more divine than human."<br/>Da Vinci treated the painting as a living being. The reason behind his obsession is not clear. But historians think it helped him to feel less lonely.<br/>The story behind the eyebrows of Monalisa<br/>The Mona Lisa when Da Vinci painted her did indeed have eyebrows but that over time and over-cleaning have eroded them to the point that they are no longer visible. When you see the picture, you'll notice the picture does not have any eyelashes. In October 2007, Pascal Cotte, a French engineer, and inventor says he discovered with the high-definition camera that Leonardo da Vinci originally did paint eyebrows and eyelashes.<br/>Anyway, thank you so much for reading. I appreciate your time and effort. If you’ve any questions about this post then don’t deny your heart with a hesitation. I’m always open for any suggestions. Leave a clap if you like it. Every CLAP is your appreciation for my words.<br/>Share if you consider this important to someone.<br/>Have a great day 😊, Cheers! | Tajemství Mony Lisy, mluvící umění Leonardo da Vinci<br/>Trvalo deset let, než se to dokončilo.<br/>Podle Techno Trace - Říjen 28, 2021 - In Blog, Historie<br/>Monalisa malba byla popsána jako "nejznámější, nejnavštěvovanější, nejvíce psané o, nejvíce zpívané o, nejvíce parodované umělecké dílo na světě". Zde jsou některé fakta o obrázku<br/>- c. 1503-1506, možná pokračovat až do c. 1517<br/>- Olej na topolovém panelu<br/>- Lisa Gherardini<br/>- 77 cm x 53 cm (30 in x 21 in)<br/>- Louvre, Paříž<br/>Mnoho archeologů předpokládá, že tento obraz je pravděpodobně italské šlechtičny Lisy Gherardini, manželky Francesca del Gioconda. Také mnoho z nich věří, že byly namalovány mezi lety 1503 a 1506.<br/>Nejcennějším obrazem na světě je tento obraz Monalisa. Je držitelem Guinnessova světového rekordu pro nejvyšší známé ocenění pojištění v historii na 100 milionů USD v roce 1962<br/>Někteří historici věří, že Mona Lisa je autoportrét Leonarda da Vinciho.<br/>Tato spekulace je největší záhadou, kterou o obraze slyšíme. tvrdí nová kniha. Americký učenec Lillian Schwartz říká v knize, Leonardova skrytá tvář, že počítačové studie Leonardova autoportrétu "dokonale překrývají" s jeho nejslavnějším námětem.<br/>Italský Národní výbor pro kulturní dědictví, přední sdružení vědců a historiků umění, provádí vyšetřování. Myslí si, že umělec, který zemřel v roce 1519, je pohřben na francouzském hradě a plánuje vykopat jeho lebku. Jak Rosenfeld říká: "Otázky, kdo je tato žena, se pohybují od toho, zda je příbuzná s rodinou Medici, nebo je manželkou bohatého obchodníka ve Florencii, nikdo neví." "Nebo nejdivočejší, že je skrytým autoportrétem samotného Leonarda; to je druh teorie, která se zdá být nejvíce pobuřující, ale je stále zajímavá," říká.<br/>Podle různých archeologů a nedávných studií historici spekulují, že Leonardo da Vinci namaloval sám sebe, ale žensky. Nicméně je třeba provést další výzkum.<br/>Je to obraz, ale ne plátno<br/>Mona Lisa je polodlouhá portrétní malba. Byla namalována na topol, což je dřevo, které se v Lombardii vyskytuje častěji než v Toskánsku. V této době nebyl obraz nikdy pojištěn, protože je považován za neocenitelný.<br/>Da Vinciho slavné mistrovské dílo je namalováno na topolovém prkně.<br/>Tajemství za úsměvem Monalisy<br/>Výzkumný tým, který zahrnuje neurolog University of Cincinnati (UC), zjistil, že její úsměv nebyl pravý kvůli jeho asymetrii.<br/>Tajemství za Mona Lisa je, že "šťastná" část jejího úsměvu je pohřbena v nízkém prostorovém frekvenčním vzoru. Takže pokud se nedíváte přímo na její ústa, její úsměv vypadá vesele. Ale když se podíváte přímo na její úsměv, některé jeho části zmizí v pozadí.<br/>V článku publikovaném v časopise Cortex vědci z University of Cincinnati říkají, že úsměv Mony Lisy z portrétu z počátku 16. století není pravý kvůli její asymetrii.<br/>Pokud se podíváte na obrázek Monalisy, uvidíte, že se usmívá, ale když se na ni podíváte podruhé, uvidíte bolestivý výraz. Někteří historici říkají, že je to kvůli způsobu údržby, který nikdo neví. Jiní říkají, že je to jen hra na mysl. Záhada, která se za ní skrývá, stále není odhalena.<br/>nelze koupit ani prodat<br/>Guinnessova kniha rekordů uvádí, že Mona Lisa od Leonarda da Vinciho má nejvyšší pojistnou hodnotu za obraz. Tento obraz vlastnila francouzská vláda. A to je považováno za korunovační klenot francouzského muzea Louvre. "Mona Lisa" patří veřejnosti a na základě lidové dohody patří jejich srdce k ní.<br/>Podle francouzského práva nelze obraz koupit ani prodat.<br/>Rozbité pozadí<br/>Leonardo da Vinci maloval údolí, hory, kopce, řeku a most jako pozadí ke svému slavnému obrazu. Někteří historici umění se domnívají, že pozadí je imaginární pohled zobrazující idealizovanou krajinu, zatímco jiní tvrdí, že zobrazuje konkrétní místo. Gázový závoj, vlasy Mony Lisy, luminiscence její kůže – všechny jsou vytvořeny s vrstvami průhledné barvy, z nichž každá má jen několik molekul tlustých, takže se tvář dámy zdá zářit a dává malbě éterickou, téměř magickou kvalitu.<br/>Rozbité pozadí se zdá být neúplné nebo vizuální malbou. Proč to Leonardo da Vinci udělal, zůstává záhadou.<br/>V roce 2010 Silvano Vinceti, předseda italského Národního výboru pro kulturní dědictví, tvrdil, že na očích Mony Lisy rozeznal písmena: L a V, v pravém oku a možná C, E nebo B vlevo. Louvre odpověděl, že Vincetiho dopisy byly jen mikroskopické trhliny v barvě.<br/>Da Vinciho posedlost<br/>Leonardo da Vinci byl údajně pověřen rodinou, aby dokončil portrét Lisy del Giocondo. Zatímco maloval její portrét, zaměstnával lidi, aby pro ni hráli a zpívali, a šašci, aby ji udrželi veselou, aby ukončili melancholii, kterou malíři často úspěšně dávají svým portrétům. Výsledkem byl podle Vasariho "úsměv tak příjemný, že byl více božský než lidský".<br/>Da Vinci s obrazem zacházel jako s živou bytostí. Důvod jeho posedlosti není jasný. Historici si však myslí, že mu to pomohlo cítit se méně osaměle.<br/>Příběh za obočím Monalisy<br/>Mona Lisa, když ji Da Vinci namaloval, skutečně měla obočí, ale postupem času a nadměrným čištěním je erodovaly do té míry, že už nejsou viditelné. Když vidíte obrázek, všimnete si, že obrázek nemá žádné řasy. V říjnu 2007 francouzský inženýr a vynálezce Pascal Cotte objevil s kamerou s vysokým rozlišením, že Leonardo da Vinci původně maloval obočí a řasy.<br/>Každopádně, děkuji moc za přečtení.

| In this three part series, The Art of Dress will explore the influence of one of the world’s most beautiful birds, the peacock, and one of its “Golden” ages of influence on fashion from 1894-1920.<br/>The brilliantly colored body and iridescent feathered train of the peacock—the male of the peafowl pavo species—has ensured its status as one of the world’s most beautiful birds. Immortalized in religion, myth, and folklore, peacocks from both species of the peafowl—the blue-bodied Indian and green-bodied Burmese—have proven to be sources of design inspiration in cultures the world over.<br/>Appreciated for centuries in the West for its beauty, but also as a symbol of exotic luxury, the male peacock has long been a recurring motif in women’s fashionable dress. This series will celebrate the peacock in women’s fashion, jewelry, and costume during a period when it infiltrated all areas of artistic expression. This period straddling the dawn of the new century provided a ripe climate for exploring not only the aesthetic appeal of the sinuous and beautiful creature, but also the fascinating worlds from which it came.<br/>The series will trace the peacock’s transition from a fashionable dress and accessory motif embraced by the Symbolist, Arts and Crafts, and Art Nouveau movements to its personification in the costumes of the greatest stars of the stage and screen during the 1910s.<br/>Part One: Fashioning the Peacock<br/>The peacock motif flourished in design during the end of the nineteenth-century, a time of heightened artistic expression in both Europe and America. After 1858, when Japan opened its doors to trade after years of isolation, images of the green peacock, depicted on various goods, came pouring into Europe. Responding to a lack of creativity in a growingly industrialized world, artists looked to sources, old and new, for inspiration. They embraced the green peacock found in Japanese imports but also the blue-bodied Indian peacock, and its white-bodied subspecies, as some one of their favorite subjects.<br/>During this period, women were often depicted alongside the colorful peacock or bejeweled in its iridescent feathers. In the image at left, the Symbolist painter Edgar Maxine employed the peacock in both a literal and a figurative sense. By depicting the peacock feather as a fashionable accessory, he is also alluding to the bird’s symbolic associations with pride and vanity. As the displaying peacock in the background demonstrates, the bird struts and shows off in an effort to find a mate. “Peacocking” was used to describe men, and occasionally women, who were observed to do the same.<br/>The peacock provided adornment to feminine beauty that naturally translated into dress. Couturiers used the peacock motif in some of their most spectacular designs. Jewelers of the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements immortalized the peacock in a variety of metals and precious stones and “peacock blue” became a fashionable color in dress and interiors. As the Buffalo Tribune noted in 1905: “Hats, gowns, cloaks, jewelry, household decorations, are all being affected by the peacock fad.” The same article recognized that “when the peacock comes into fashion it gets into every phase of it.”<br/>Below are featured six exquisite examples of the use of the peacock motif in fashion during this period.<br/>The peacock inspired haute couture in the tea gown by the House of Worth featured here. Although tea gowns were worn for informal entertaining in the privacy of a lady’s home, they were no less luxurious than their evening gown couterparts. In this gown, the pattern of peacock feathers emphasizes the sheen of the lustrous silk satin.<br/>A signifier of royalty in India, the peacock feather proved a fitting motif for this elaborately embroidered dress worn in 1903 by Lady Curzon, the American-born wife of the British Viceroy to India. The dress was worn to the State Ball of Delhi Durbar at which King Edward VII was proclaimed Emperor of India. It was designed and made by the House of Worth but embroidered by skilled craftsmen in India. Iridescent beetle wings were used to dot the “eyes” of the silver and gold peacock feather motifs.<br/>The green peafowl, or pavo muticus, is embroidered on this kimono by a leading Japanese export company. Originally from Burma (today’s Myanmar) in Central Asia, the green peacock found its way to Japan in the seventeenth century and became embedded in the country’s artistic traditions. In Japan, the peacock is a symbol of dignity and beauty; it is represented here alongside cherry blossoms, the eternal symbol for spring. In Europe and America, the Japanese kimono was especially fashionable as an informal at-home garment like the tea gown or dressing gown.<br/>“I want to be a living work of art,” the eccentric Italian aristocrat the Marquise Luisa Casati, is portrayed in a flurry of broad brush strokes and peacock feathers. The Marquise often employed the peacock as an accessory to her avant-garde fashions as well as to the dramatic costumes she wore to her many famous masquerade balls. At one ball, she wore a diadem of peacock feathers dripping with fresh chicken blood. At another, she appeared as a golden goddess leading a peacock on a leash.<br/>The Paris-based American designer Weeks makes the peacock itself—and not just its feathers—the center of attention on this dress. Embroidered on the bodice and screen-printed on the skirt, the peacock motif is highlighted against the streamlined silhouette of 1910. The peacock lent itself well to a new era in women’s fashion that embraced Asian influences.<br/>The London store, Liberty & Company opened its doors in 1875 at a time of heightened Japonism in Europe, and at first was solely dedicated to selling Asian wares. The company eventually expanded to selling fabrics and fashions of its own design. Both the coat and cape employ Liberty’s “Hera” pattern. The peacock was an intimate friend of the Greek goddess, who placed the many eyes of her faithful servant Argus on its tail. “Hera” was one of Liberty’s most successful fabrics and is still associated with the company today.<br/>Look for Part II next week!<br/>2 thoughts on “Revisiting the Art of the Peacock: A Golden Age, Fashion & Fantasy, 1894-1920, Part One”<br/>Beautifully written and very inspiring. Thank you for sharing all these delightful insights to the fashion world!<br/>Thank you, Pennie! I am so glad you are enjoying the site! | V této třídílné sérii The Art of Dress se podíváme na vliv jednoho z nejkrásnějších ptáků na světě, páva, a jednoho z jeho "zlatých" věků vlivu na módu z let 1894-1920.<br/>Brilantně zbarvené tělo a duhový opeřený vláček pávíka – samce pavího druhu – mu zajistily postavení jednoho z nejkrásnějších ptáků na světě. Pávi, kteří jsou nesmrtelní v náboženství, mýtech a folklóru, pocházejí z obou druhů peafowlů – modrých indických a zelených barmských – a prokázali, že jsou zdrojem inspirace pro design v kulturách po celém světě.<br/>Po staletí oceňovaný na Západě pro svou krásu, ale také jako symbol exotického luxusu, mužský páv je již dlouho opakujícím se motivem v dámských módních šatech. Tato série bude oslavovat páv v dámské módě, šperky a kostýmy v období, kdy infiltroval všechny oblasti uměleckého vyjádření. Toto období na úsvitu nového století poskytlo zralé klima pro zkoumání nejen estetické přitažlivosti svízelného a krásného tvora, ale také fascinujících světů, ze kterých pochází.<br/>Seriál bude sledovat přechod pávíka od módního motivu šatů a doplňků, který přijal symbolista, umění a řemesla a secesní hnutí, až po jeho ztělesnění v kostýmech největších hvězd jeviště a plátna během 1910s.<br/>Originální název: Fashioning the Peacock<br/>Pávový motiv vzkvétal v designu na konci devatenáctého století, v době zvýšeného uměleckého projevu v Evropě i Americe. Po roce 1858, kdy Japonsko otevřelo své dveře k obchodu po letech izolace, se do Evropy vlévaly obrazy zeleného páv, vyobrazené na různých zbožích. V reakci na nedostatek kreativity v rostoucím průmyslovém světě se umělci dívali na zdroje, staré i nové, pro inspiraci. Přijali zelený páv nalezený v japonských dovozech, ale také modrý indický páv a jeho bílý poddruh jako některé z jejich oblíbených témat.<br/>Během tohoto období byly ženy často zobrazovány vedle barevného pávu nebo byly ozdobeny v duhovém peří. Symbolistický malíř Edgar Maxine použil páv v doslovném i obrazném smyslu. Tím, že zobrazuje páví pírko jako módní doplněk, také s hrdostí a ješitností poukazuje na symbolické asociace ptáka. Jak ukazuje zobrazený páv v pozadí, pták se vzpíná a předvádí ve snaze najít partnera. "Peacocking" byl používán k popisu mužů a příležitostně i žen, u kterých bylo pozorováno, že dělají totéž.<br/>Páv zdobil ženskou krásu, která se přirozeně překládala do šatů. Couturiers používali motiv páva v některých z jejich nejpozoruhodnějších vzorů. Klenotníci secese a hnutí umění a řemesel zvěčnili páv v různých kovech a drahých kamenech a "páví modrá" se stala módní barvou v šatech a interiérech. Jak poznamenal Buffalo Tribune v roce 1905: "Klobouky, šaty, pláště, šperky, dekorace pro domácnost, všechny jsou ovlivněny pávovým výstřelkem." Stejný článek uznal, že "když páv přijde do módy, dostane se do každé fáze."<br/>Níže je uvedeno šest vynikajících příkladů použití pavího motivu v módě během tohoto období.<br/>Páv inspiroval haute couture v čajových šatech House of Worth. Ačkoli čajové šaty byly nošeny pro neformální zábavu v soukromí dámského domova, nebyly o nic méně luxusní než jejich večerní šaty couterparts. V této šaty, vzor pavího peří zdůrazňuje lesk lesklý hedvábný satén.<br/>Pávové peří se ukázalo jako vhodný motiv pro tento komplikovaně vyšívaný oděv, který nosila v roce 1903 lady Curzonová, americká manželka britského místokrále do Indie. Šaty byly nošeny na státní ples v Dillí Durbar, na kterém král Edward VII byl prohlášen císařem Indie. To bylo navrženo a vyrobeno House of Worth, ale vyšívané kvalifikovanými řemeslníky v Indii. Iridescentní broučí křídla byla použita k tečce "oči" stříbrných a zlatých motivů pávího peří.<br/>Zelený peafowl, neboli pavo muticus, je na tomto kimonu vyšíván přední japonskou exportní společností. Původně z Barmy (dnešní Myanmar) ve střední Asii, zelený páv našel svou cestu do Japonska v sedmnáctém století a stal se zakotvený v uměleckých tradicích země. V Japonsku je páv symbolem důstojnosti a krásy; je zde zastoupen vedle třešňových květů, věčného symbolu jara. V Evropě a Americe bylo japonské kimono obzvláště módní jako neformální domácí oděv, jako jsou čajové nebo županové šaty.<br/>"Chci být živým uměleckým dílem," líčí excentrickou italskou aristokratku markýzu Luisu Casatiovou v záplavě širokých tahů štětcem a pavím peřím. Markýza často používala páv jako doplněk k její avantgardní módě, stejně jako k dramatickým kostýmům, které nosila na svých mnoha slavných maškarních plesech. Na jednom plese nosila diadém pavích peří, které kapalo čerstvou kuřecí krví. V další se objevila jako zlatá bohyně vedoucí páv na vodítku.<br/>Americký návrhář Weeks sídlící v Paříži dělá páv sám - a nejen jeho peří - středem pozornosti na těchto šatech. Vyšívaný na živůtku a sítotisk na sukni, motiv pávů je zvýrazněn proti aerodynamické siluetě z roku 1910. Páv se dobře propůjčil nové éře v ženské módě, která přijala asijské vlivy.<br/>Londýnský obchod Liberty & Company otevřel své dveře v roce 1875 v době zvýšeného japonismu v Evropě a zpočátku se věnoval výhradně prodeji asijského zboží. Společnost se nakonec rozšířila o prodej tkanin a módy vlastního designu. Páv byl důvěrným přítelem řecké bohyně, která na ocas umístila mnoho očí svého věrného sluhy Arguse. "Hera" byla jednou z nejúspěšnějších látek společnosti Liberty a je dodnes spojena se společností.<br/>Podívejte se na druhou část příští týden!<br/>Revisiting the Art of the Peacock: A Golden Age, Fashion & Fantasy, 1894-1920, část první.<br/>Krásně napsané a velmi inspirující.

| The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized this Friday the emergency use of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years old.<br/>The FDA has released its decision three days after a scientific committee of that body recommended the use of the doses in minors in that population group. The agency indicated on its website that it based its authorization on the effectiveness of this vaccine, which is 90.7% to prevent COVID-19 among children of the aforementioned age group and also cited a study that indicates that “no serious side effects have been reported. “RELATED<br/>With a result of 17 votes in favor and one abstention, the committee had to vote on Tuesday “yes” or “no” to the question of whether the benefits of administering the two doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks. in minors between 5 and 11 years old. The vote was preceded by a debate about the safety of vaccines in minors, since in some cases they have been related to a heart condition called myocarditis, which involves inflammation of the heart.<br/>Expert Hong Yang, Risk-Benefit Assessment Advisor for the FDA Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, spoke of several possible scenarios regarding the evolution of the pandemic and in all of these cases she considered that the benefits of immunizing children outweigh ” clearly “the risks. Yang acknowledged that there is a theoretical risk of myocarditis, which is more present in those vaccinated, especially in young men, although for her it is possible that the benefits of immunization continue to be “strong”.<br/>A pediatrician from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, in English), Matthew Oster, presented during the session on Tuesday the data of a study of children between 12 and 17 years old, and highlighted that they have not detected higher rates of myocarditis caused by vaccines in that group. In May, the US gave the green light to the Pfizer injection for teens 12 and older.<br/>Oster explained that myocarditis can occur in minors with multisystem inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19. According to the CDC, although it is unknown what exactly causes this syndrome in which various parts of the body become inflamed, it is known that in many cases it occurs in children who had covid or who were close to a positive for the disease.<br/>For its analysis, the CDC followed the cases of 5,000 children with that syndrome related to the covid and, according to Oster, the agency “has not yet seen any signal” that connects it to vaccines. Specifically, the CDC identified 24 volunteers who had been immunized before contracting the syndrome, of which 18 had been infected with covid. “We have not seen high rates of MIS-C (as that myocarditis is known) associated with vaccines in infants and older children,” Oster said. | Americký Úřad pro kontrolu potravin a léčiv (FDA) schválil tento pátek nouzové použití vakcíny Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 pro děti ve věku od 5 do 11 let.<br/>FDA vydala své rozhodnutí tři dny poté, co vědecký výbor tohoto orgánu doporučil použití dávek u nezletilých v této populační skupině. Agentura na svých webových stránkách uvedla, že zakládá své povolení na účinnosti této vakcíny, což je 90,7%, aby se zabránilo COVID-19 u dětí výše uvedené věkové skupiny, a také citovala studii, která naznačuje, že "nebyly hlášeny žádné závažné vedlejší účinky. "SOUVISEJÍCÍ<br/>S výsledkem 17 hlasů pro a jeden se zdržel hlasování, výbor musel v úterý hlasovat "ano" nebo "ne" na otázku, zda přínosy podání dvou dávek vakcíny Pfizer / BioNTech převyšují rizika. u nezletilých ve věku od 5 do 11 let. Hlasování předcházela debata o bezpečnosti vakcín u nezletilých, protože v některých případech byly spojeny se srdečním onemocněním nazývaným myokarditida, která zahrnuje zánět srdce.<br/>Expertka Hong Yangová, poradkyně pro hodnocení rizik pro Úřad pro biostatistiku a epidemiologii FDA, hovořila o několika možných scénářích týkajících se vývoje pandemie a ve všech těchto případech se domnívala, že přínos očkování dětí jasně převažuje nad riziky. Yang uznal, že existuje teoretické riziko myokarditidy, která je více přítomna u očkovaných, zejména u mladých mužů, i když pro ni je možné, že přínosy imunizace budou i nadále "silné".<br/>Pediatr z Centra pro kontrolu a prevenci nemocí (CDC, anglicky), Matthew Oster, představil během zasedání v úterý údaje ze studie u dětí ve věku od 12 do 17 let a zdůraznil, že v této skupině nebyly zjištěny vyšší míry myokarditidy způsobené vakcínami. V květnu daly USA zelenou injekci Pfizeru pro dospívající starší 12 let.<br/>Oster vysvětlil, že myokarditida se může objevit u nezletilých s multisystémovým zánětlivým syndromem způsobeným COVID-19. Podle CDC, i když není známo, co přesně způsobuje tento syndrom, ve kterém se různé části těla zanítí, je známo, že se v mnoha případech vyskytuje u dětí, které měly covid nebo které byly blízko pozitivní na onemocnění.<br/>Pro svou analýzu CDC sledovala případy 5 000 dětí s tímto syndromem souvisejícím s covidem a podle Ostera agentura "dosud neviděla žádný signál", který by jej spojoval s vakcínami. Konkrétně CDC identifikovala 24 dobrovolníků, kteří byli imunizováni před nakažením syndromem, z nichž 18 bylo infikováno covidem. "Neviděli jsme vysokou míru MIS-C (jak je známo, že myokarditida) spojené s vakcínami u kojenců a starších dětí," řekl Oster. |
