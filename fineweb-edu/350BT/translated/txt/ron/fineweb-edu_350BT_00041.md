| The workplace can be a complex environment, with numerous laws and regulations that govern the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers. In Canada, the legal framework that governs employment relationships is known as status law. Status law covers a wide range of issues, from hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety. Understanding these laws is critical for employees, who can use this information to protect their rights and advocate for themselves in the workplace. This guide will provide a brief overview of some of the most common law cases in Canada.<br/>Hiring and Termination:<br/>One of the most important aspects of status law is the hiring process. Employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws and ensure that they do not make hiring decisions based on factors such as race, gender, age, or religion. Once an employee has been hired, the employer is also required to follow specific procedures if they decide to terminate the employee. By Law includes providing the employee with adequate notice, or paying them severance if the termination is without cause. best employment lawyer Toronto can advise about it.<br/>Discrimination and Harassment:<br/>Another critical aspect of status law is protecting employees from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfairly based on a personal characteristic, such as race, gender, age, or religion. Harassment is any behavior that creates a hostile or offensive working environment. In both cases, employees have the right to file a complaint with their employer or with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.<br/>Wages and Hours of Work:<br/>Status law also regulates the wages and hours of work for employees. Employers must comply with minimum wage laws and ensure that employees receive the appropriate overtime pay for any hours worked over the standard workweek. In addition, employers must provide employees with breaks and time off for holidays, vacations, and sick leave.<br/>Finally, status law requires employers to maintain a safe working environment for their employees. This includes providing adequate training, equipment, and safety protocols to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. Employees have the right to refuse work if they believe it is unsafe, and employers must investigate and address any safety concerns raised by employees and represented by the best employment lawyer in Toronto.<br/>In conclusion, understanding the common cases in Canadian status law is essential for employees to navigate the workplace and protect their rights. From hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety, employees need to be aware of the laws that govern their employment relationship. If employees have any questions or concerns, they can seek advice from a lawyer or consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. By knowing their rights and responsibilities, employees can ensure a fair and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues. | Locul de muncă poate fi un mediu complex, cu numeroase legi și reglementări care reglementează drepturile și responsabilitățile angajaților și angajatorilor. În Canada, cadrul juridic care guvernează relațiile de muncă este cunoscut sub numele de legea statutului. Legea privind statutul acoperă o gamă largă de probleme, de la angajare și încetare a activității până la discriminare și siguranța la locul de muncă. Înțelegerea acestor legi este esențială pentru angajați, care pot utiliza aceste informații pentru a-și proteja drepturile și pentru a se apăra la locul de muncă. Acest ghid va oferi o scurtă prezentare generală a unora dintre cele mai comune cazuri de drept din Canada.<br/>Angajarea și reziliere:<br/>Unul dintre cele mai importante aspecte ale legii statutului este procesul de angajare. Angajatorii trebuie să respecte legile anti-discriminare și să se asigure că nu iau decizii de angajare bazate pe factori cum ar fi rasa, sexul, vârsta sau religia. Odată ce un angajat a fost angajat, angajatorul este, de asemenea, obligat să urmeze proceduri specifice în cazul în care decid să concedieze angajatul. Prin lege, include furnizarea angajatului cu o notificare adecvată sau plata concedierii în cazul în care încetarea este fără motiv. cel mai bun avocat de ocupare a forței de muncă Toronto poate sfătui cu privire la aceasta.<br/>Discriminare și hărțuire:<br/>Un alt aspect critic al legii statutului este protejarea angajaților de discriminare și hărțuire la locul de muncă. Discriminarea apare atunci când un angajat este tratat incorect pe baza unei caracteristici personale, cum ar fi rasa, sexul, vârsta sau religia. Hărțuirea este orice comportament care creează un mediu de lucru ostil sau ofensator. În ambele cazuri, angajații au dreptul de a depune o plângere la angajatorul lor sau la Comisia Canadiană pentru Drepturile Omului.<br/>Salariile și orele de lucru:<br/>Legea privind statutul reglementează, de asemenea, salariile și orele de lucru pentru angajați. Angajatorii trebuie să respecte legile privind salariul minim și să se asigure că angajații primesc plata adecvată pentru orele suplimentare pentru orice ore lucrate pe parcursul săptămânii de lucru standard. În plus, angajatorii trebuie să ofere angajaților pauze și timp liber pentru vacanțe, concedii și concedii medicale.<br/>În cele din urmă, legea statutului cere angajatorilor să mențină un mediu de lucru sigur pentru angajații lor. Aceasta include furnizarea de formare adecvată, echipamente și protocoale de siguranță pentru a preveni accidentele și rănirile la locul de muncă. Angajații au dreptul de a refuza munca dacă consideră că este nesigur, iar angajatorii trebuie să investigheze și să abordeze orice probleme de siguranță ridicate de angajați și reprezentate de cel mai bun avocat de ocupare a forței de muncă din Toronto.<br/>În concluzie, înțelegerea cazurilor comune din legislația canadiană privind statutul este esențială pentru ca angajații să navigheze la locul de muncă și să-și protejeze drepturile. De la angajare și concediere la discriminare și siguranța la locul de muncă, angajații trebuie să fie conștienți de legile care reglementează relația lor de muncă. În cazul în care angajații au întrebări sau preocupări, aceștia pot solicita sfatul unui avocat sau pot consulta Comisia Canadiană pentru Drepturile Omului. Prin cunoașterea drepturilor și responsabilităților lor, angajații pot asigura un mediu de lucru echitabil și sigur pentru ei înșiși și pentru colegii lor. |
| There's an old adage in the auto industry that says your vehicle loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot. The computer and technology industry is not so different, in that new parts and systems are constantly pushing the envelope of performance and value, making it impossible to have a top-of-the-line system for very long. The purpose of this paper is to step back in time 10 years and examine the technology landscape then to see how it compares to today's technologies we know and love.<br/>Much has been written, and much is still debated about the technology axiom called; Moore's Law. Some people interpret the law to mean a doubling of computer power every 18 months to 2 years, while others maintain it means a doubling of the numbers of transistors (microscopic on / off switches if you will) engineers are able to print into the same amount of silicon. In fact Moore stated that transistor counts would double every year, which he later adjusted to be every 2 years) Regardless, this trend of performance and transistor growth has held true for over 40 years.<br/>More recently, Moore's law has been applied to graphics processing units (GPUs) as well. The GPU is actually not even 10 years old at the time of writing. The official term GPU was coined with the nVidia GeForce 256 series of 3D cards. Released in August 1999, this was the first chip that was able to compute vertex transformations and pixel lighting in hardware. Since its release, graphics processing power has followed a similar trend of doubling performance every 18 months to 2 years. This article is not a technical document, rather a glimpse into the past 10 years ago to give you an idea of how far we've come in such a short time.<br/>A Little History About the Author:<br/>The year was 1999. It was my sophomore / junior year in high school. Now I'll pause so that 90% of the readers who grow up in the 70s and 80's can turn up their nose and stop reading.<br/>Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's continue.<br/>I am an internet child. I got into computers, and all manner of electronic geekery just as the Internet was becoming something that "just might catch on". My high school was not quite on the boring edge of technology as it was, but we were one of the first public schools in my area to be equipped with a full T1 line and the 1.5Mbps of awesome dedicated bandwidth that it piped through the network . Our network was built from a hodge-podge mixture of nice PC computers labs (mostly K6 200MHz / Win 95 machines), and a network engineers nightmare concoction of Macintoshes; LC II's up through new G3 iMacs.<br/>In 1999 I was still rocking a 486 DX-33 PC with 8MB of ram and Windows 3.11 as my PC at home, while my parents had a nice Pentium 100 Windows 95 machine my siblings and I would fight for time on. So what was the point of those last couple paragraphs you're probably asking? Well, that is where I was, and what I was using 10 years ago in computing, and hopefully it got you thinking back a decade to what you were computing on.<br/>10 years ago today, The computer world was working itself into a frenzy, getting ready for the near future release of the brand new Intel Pentium III Processor. The best money could do was a Pentium II processor at 450MHz with PC100 Memory. Rival AMD was doing alright for itself peddling its budget conscious K6-2 series of processors. Your average computer cost around $ 2000- $ 2500 at this time for a PC with a solid Pentium II processor. The Pentium III was due to be released on February 26th, and was the subject of a wicked debate over the merits of its built in unique ID number. Also noteworthy was its inclusion of the first SSE instruction set (The modern Core i7 processor is at SSE4 +). However without software designed to make use of the new instructions the processor was not much faster than an equivalent clocked Pentium II CPU and took quite a bit of heat from the press.<br/>On the graphics front the war between nVidia and 3DFx was raging. nVidia, a relative newcomer to the field, was riding high on top of their very successful TNT (Twin-Texel) video processor, while 3DFx was fighting to retain its market leadership title with its Voodoo3 line of graphics cards. The Voodoo cards were excellent performers, however the TNT cards had the advantage of 32 bit color while the Voodoo's were stuck at 24 bits. ATI was around and kicking with their Rage series of 3D cards (especially popular as integrated chips in servers and workstations), however they never really entered into the hardcore 3D accelerator race until the Radeon line debuted in 2000.<br/>In 1999 the internet boom was just beginning and attracting massive amounts of attention and investment capital from all over the globe. The big business of the time was in the search and portal business. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and Lycos were perhaps the most recognizable and capable players in this industry. Google -say-wha? Other companies from other industries, such as television media, and ISPs were taking notice, and buying up internet portals right and left in an attempt to tap into the viral spread of the internet. New technologies like Java were coming into their own, and began to lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. Studies determined that by 1999 about half of US households had a computer, and most of the new computer purchases were being made to get online.<br/>PDA's were quickly becoming the new must have gadget. The Palm Pilot being the device that led the charge. I myself had a Palm IIIe toward the later half of 2000. Personal pagers were still hot sellers, but cell phones were getting smaller and more practical and affordable. Also a war was heating up in the computer memory segment. Samsung introduced new DDR memory chips that promised to double the effective bandwidth of existing memory chips in future setups, however Rambus was busy developing their own high speed RAM for use in high end Intel systems.<br/>This field is possibly a bit too large to cover here, but a brief OS recap: The PC world was running strong with windows 98, and anxiously awaiting the updated Windows 98 Second Edition due out in May 1999. The Macintosh crowd was plugging away happily on their Mac OS 8.5 Machines, while awaiting an update to OS 9 sometime later that year. Linux was also starting to come into its own, as big name vendors like IBM were starting to bundle distributions of Redhat, Caldera, and others with some servers.<br/>I'll admit this article was more for my amusement and reminiscing than anything else. I hope that somewhere in the course of this mass of words and broken sentences, you too had some good recollections of computer equipment past. It's good to remember the technologies we grow up with and we are fortunately enough to have the robust internet we are used to today to help conjure up images and technical specs of those glory days. Sites like the Tech Time Machine exist to help us relive those days, and have a few chuckles at equipment we thought we'd never use to its full potential. I remember touching a Pentium 200MMX machine for the first time and being in awe at its raw speed and seemingly infinite possibilities. Now I constantly get upset with the speed of my current 3GHz dual core Athlon X2 6000+ PC. I can not even imagine how many windows that Pentium 200 would have thrown out of today. It's a crazy world we live in. | Există o veche zicală în industria auto care spune că vehiculul dvs. pierde valoare de îndată ce îl conduceți din lot. Industria computerelor și a tehnologiei nu este atât de diferită, deoarece piesele și sistemele noi împing în mod constant în jurul valorii de performanță și valoare, ceea ce face imposibilă existența unui sistem de vârf pentru o perioadă foarte lungă de timp. Scopul acestei lucrări este de a face un pas înapoi în timp cu 10 ani și de a examina peisajul tehnologic, apoi pentru a vedea cum se compară cu tehnologiile de astăzi pe care le cunoaștem și le iubim.<br/>Multe s-au scris, și multe sunt încă dezbătute despre axioma tehnologiei numită; Legea lui Moore. Unii oameni interpretează legea ca însemnând o dublare a puterii computerului la fiecare 18 luni până la 2 ani, în timp ce alții susțin că înseamnă o dublare a numărului de tranzistori (switch-uri microscopice pornite / oprite, dacă doriți) inginerii sunt capabili să imprime în aceeași cantitate de siliciu. De fapt, Moore a declarat că numărătoarea tranzistorilor se dublează în fiecare an, ceea ce el a ajustat mai târziu pentru a fi la fiecare 2 ani) Indiferent, această tendință de creștere a performanței și a tranzistorilor a fost valabilă de peste 40 de ani.<br/>Mai recent, legea lui Moore a fost aplicată și unităților de procesare grafică (GPU). GPU-ul nu are nici măcar 10 ani la momentul scrierii. Termenul oficial GPU a fost inventat cu seria de plăci 3D nVidia GeForce 256. Lansat în august 1999, acesta a fost primul cip care a fost capabil să calculeze transformările de vârf și iluminarea pixelilor în hardware. De la lansarea sa, puterea de procesare grafică a urmat o tendință similară de dublare a performanței la fiecare 18 luni la 2 ani. Acest articol nu este un document tehnic, ci mai degrabă o privire în ultimii 10 ani pentru a vă oferi o idee despre cât de departe am ajuns într-un timp atât de scurt.<br/>Un pic de istorie despre autor:<br/>Anul a fost 1999. A fost anul secundar / junior în liceu. Acum voi face o pauză astfel încât 90% dintre cititorii care cresc în anii 70 și 80 să-și poată întoarce nasul și să nu mai citească.<br/>Bine, acum că asta nu mai e în cale, să continuăm.<br/>Sunt un copil al internetului. Am intrat în computere, și tot felul de geekuri electronice la fel cum internetul a devenit ceva ce "ar putea prinde". Liceul meu nu era chiar pe marginea plictisitoare a tehnologiei așa cum era, dar am fost una dintre primele școli publice din zona mea care a fost echipată cu o linie completă T1 și 1.5Mbps de lățime de bandă dedicată minunată pe care a canalizat-o prin rețea. Rețeaua noastră a fost construită dintr-un amestec de hodge-podge de laboratoare de calculatoare PC frumos (mai ales K6 200MHz / Win 95 mașini), și un ingineri de rețea coșmar amestec de Macintoshes; LC II este în sus prin noi G3 iMacs.<br/>În 1999 încă mai jucam cu un PC 486 DX-33 cu 8MB de ram și Windows 3.11 ca PC-ul meu acasă, în timp ce părinții mei aveau o mașină frumoasă Pentium 100 cu Windows 95 pe care frații mei și eu am luptat pentru timp. Deci, care a fost scopul ultimelor două paragrafe pe care probabil le întrebați? Ei bine, acolo am fost, și ceea ce am folosit acum 10 ani în calcul, și sper că te-a făcut să te gândești la un deceniu la ceea ce calculai.<br/>Acum 10 ani, Lumea calculatoarelor lucra într-o frenezie, pregătindu-se pentru lansarea în viitorul apropiat a noului procesor Intel Pentium III. Cel mai bun bani ar putea face a fost un procesor Pentium II la 450MHz cu memorie PC100. Rival AMD se descurca bine pentru el însuși distribuind seria sa de procesoare K6-2 conștiente de buget. Calculatorul dvs. mediu costă în jur de $ 2000- $ 2500 în acest moment pentru un PC cu un procesor solid Pentium II. Pentium III urma să fie lansat pe 26 februarie și a fost subiectul unei dezbateri diabolice privind meritele numărului său unic de identificare construit. De asemenea, a fost de remarcat includerea primului set de instrucțiuni SSE (Procesorul modern Core i7 este la SSE4 +). Cu toate acestea, fără software conceput pentru a utiliza noile instrucțiuni, procesorul nu a fost mult mai rapid decât un procesor Pentium II echivalent și a luat destul de multă căldură de la presă.<br/>Pe frontul grafic războiul dintre nVidia și 3DFx a fost furios. nVidia, un nou venit relativ pe teren, se afla pe partea de sus a procesorului video TNT (Twin-Texel), în timp ce 3DFx se lupta să-și păstreze titlul de lider de piață cu linia sa de plăci grafice Voodoo3. Cardurile Voodoo au avut performanțe excelente, dar cardurile TNT au avut avantajul culorii pe 32 de biți, în timp ce cardurile Voodoo au fost blocate la 24 de biți. ATI a fost în jur și lovind cu seria lor Rage de carduri 3D (în special populare ca cipuri integrate în servere și stații de lucru), cu toate acestea, ei nu au intrat cu adevărat în cursa acceleratorului 3D hardcore până când linia Radeon a debutat în 2000.<br/>În 1999, boom-ul internetului abia începea și atragea cantități masive de atenție și capital de investiții din întreaga lume. Marea afacere a timpului a fost în afacerile de căutare și portal. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite și Lycos au fost probabil cei mai recunoscuți și capabili jucători din această industrie. Alte companii din alte industrii, cum ar fi mass-media de televiziune și furnizorii de servicii de internet, au luat notă și au cumpărat portaluri de internet din dreapta și din stânga, într-o încercare de a profita de răspândirea virală a internetului. Noile tehnologii, cum ar fi Java, au început să apară și să pună bazele internetului așa cum îl știm astăzi. Studiile au stabilit că până în 1999, aproximativ jumătate din gospodăriile din SUA aveau un computer, iar majoritatea achizițiilor de noi computere erau făcute pentru a obține online.<br/>PDA-urile au devenit rapid noul gadget care trebuie să aibă. Palm Pilot fiind dispozitivul care a condus încărcarea. Eu însumi am avut un Palm IIIe spre jumătatea ulterioară a anului 2000. Paginarele personale erau încă de vânzare, dar telefoanele mobile erau din ce în ce mai mici, mai practice și mai accesibile. De asemenea, un război se încălzea în segmentul memoriei computerului. Samsung a introdus noi cipuri de memorie DDR care au promis să dubleze lățimea de bandă efectivă a cipurilor de memorie existente în configurațiile viitoare, dar Rambus a fost ocupat cu dezvoltarea propriei RAM de mare viteză pentru utilizarea în sistemele Intel de înaltă calitate.<br/>Acest domeniu este, probabil, un pic prea mare pentru a acoperi aici, dar un scurt rezumat al sistemului de operare: Lumea PC-ului rulează puternic cu Windows 98 și așteaptă cu nerăbdare actualizarea Windows 98 Second Edition, care urmează să fie lansată în mai 1999. Mulțimea Macintosh s-a conectat fericită la Mac OS 8.5, în timp ce aștepta o actualizare la OS 9 mai târziu în acel an. Linux a început, de asemenea, să vină în propriile sale, ca mari vânzători de nume, cum ar fi IBM au început să pachet distribuții de Redhat, Caldera, și altele cu unele servere.<br/>Recunosc că acest articol a fost mai mult pentru distracția și amintirea mea decât orice altceva. Sper că undeva în cursul acestei mase de cuvinte și fraze rupte, și tu ai avut unele amintiri bune de echipamente de calculator trecut. Este bine să ne amintim tehnologiile cu care am crescut și suntem destul de norocoși să avem internetul robust cu care suntem obișnuiți astăzi pentru a ajuta la evocarea imaginilor și a specificațiilor tehnice ale acelor zile de glorie. Site-uri precum Mașina Timpului Tech există pentru a ne ajuta să retrăim acele zile, și să avem câteva râsete la echipamente pe care am crezut că nu le vom folosi niciodată la întregul potențial. Îmi amintesc că am atins pentru prima dată o mașină Pentium 200MMX și am fost uimit de viteza sa brută și de posibilitățile aparent infinite. Acum mă supăr în mod constant cu viteza actualului meu PC Athlon X2 6000+ dual core de 3GHz. Nici nu-mi pot imagina câte ferestre ar fi aruncat astăzi Pentium 200. Este o lume nebună în care trăim. |
| The cultural anthropology major and minor offer a holistic understanding of human diversity. By exploring, analyzing, and understanding patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors, shared histories, language, visual representations and material realities, cultural anthropology focuses on what it means to be human. Our courses address relevant concerns such as food and nutrition; urban, rural, and global adaptive strategies; environmental sustainability; and economic development. Through its comparative and engaged field research methods, cultural anthropology recognizes culture as the primary means by which humans engage in social and environmental interactions to define meaningful and purposeful lives. Cultural anthropology complements well all other undergraduate majors.<br/>Top 3 Skills Learned<br/>- Critical thinking<br/>- Qualitative research methods<br/>- Partnership & collaboration with community<br/>Usually this happens toward the end of the Introduction to Anthropology course, when you realize that anthropology opens doors to new ways of looking at relevant problems in our world. It give you a big picture approach that liberates you from assumptions that there only a few answers to life's enduring questions. Ethnographic research helps you recognize your own humanity as a common condition and grow your hearts to care more deeply for others.

| Fact or Myth: Sodium Raises Blood Pressure<br/>Well, Matt, it turns out a high sodium diet might not raise blood pressure, nor have any sort of adverse effect on cardiovascular health at all. But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence (and there is more evidence that says it doesn’t than does).<br/>The debate over eating too much salt has been around since the 1960s. Almost every major governmental health organization embraces the idea that eating too much salt is damaging to your health. Most major news outlets report on these recommendations and people tend to try and follow them. This is most likely why most of us, especially the elderly with heart problems, know to reduce the amount of salt we eat. Those of us who like the idea that any recommendation be backed up by solid evidence, have to step back on this one. As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.<br/>So why have most health organizations pushed the idea of low sodium diets? The theory behind their supposition is sound, and there are some studies that show a minor risk of elevated blood pressure with extremely high salt intake. Unfortunately, there are many other studies that show no increase, and still some that show reducing salt intake might actually raise your blood pressure! Let’s look at the controversy in more detail.<br/>The idea salt will increase your blood pressure has to do with osmotic pressure. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell walls), from areas of lower solute concentration (in this case salt) to areas of higher solute concentration. This naturally equalizes the solute concentration on both sides of the membrane. (This osmotic pressure is also why salt can be used to preserves meat.)<br/>So the theory goes that when we eat too much salt, our bloodstream has more sodium in it than the surrounding areas of our body. This causes the water in those areas to be pulled into our bloodstream. The increase in water within the arteries and veins causes an increase in the pressure within those arteries and veins. The salt itself also acts like an irritant within the arteries causing them to constrict. This too is thought to increase your blood pressure.<br/>The theory seems, on the surface, very sound. After all, we can make the process of salt pulling water through membranes happen time and time again in the lab. The question is, does this actually happen within our bodies, and does this actually cause long term hypertension (high blood pressure)?<br/>In 1969, Lewis Dahl testified before Sen. George McGovern’s “select committee on nutrition and human needs”. He was concerned about the high concentrations of sodium in baby foods and thought this might cause increase in people’s blood pressure long term. His reasoning was that studies done on rats showed increases in the blood pressure of the rats.<br/>The conversation about salt and hypertension began to circulate among health organizations. The National Institutes of Health, in 1972, began introducing “High Blood Pressure Education Programs”. As their evidence, they pointed out observationally, populations who ate very little sodium had low incidents of high blood pressure. They also pointed to the rat modeling. Scientists at the time questioned this, as the rat studies had them eating 60 times what the average person does. They also pointed out the populations who ate low sodium diets, also ate low amounts of other things, like sugar (which also affects osmosis).<br/>Despite their objections, publicly, the idea of high sodium diets causing high blood pressure was here to stay, and remains today. The Centers For Disease Control, The National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and many other organizations currently promote low sodium diets.<br/>Despite the seemingly unified front presented by these distinguished organizations, the controversy among scientists is extremely heated. In 1998, award winning author Taubes, published “The Political Science of Salt” in the Journal of Science. He stated, “The controversy over the benefits, if any, of salt reduction now constitutes one of the longest running most vitriolic and surreal disputes in all of medicine.”<br/>One surgeon general in a report wrote, the speed with which US federal agencies embraced sodium reduction, “stood in stark contrast to how long it had taken for recommendations to emerge on the importance of reducing blood cholesterol levels”. He also noted that the difference was even more remarkable considering the absence of published research that actually tested the theory. On the flip-side, Sir Micheal Rawlings, the chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, who promotes salt reduction diets argued that, “Guidance (in policy making) is based on the best available evidence. The evidence may not, however, be very good and is rarely complete.” Not a very strong argument for reducing salt intake.<br/>Let’s look at a few relatively recent studies. In 2008, Italian researchers began publishing the results from a series of clinical trials, all of which reported that, among patients with heart failure, reducing salt consumption increased the risk of death. These studies were followed by others which showed among Type 1 and 2 diabetics, healthy Europeans and patients with chronic heart failure, those that ate salt at the lower limit of the normal range were more likely to have heart disease than those who ate salt in the middle range of normal.<br/>In 2011, two Cochrane reviews found no evidence that low salt diets either improved or worsened peoples’ health. They stated, “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.”<br/>Even in the face of no clear scientific evidence to support it and some to the contrary, in 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Society of Hypertension all continued to promote low sodium diets as a means of controlling high blood pressure.<br/>In the end, being a medical professional and someone who needs clear evidence to make a decision about whether I get to add copious amounts of salt on my fries, I am pleased to find that so far there is very little! All the major health organizations seem to promote low sodium diets, but none have actually published consistent studies that show low sodium diets help in health, particularly not in cardiovascular health. What I find most annoying, a pet peeve of mine, is that none of these organizations tell people that the science behind their policies is controversial and they might be flat wrong. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns, and Sandro Galea said it best in their article “Salt And Public Health”- “After a careful consideration of the debate over salt, we have concluded that the concealment of scientific uncertainty is a mistake that serves neither the ends of science nor good policy.”<br/>So you should you go out and smother everything in salt now? As with most things, if science hasn’t been able to answer the question definitively one way or the other, and you want to be safe rather than sorry, just go with the age old rule of “moderation in everything”. If you, like me, like to salt everything like the rim of a margarita glass and moderation be damned, at least now you can feel a little better about it as science seems to be leaning more and more towards low sodium diets being unnecessary and high sodium ones not being harmful at all.<br/>If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below, you might also like:<br/>- Why Salt Enhances Flavor<br/>- What Do the Numbers in a Blood Pressure Test Mean and What Do They Tell the Doctor<br/>- What Causes Arms, Legs, and Feet to “Fall Asleep”<br/>- Top 5 First Aid Tricks Everyone Should Know<br/>- How to Remove a Fresh Carpet Stain with Nothing But Salt<br/>- High blood pressure is neither a disease nor an illness in and of itself. It’s merely a risk factor for other problems. For instance, if you have chronic high blood pressure, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke goes up significantly. This high pressure could be caused by excessive plaque on the inside of your artery walls, making those arteries in effect, smaller. Think plumbing. When the pipes that transport fluid get smaller, the pressure that same volume of fluid exerts goes up. What happens if your blood pressure gets too high? I’ll answer that question with another one. What happens if the water pressure in your houses pipes gets too high? Your pipes burst. Same thing here. Should your blood pressure get too high, your arteries have a greater chance of bursting. If there is too much gunk inside your pipes (plaque inside your arteries), that ball of gunk could get too big and clog off your pipes! Seems bad too me! Especially, if those arteries are in your brain, or heart. It’s not like kidneys, where you have two! You spring a leak in those organs, and your family finally gets that big paycheck from your life insurance policy! Not really the best way to get paid, well, unless you’re really a jerk and everyone in your family hates you! Then they might not mind so much, but you certainly would.<br/>- Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury. For reference, 1 psi (pounds per square inch) is equal to 51.7149326 millimeters of mercury. If you were bleeding and wanted to stop the blood-loss with direct pressure, and you should, you would only need to use about 3 psi to stop it. Unless they have really high blood pressure, then maybe 4 psi. Basic math saves the day again!<br/>- The first known experiment to measure the exact pressure of blood was performed by Stephen Hales on December 1, 1733. He took a live horse. Attached a tube to her left crural artery, then allowed her blood to rush through the tube and it rose to a height of 8’3”. He noted that “when it was at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each pulse 2, 3,or 4 inches”. Yes the horse bled out, but don’t think Mr. Hales was too cruel, he performed the experiment on a horse that was about to be put down anyway! To the horse, I’m sure this distinction didn’t matter much of course. 🙂<br/>*Legal Disclaimer: While I am a medical professional, this article contains general information about medical conditions and treatments.

Whenever I eat crisps (chips if you live in the USA) which have a fairly large amount of salt, my BP goes up significantly the next few days.<br/>I tried getting saltless crisps about a week ago and added my own “lo-salt” (a salt substitute consisting of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (salt), but twice as much as the former than the latter).<br/>Anyway the lo-salt flavoured crisps (chips) diodn’t raise my BP at all.<br/>OK I know that further experiments on myself is required. But at the moment I’m strongly suspecting salt as the culprit. I’m also suspect that sugar increases my BP too. But lots of investigation required to establish that!<br/>Maybe you have a poor potassium to sodium balance. My mum has hypertension and was on a low sodium diet but she was not getting enough potassium and her blood pressure was not stable. If you are concerned you may want to have your blood potassium level checked.<br/>Now that she is consuming enough potassium she her blood pressure has been normal for over a year while consuming sodium within normal ranges(more than 2500 mg)<br/>It’s not the sodium…. it’s the fat and starch that is making you fatter and fatter; and that, is you body mass increasing and making it harder for your heart to pump blood through the veins and arteries that get squished in your body by the increased amount of accumulated fat.<br/>you are eating pure bloody starch and pointing to salt instead of the sugar, anything to avoid incrimination of sugar not too mention vegetable oil that increases all causes of death. You get far more osmolality from the sugar<br/>Hard evidence needed? Not a myth and very easy to document — requires little intelligence or training, anyone can do it. At the age of 52-54, this was over a two year period (2005 and 2006). Used a software program (Diet Power 4 — I paid $50 for it but it is now free to download) to track food, sodium, and bicycle exercise time. Produced graphs using the pen and paper method although will do the same thing being the program had no provisions to enter data on blood pressure. A doctor taking a reading every three to six months is absolutely is of no value in my opinion if an effort is not made to take the reading under identical circumstances other than to show a general trend over several years.<br/>I found that to be of any value, for my graph type and hypothesis (now proven), it was necessary to take several readings over a period of at least five minutes or until two close (three or less numerical spread and no more than three bpm on heart rate) readings. I would take note of readings after a two mile walk or an hour of biking at a slow to moderate rate. Wide swings over five minutes quit after I got in physical shape and stayed on the diet. Professional sites recommend sitting down 3 minutes or more and taking more than one reading but I only had one or two doctors in the last twenty years doing that, some over the need to quickly see another patient. A nurse claimed the significant reason for taking blood pressure readings were the insurance companies insisting on it. She claimed some doctors did not look at the readings she took so who cares if an effort was made to get an accurate reading was her conclusion.<br/>Walk in after rushing to show up on time, climbing stairs or whatever, sit down, a nurse grabs your arm and takes your blood pressure. At one time I convinced a doctor to take a second reading after ten minutes of discussing with me my medical problems. He claimed he had seldom waited, a man with 15 years of experience although professional sites recommended waiting three minutes. Another doctor claimed he had never heard of Na effecting blood pressure (he had been an army doctor with different standards for education he claimed).<br/>Now to the results. The graphs were beautiful and showed a perfect coalition between the the five factors entered; food type, sodium amounts, exercise, heart rate, weight.<br/>I had been on blood pressure medicine for ten years with only a numerical change of 5. I also was in sedentary employment and received zero exercise. My weight was at the upper end of normal weight or slightly overweight. I would would eat typical amounts of sodium for Americans (2,000+ mg) over two days. Then various amounts of low sodium for 4 days then gradually increase over a period of several days. After 72+ hours of a low sodium diet and exercise program, my blood pressure would drop significantly. 135/90 to 110/70 over three days was typical after being on my diet plan (the DASH diet) for one month. Sugar levels and high chemical foods were also recorded as part of diet. Sodium intake showed up more than others exercise as the biggest variable. High chemical foods also showed a difference although high chemical foods often have high sodium levels.<br/>Over four day after resuming the DASH diet there would be a significant and gradual change to the upside. It takes two or more days, depending on physical activity and water consumption to dissipate the sodium in your blood is my hypothesis although I have never confirmed this from research.<br/>I suspect sodium levels for proper blood pressure varies between people and different body designs (gender, race, activity, fat vs skinny, exercise level, etc). Many people may have little if any effect from a 2,000 mg vs 600 mg of Na. I’m not one of those. It is estimated cavemen had a diet of 400 to 600mg Na. What was good enough for cavemen (who had short lives for other reasons) was good enough for me.<br/>I had to make an effort to stay at 600 mg because of my diet. The diet I was on was 200 to 400 mg if I did not force myself to use that salt shaker). Sodium is a necessary part of your diet. I found Na amounts over 1000 mg were too much for my body. I have hypertension and heart palpitations with shortness of breath. My thyroid lab readings became perfect and the doctor took me off thyroid medication and blood pressure medication. My heart palliation’s and shortness of breath at 3 to 5 a.m. every night quit after one month. All my problems resumed significantly when I got off my diet plan/exercise in recent years. Of interest one older doctor who had been in the profession for forty years claimed I was only one of two people that went from a TSH level of 0.0 to 4.0 (the upper range of normal) after quitting the medication. Thyroid problems have resumed along with blood pressure, heart and heart palliation’s. I have now resumed the diet and exercise plan and tracking. I’ll send in an update after three months.<br/>I’m only one person, so put 400 people on the same program I’ve been on and see what happens. Problem of course is finding 200 honest people out of that 400 that do not fib on the diet and exercise database or guess. It also takes will power to stick to a program. I stuck with it for ten years then quit for miscellaneous reasons. Remove the ones from the database that show no improvement who refuse to swear under oath and take a lie detector test!<br/>Salt (Sodium) DOES raise your blood pressure. I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 130/90. She told me to control my salt (sodium 1500mg limit) and I had a check up two days later with my blood pressure 108/87. Anytime I eat lots of salty foods, I get a spike in my pressure. I am definitely salt sensitive.<br/>SALT (SODIUM) DOES affect your blood pressure. You have to be careful (it sneaks up on you good) and adjust your diet to limit sodium intake and watch for signs of your pressure raising. Especially when your body behavior changes.<br/>Work out as well! If you are lazy or not that active, take 30 minute walks 5 days a week (150 minutes total) minimum to get a decent exercise.<br/>I think the point is that recommending a lower sodium diet, that maybe affects a specific set of people, those who already have hypertension and are salt sensitive, to an entire population is ridiculous. Another point is whether high salt intake leads to chronic cardiovascular problems, which is being touted as fact to the public but has no research to back it up. I consume way more sodium than the CDC recommends and my BP has never been higher than 117/70, my highest ever, normal about 100-110/65-70. Neither of our cases prove one way or the other the effects “high” sodium intake has on the general population.<br/>You may have low cellular potassium, high copper, low vitamin k2, low magnesium, low vitamin E, heavy metal toxicity such as lead, everyone is exposed to lead and fluoride, these things compound each other.<br/>Look at conditions that cause you to have this salt sensitivity such as low potassium high cortisol.<br/>Don’t just rest on salt because you likely will have multiple issues as well almost no-one just eats salt by itself.<br/>Salt is generally found in high simple sugar no fiber foods with additives.<br/>Understand guidelines are for the whole population not just for you, this is problematic because unrefined salt is not shown to be unhealthy for most people and to some it improves health and in making these guidelines with no recognition of biochemical individuality.<br/>Understand lowering HBP is not the be all and end all, this has been mechanically done by drugs in studies which show no improvement in outcomes and even worsening of symptoms outside of the sign of BP measurement.<br/>Things to consider, Olive leaf extract, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin k2, potassium, curcumin, stevia(the natural sweetener), magnesium, pomegranite, l-arginine, nattokinase, fish oil, cocoa, beetroot, alpha lipoic acid, bromelain, flax seed, celery, coq10, flax seed, hawthorne. All these improve BP and cardiovascular issues. You have a lot more in your toolkit than you think<br/>As for Sugar, women should limit their sugar (Total Carbs is what matters and watch out for certain sugar alcohols) 20g-30g a snack and 30g-45g each meal. Men should keep their snack the same as women 20g-30g a snack and 60g – 75g a meal. The lowest numbers are the lmit for diabetics of course.<br/>I believe that some people have a sensitivity to sodium. I’m convinced that I do. After being on 3 different BP meds at one time and still having uncontrolled hypertension, I started reading food labels and drastically reducing my sodium intake. Most processed foods are loaded with sodium. I have been able to stop 2 meds completely and reduce the third one to 1/4 the prescribed dosage. For me, reducing sodium has made a huge difference. Last night I took 10 mg of lisinopril, which is 1/4 of the prescribed daily dosage. Today my BP is too low, 105/48. I really have to consistently monitor it, as low BP isn’t much fun, either.<br/>Blood pressure drugs are ineffective, they fail to improve outcomes only the BP reading.<br/>You have reduced your intake of low potassium high salt high sugar low fiber junk foods, this was always going to lower your blood pressure.<br/>Salt is not the enemy you just require potassium and antioxidants to balance it out and lower stress.<br/>When people reduce sodium in this way you cant contribute it to salt itself, you have completely altered your dietary intake of many things, this is how people can be fooled into thinking its a single thing.<br/>This attribution of a singular cause to problems is constantly done in hypothesis and they tend to be completely bogus demonizing singular things like Co2, salt, saturated fat, cholesterol, lack of seratonin, even lack of the poison fluorides use.<br/>These are all myths that fail under scrutiny but continue to be upheld as causes by regulating bodies by cherry picking and dismissal of minimization of overwhelming contradictions. The pharmaceutical junk food and vegetable oil corporations benefit and misinform the public for profit to which the FDA racketeers for them killing off their competition.<br/>Medicine research and much of other research is a cesspool of incestuous deception between private interest and boosting the economy as well as politicians doctors and government profit.<br/>The editors of the journals studies are published in find most studies to be entirely lacking, conclusions to be spun towards confirmation bias and that we are in quite a dark age for science where belief, consensus and peer review are less about good science and more about blackballing competing belief and evidence that will damage profits and future grants.<br/>Yea, whatever. Believe what you want. I have been reading health books for years….DECADES…and I’ve have read in them EXACTLY what is printed in this article. There NEVER has been a proven link between salt and high blood pressure. Furthermore, in one of books it pointed out that salt is used to make stomach acid, and it’s ironic that as we age, the low sodium diet so often touted leads to digestive problems.<br/>Keep believing doctors who take 3 credits of Nutrition in college and pitch compounds that cause worse side effects than the actual disease.<br/>Doctors, who say Chiropractic is “not real medicine.” Read the Winsdor papers. A doctor who set out to prove Chiro was fake by doing autopsies found that 99 out of 100 organ failures were due to lack of nerve energy caused by “subluxations” which pinch the nerves and interrupt nerve energy flow. (I’m not a chiropractor).<br/>Go read books by Norman Walker, (especially “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.”), TC Fry, and Herbert M. Shelton (Superior Nutrition, Fasting can save your life). I’ve read them all.<br/>BOTTOM LINE this is an excellent article and I’m actually surprised to see the truth so openly posted in an article like this…but you believe what you want & take chemicals pushed by the medical profession…eat what you want, drink what you want, don’t exercise and when things go wrong just take a pill….<br/>I attempted to look up these “Winsdor Papers” and even Google doesn’t know what you are talking about. If you really want to win people over, you should actually post links to the information you want us to read.<br/>Guys you all are missing one point: sodium is poisonous to us. Even if does not raise BP, its still poison ;/ not good at all<br/>@Marco: You would die instantly without sodium in your body.<br/>I am not the same Marco as Mr. “Salt is poison”. Just to be clear<br/>Of course – everything in excess is bad – heck, even drinking too much water will kill you.<br/>Now, every person is different so you have to find what works for you. Mine, I like salted 🙂<br/>This article is misleading. Just because salt’s negative effect on blood pressure is a “theory” doesn’t mean we should ignore it. In fact most of medicine and science is carried out on plausible theories. The truth is a low salt diet is less harmful than a high salt diet and like all things the real moral of the story is moderation. Also this author contradicts themselves by saying there is “no evidence… Yes none” to support this theory, but then goes on to cite at least one study that shows the negative corrolatuon in humans and another involving rats. That’s evidence, at least some not none. Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that. Sure sometimes we are far from knowing but in this case there’s enough science behind salts impact on BP to make it worth considering. Also remember the human consumption of high salt quantities is a fairly new thing on the evolutionary scale, so it’s impact on our bodies is fairly unnatural.<br/>@Mike: “No evidence… Yes none” I think Scott is meaning “No reputable evidence” Or, rather, “No evidence that is not flawed.”<br/>“Everything in moderation” Yep, exactly. As Scott is fond of saying, “Even water will kill you in high enough doses.” He even once told me a story of a woman he attempted to treat for this very thing- she drank massive amounts of water and ended up dying from it.<br/>“Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that.” I don’t think any doctors would ever say that. Maybe a century or two ago. But there is an amazing amount of good science involved here these days. We are far from knowing everything, but it’s certainly not black magic or just guess work, as that would seem to imply.<br/>Sorry to disagree with you Dave. But even on the sources of the video, the rise of blood pressure on high-salt diets is evident. While in the end of one of them, while talking about softdrinks and snacks companies:<br/>“Some of these companies have been preeminent in trying to create an artificial controversy doubting the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure,16,17 presumably in the hope of stopping or slowing down any reduction in population salt intake to protect soft drink sales.”<br/>Even, I’m not a specialist in the area, the lacks of a literature review in source about this matter is disturbing.<br/>oh diets that are processed foods with low fat high sugar high additive, observational studies are meaningless, these people are eating copious amounts of sugar each year. If you think corporations are trying to be allowed to use more salt its ridiculous distraction in doing anything to not look at the sugar metabolism syndrome epidemic.<br/>How moronic that you think observational studies matter for anything other than proposing a hypothesis, you then use intervention and double-blind placebo studies with no variables to prove them causal. THIS IS NOT DONE, this is also not done for cholesterol or saturated fat. You are a gullible victim of pathological science, when he says there is no evidence there is no evidence observational studies do no control for anything they are not an experiment, this is not how science works. You do understand cochrane are perhaps the most neutral group for clinical study in the world and they reviewed 150 trials and 13 population studies. Here you are saying their findings are wrong based on what? nothing other than your belief based on a hypothesis with no evidence.<br/>I suggest you read the book “Salt”. It is mostly a geopolitical historical account of salt in our civilization, but it also has a good deal of science in it. We built our civilization on salt.<br/>The first paragraph says ” just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence,” I believe that since this is a scientific minded website it shouldn’t use the word theory in this context, since in science, a theory is an accepted explanation of a phenomenon, proven by testing.<br/>Yeah, he should have used hypothesis. I’m going to have to look up the history of theory and see if anyone knows how it ended up with two such different meanings.<br/>For a medical professional (which leads to an assumption of advanced education), you have a horrible grasp of grammar and spelling. This discredits much of what you say, in my mind. Having someone else review your work before publishing would go a long way.<br/>I will continue to listen to my cardiologist on this matter and limit my salt intake.<br/>@Mark: Something you’ll find seemingly true about a large number of medical professionals, the stereotype of their handwriting being horrible is generally correct. (Scott’s is particularly bad.) And their technical writing can also sometimes be particularly terrible, pre-edit. (They study medicine and the human body, not writing, after all) But, in over 100+ articles Scott has written, he has never been shown to be wrong on a main point (and only a few cases of being wrong on a minor point). Typos? Awkward sentence? You will always find at least one of these in each of his articles, despite my sincerest efforts to get rid of them all. But in the end, I care about accuracy much more than grammar. Both would be good, but finding a writer of Scott’s particular expertise and ability to think critical and process vast amounts of medical knowledge is extremely difficult. These people aren’t a dime a dozen. 🙂<br/>But really, the strength of Scott’s arguments are never based on his extensive medical knowledge. That just helps him thoroughly vet the various studies on the subject where most would get lost in the terminology, let alone be able to think critically about them and their methodology. The strength of the argument is the studies themselves. In this one, you’d do well to actually read the two Cochrane reviews, and perhaps forward them to your cardiologist for his/her thoughts.<br/>Don’t be surprised if he/she has already ready them though, and maybe even agrees with them. What doctors tell their patients doesn’t always line up with what they actually know or believe to be true. Particularly in cases like this where lawsuits may be a very real possibility if they told you to eat all the salt you wanted, then you died of a heart issue (but having nothing to do with the salt), then your family sues them and cites what various government agencies say on the subject, rather than what the medical world actually thinks. 🙂 Watching your sodium isn’t likely to hurt either, but covers the cardiologists’ backside. (I actually had an interesting discussion about this with Scott just last night about a doctor he was discussing this with who said something very similar as to why despite that he knows sodium isn’t going to be harmful in this way, he still tells certain of his patients to watch their sodium intake.)<br/>In the end, as I always say, “Question everything,” but also when questioning, do the research to find the answers too, and then double check that research just to make sure. 🙂 And, maybe don’t make the mistake of equating grammar and writing ability with knowledge of a subject or intelligence. I’ve worked with a ton of writers. I can say, journalists (and other such people with a writing background) are great at writing… They almost all are horrid at research, which surprised me on the journalists, but maybe explains a lot about the state of media reporting on scientific studies. Funny enough, the best combo of writing ability and research seems to be lawyers. They are phenomenal at both in my experience. Scientists, or people with a science background, tend to be poor at writing, but incredible at research and critical thinking. Of course, that’s only going with a sample-size of a few dozen writers I’ve worked with, and there is one exception I’ve found in that, but it’s a trend I’ve observed.<br/>I think everyone must be different. For me salt raises my blood pressure a lot. I check the bl pr 4-6x a day. Stays low enough when i stay under 300 mg of salt. As soon as i eat a lot of salt, like chinese food or even a meat and cheese sub or two slices of pizza my bl pr goes to 170/98. It takes a couple days to get the salt out of my body. Then it will go down to 130/80 and sometimes a bit lower. I am 67.<br/>you just offered up things containing large amounts of simple carbohydrates, also containing wheat. Sugar has high osmolality but is ignored due to the weight applied to salt<br/>Dietary wheat elimination alone can lower bp by 20-40 mmHG. The company life extension says this also beneficially optimizes blood lipid profiles.<br/>Do you see how you are perhaps basing what you see on assumption based on what you have been told based on the hypothesis that has no evidence.<br/>cardiovascular issues in observational studies only found a correlation with people eating the very large amount of 5 grams of salt a day, you can imagine what amount of junk foods they are eating to attain this amount.<br/>If your problem is salt you have an underlying condition causing it because you are not getting a high amount in any way, however you are also ignoring other causes which is the problem when singular things are touted as the main contributing factor when no evidence suggests they are the cause.<br/>consider your cellular potassium, copper, lead exposure, magnesium, vitamin E intake, coq10 levels, irritants and stress that can increase coagulation and vessel constriction.<br/>If I may comment on the whole spelling/grammar controversy… in my experience from observing people, the populace (at least the intelligent ones, my whole family is high IQ and my husband is a genius, literally, and as I have no lower-intelligence friends for a control group, I can only speak from my observations of my family and husband’s family,) is divided into two types: math-people and word-people. My father was a math person, as was I when I was very small, however, I lived with my mother, who is most definitely a words person, my whole life, leading to my developing into a words person. My husband may very well be the smartest person I’ve ever met, but from his spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, you’d never know it. He’s a computer repair tech, can fix anything, highly versatile in his job abilities, can solve algebra problems that I’m struggling with for minutes at a time with just a glance, but can’t spell our son’s name.<br/>As far as I can tell, scientists tend to be math people more than word people. (Just for the record, one of my previous jobs was research, and I’m a grammar Nazi and sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>I was wondering if I could ask the author of this article for a small favor.<br/>At the beginning I read this sentence in regard to salt intake:<br/>“But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize [it is just a theory] and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence…”<br/>Here you are using “Theory” in its popular parlance. WHich is fine and all. The problem is that this is a scientific related article and when a theory is not supported by evidence we call it a “Hypothesis”.<br/>Those of us that write in the scientific realm should make an effort to make this distinction, mostly because the next time I get some Young Earth Creationist telling me evolution is “just a theory” I swear I am going to start jumping up and down like a Chimpanzee and make backward sammerault. Then I’ll throw feces at him/her.<br/>I am sure you don’t want such a scene to become reality. Heck, you probably don’t want to think it up in your mind.<br/>So let’s start a campaign to call a Theory a “a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena” and call anything that is meant to be pulled from one’s rear orifice an “Hypothesis”.<br/>BTW: I know the dictionary return both meanings. FOr the sake of Science, let’s change the meaning back since we already have a good working word for “I just pulled this out of my ass”.<br/>@Marco: That’s a good point. I’ll start working that distinction in to future articles. 🙂<br/>Not a single legitimate conclusion can be drawn from a single blood pressure measurement. BP varies widely even from moment to moment. I have many times seen 160/100 drop to 130/75 over the course of a few minutes. As well, BP measuring equipment is highly variable and susceptible to wide variations from things like cuff size and user variations.<br/>Any conclusions drawn from a few measurements are nothing more than speculation and wishful thinking.<br/>First, this is not a peer-reviewed journal article. I agree, the correct use of “theory” has been obfuscated by the colloquial “just a hunch” version. But, let’s move on, ok?<br/>I don’t get that the article is in the least bit misleading. I do get that the author makes the point that apparently is lost on many — “As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.”<br/>He also mentions to think critically. So, if you don’t believe him, a) continue with your belief, or b) find out for yourself. Do the legwork. Read the articles. Now you have a starting point. Thank him for that.<br/>In my opinion, focusing on the occasional grammatical error or “theory vs. hunch” debate unnecessarily diminishes the author’s intent. My takeaway is that this article helps challenge my assumptions about what I thought was already scientifically concluded. I learned something. That’s the point.<br/>@Michael Stelly I am not sure if you were referring specifically to my post in regard to the usage of “theory”, but I assure you that my comment was not intended to criticize the writer at all. At least not in the same terms as a grammatical or spelling “error”.<br/>My comment is not about an “error” rather it is a suggestion that those of us that read and write about science do our part to reclaim the usage of the word “theory” from the mainstream or that at least we try.<br/>There are those that comment on obvious spelling errors and I agree they are not important in the context of the information provided in the article (although I agree they can be distracting and I am speaking from a non native English speaker), but unless their number and character is such that they make understanding the article difficult or even impossible, you won’t find me posting about them.<br/>The word “theory” on the other hand is a word that is being actively used by certain factions of the science / religion discussion to discount 200 years of scientific advancement and it is being actively used to mislead children into discounting science as a whole.<br/>If you have watched the Nye – Ham debate, Gawker asked some creationists to write a question to evolution supporters on a piece of paper and they published these questions in the form of pictures. Invariably the “it’s just a theory” question appeared.<br/>It’s in that spirit that I have asked the curators of this website to try to use the word in its scientific meaning. If we in the science and technical fields don’t do that, we cannot expect those that want to distort science for their objectives to do it on their own.<br/>So, with all due respect, I won’t take your advice. I will certainly let slide silly spelling errors but this is important to me and it should be important to all of us that love science.<br/>no one distorts science more than evolutionists, inference and speculation based on an assumption of fact are not evidence. No field has as many hoaxes and assumptions as evolution.<br/>Continuing to use the flawed contrasting argument and assumption that because creation must be wrong evolution must be true is not science, the evidence does not show macroevolution to be possible at this point under any of the many current competing theories based solely on mutation and natural selection. I would suggest another mechanism must be found.<br/>As it stands contradictory evidence is completely ignored or even claimed as evidence of a more complex process but still a proof of evolution when it is no such thing in all cases.<br/>We currently have evidence for abiogenesis that it is an absolute fact as is microevolution absolutely correct, however, in terms of macroevoltuion I would suggest science returned to being based on evidence not an assumption of fact and skewing of data to induce it too fit the theory.<br/>As it stands evolution is not science it is a belief much like the big bang theory which has massive conflicting evidence that in the past when people used evidence to prove or disprove theories this theory would have been shelved, the combination of both these theories is akin to a religion, the religion of secular humanists. It is as political as they come the communities that uphold these beliefs black ball and ad hominem they cannot stand on the evidence but on intimidation. Studies show ad hominem is as useful as reasoned argument, this is used by illigitamate science suche as Co2 based climate alarmism and macroevolution which currently do not have evidence in their favor yet use the same types of propaganda and attacks suggesting anyone opposing them is anti-science or a moron.<br/>I suggest reading http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>People who do not agree with evolution don’t automatically believe creation, the evolutionist always attacks and distracts from their own weak argument creates their own strawman of what others believe and assume based on their own often moronic assumptions that they are backed by evidence when they are not.<br/>One fact I would like to add:<br/>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are another piece of evidence in this controversy. Interestingly, thiazides are called diuretics but when taken daily this diuretic effect becomes almost zero. After a period of chronic thiazide therapy, the primary benefit these medications provide is that they increase the elimination of sodium and chloride ions from the blood by way of the Na/Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule (along with other effects such as retention of calcium). Despite losing the diuretic effect thiazides retain their blood pressure lowering effects long-term and are one of the medications used first line for lowering blood pressure. This lowering effect is generally attributed to the elimination of sodium and seems to be in line with the idea that high sodium levels do increase blood pressure.<br/>Believe it or not. Salt appears to lower my BP. If I eat too many chips I actually get dizzy from low BP. Can’t say I get it.<br/>This “theory” is simply stupid. Salt DOES increase blood pressure big time! It’s a fact, observed, monitored. Accidentally eat some pretty salty stuff one day than needed a week of diuretics to get rid of all that salt from the body and bring the blood pressure from 190-200 (!!yes, that high it got!!!) back to normal (120-130). So don’t tell stories which aren’t true.<br/>Not all people respond the same to dietary salt. My suggestion for us is to take note of the sodium level in our normal lab results in minimal annual physicals.<br/>From childhood, I am used to take more salt with my meals, but never faced the problem of High BP, instead sometimes it goes below normal. I Googled this problem & came to the conclusion that my body needs salt more than normal to compensate for genetically transmitted ‘Low BP’ problem. So? Your Brain is the instructor for your health. You must follow its orders to stay Really Healthy!<br/>Well, I’m just a nutritionist (like a University Nutrition major that will be graduating in May) and maybe what I learnt is bull, but after being thought about the pathophysiology of how sodium can impact blood pressure, I find that the recommendation makes sense, but you would need to do more than just cut sodium. One thing that’s important is the sodium: potassium ratio (ie you eat a bunch of high processed, sodium added foods compared to fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables). I’ll admit that not everyone is salt sensitive and that we have consciously decided, in the health field, to assume that everyone is because testing for salt-sensitiveness (if that’s a word!) is expensive, long, and impractical. But the idea that there is no good plausible evidence linking salt and hypertension is false. Here’s just 6 articles. These aren’t the ones that were given by our professors to read (though if you want me to find them for you I’m sure I can), but they’re good one’s nonetheless and you don’t need a special University code or membership to access them. Anyways, here you go in case you want to read more:<br/>Do any of those show that there’s a correlation without other factors? You say “you would need to do more than just cut sodium”… is there evidence that doing those other actions without cutting sodium doesn’t work as well as cutting sodium too?<br/>Did you not read? Cochrane used 150 trials and 13 studies right? so you have 6, this is your “education” at work. Brainwashing and then confirmation biased search for support of the faulty hypothesis that has been found to be not of high quality already.<br/>If Cochrane did not use it it is not a high quality article, if it did then the support was not significant in the article. The osmolality mechanism applies to high sugar diets yet its all about salt<br/>The problem here is low quality studies are published constantly that people infer causation from where they can’t possibly do so as they did not control all the variables.<br/>The same thing is done for the lipid hypothesis and the cholesterol hypothesis.<br/>These are also myths, cholesterol from all data is inversely related to heart disease slightly.<br/>Statins absolute risk reduction for heart disease is 1.4% this is hardly significant, statins effects for decreasing heart problems in those already having a heart attack may be entirely due to their effect as an anticoagulant. Once again pathological junk science is being used to push treatments without recognizing mechanisms and variables. Most people will be harmed by inhibiting vitamin k coq10 and cholesterol synthesis via statins yet doctors backed by pharmaceutical greed promote giving them to everyone.<br/>Saturated fat has no mechanism via which it can raise cholesterol, no study of oil replacement purely substituted fat for oil in double blinds controls all variables and the closer they come to doing so the worse the outcomes for PUFA intervention becomes increasing all causes of death.<br/>Like is said the trials are low quality there is not much will to overturn hypothesis that regulating bodies and doctors have a religious belief in that is not backed by evidence. This misinformation leads to poor health and pharmaceutical profit.<br/>I have been torn between to eat more salt or not, because eating more salt reduces my heart rate and BP and makes me sleep better; my hands and feet feel full and warm. My sweat volume increase as I bike or walk. But then after taking it for a week or 2 then I notice that BP becomes persistently high; which makes me feel I did wrong by eating. What this article mentions is fluid volume increase which is interesting. Before increasing my salt intake my fingers feel thin. Maybe after fluid levels feel normal cut back on salt to normal levels. So I am just hypothesizing that people who have are salt sensitive have good fluid volume and should watch salt intake, others can take salt but stop when it feels full. Basically use salt maintain fluid volume.<br/>Based on self-experimentation, I think maintaining fluid volume is very important. At times, I find that I feel thirsty and drink water and that it keeps coming out; that calls for some salt intake. Basically, I do not eat canned food or much fast foods, my salt intake is what is purposely added in cooking. After exercise, (eating by the book and working out etc cause problems too) I notice that when I stand up from sitting position, I feel dizzy but not normally. I think I may be sweating out salt and , of course, I drink a lot of water during the exercise. I am not proposing eating more salt. What I am stating is the way the body is telling you that your salt is depleted is when you are not feeling full in your feet and hands. I think this is correct to some extent, as the body works more on concentration of things than the absolute amounts. It is not a comprehensive theory as there are other things that may increase blood volume, you may be already having too much salt in blood etc. For the record, my sodium in the blood is always near the low end of the range so my err wont push me outside of the range.<br/>Ok what is the conclusion? do I use the salt shaker now or not? I have been holding too long.<br/>I think this article is irresponsible in that salt absolutely does raise bp in those who have a salt sensitivity. If I eat something very salty I can literally go into hypertensive crisis in a matter of an hour.<br/>This type of sensitivity is common and to not mention it (because it does not fit with the authors theory?) is dangerous.<br/>@Jim porter: “because it does not fit with the authors theory?” The “author’s theory” doesn’t exist. That’s really not what we do here. This is an article simply writing about scientific studies on the topic and saying what they say, so you don’t have to sift through them and all the medical jargon; we do it for you- essentially what we write about reflects the current state of human knowledge on the subject at hand. If it changes at some point, we update the article. In this case, however, most notably the two Cochrane reviews are pretty convincing: “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.” There are exceptions to every rule, and seemingly you are one and that’s very interesting if so and it would be interesting to learn the root cause. But, again, we look at what the scientific studies say and try to reflect that in what we write. Essentially we write a form of “light-reading” style entertaining survey papers on subjects, rather than write research papers.<br/>Stressing about salt will likely kill you long before salt itself will. Do what makes you happy and you will likely live longer than otherwise; and even if you don’t, at least you’ll enjoy the time you have.<br/>I believe the problem is when salt is mixed with fat and THAT causes high blood pressure. For example, someone talked about theirs rising when eating crisps/chips-that’s because the chips contain fat. The same would apply say to french fries or other fatty dishes. However, if you were to sprinkle salt on something like fruit, it wouldn’t have the same effect and not raise your blood pressure.<br/>I do think sodium gets a bad rap and some people actually do consume too little. I think having salt with fruit or salads is o.k. but the problem is the salt/fat combination and if you think about it, that’s where people usually get their salt-in potato chips, french fries, heavily seasoning meats, in creamy dishes, etc.<br/>The person who wrote this article adds nothing of value to the discussion about high blood pressure except to encourage people to stick their heads in the sand.<br/>I have been wrestling with high blood pressure for about 12 years since a serious accident caused me to be physically inactive for about a year after the accident.<br/>High blood pressure can be controlled with and without medications and individuals respond differently to different treatments and there are natural cures for this affliction.<br/>High blood pressure can cause strokes, brain hemmorhages and contribute to diabetes and kidney disease.<br/>The balance between potassium and sodium in our blood is very critical and unfortunately most doctors don’t have a clue about the effect that nutrition and proper hydration has on this condition.<br/>Most of the doctors I have been to just give out prescriptions which may or may not work.<br/>There are natural substances which have enabled me to lower my blood pressure within a few days from extremely high to almost normal while doctors and pharmacists will say that medications (like Cozaar and Norvasc)may take up to a month to work.<br/>I’ve found that the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water<br/>had significant effects.<br/>Drinking this once or twice per day has had a very significant effect in my case; my blood pressure went from 220/95 to 130/90 within 3 days.<br/>Garlic (deodorized) also helps and fruit or vegetable juices with lowered salt content and high potassium content also help. (V-8 low salt or V-8 green).<br/>This is not wishful thinking; it has to do with chemistry; this doesn’t mean that everyone will respond the same to these treatments but I disagree very strongly when someone says that salt has no effect<br/>on blood pressure.<br/>This seems to me to be irresponsible and cavalier, unless of course you work for one of the salt manufacturers.<br/>Salt is necessary and most table salts have iodine in them, which is an essential nutrient for humans.<br/>Drinking sufficient amounts of pure water is also very important; something that my doctors never bothered to mention.<br/>This enables the body to rid itself of excess salt and helps the body cleanse itself.<br/>There are many natural substances and some foods (like pesto) which can help lower blood pressure and you can find many posts on the internet about them.<br/>Web Md and The Mayo Clinic both have posts on the subject and I trust them a hell of alot more than the author of this post.<br/>This appears to me to be an exercise in defending the indefensible.<br/>To what purpose?<br/>Who was Hippocrates anyway and what the hell did he know?<br/>I have extremely low blood pressure. If I stand up too fast, I’ll faint flat on my face. My doctor told me to eat as much salt as I want, no worries.<br/>In any case, I’ll take all of this advice with a pinch of… you know what. ;-D<br/>I eat a lot of salt (and I do mean a *LOT*). A few years ago after getting fed up with constantly being told how bad this is, I decided to put it to the test. As a Ph.D. I know how to scientifically plan a test, and over several months minimizing as many variables as possible, I tested my blood pressure while at my regular salt intake versus low salt intake. The results were pretty much as expected, although some people /may/ be slightly intolerant to relatively high levels of salt intake, for me there was no difference at all. I have returned to eating food the way I like it (salty), and tell anybody who advises against this they simply don’t know what they are talking about LOL<br/>I’m 27 female. I started having high blood pressure while I was taking Accutane a year and a half ago (Accutane increases cholesterol buildup). What I experienced was intense, my pulse was at 120bpm, I was dizzy, my hands clamped up into an unusual claw shape and they tingled until they lost feeling. I thought I was actually dying. I was told it was just a panic attack, but I’ve never had any real anxiety issues. I was given oxygen for an entire hour when suddenly I started craving salt. I asked my friend to run to mcdonalds and get me some extra salty fries. Within minutes of eating all that salt, my blood pressure was back to normal, my hands got their feeling back, and I could walk and breath normally again.<br/>I find the things that trigger it the most for me are a lack of sleep, not eating anything all day, corn, wheat, and chemical salts such as MSG. But sea salt and normal table salt don’t make it worse, they make it better! With that said, I’ve always had blood test results showing high levels of potassium. Could this somehow be involved? My Dr. Just shrugs it off as caused by my love for potatoes and citrus fruits lol<br/>You might need a new doctor high potassium or hyperkalemia can cause the episodes you describe and Accutane can cause hyperkalemia.<br/>Potassium and sodium are obviously related as your cells constantly exchange these into and out of cells to maintain higher intracellular concentrations of potassium.<br/>Cortisol which raises with sleep deprivation, not eating and other stresses reverses this process of potassium concentration into the cell, but is meant to increase potassium excretion, cellular uptake of sodium absorption and sodium retention in the kidneys, there may be something going wrong with this process with potassium not being excreted. The normal reason is the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system which regulates blood pressure.<br/>Salt nourishes adrenals but you might want to get some more vitamin C which is concentrated there as well as in the pituitary gland as these regulate your cortisol and vit c lowers cortisol and stress likely lessening the severity of episodes.<br/>Things to look into, magnesium, vitamin e, adrenal glandular, copper/zinc levels, kidney and adrenal function.<br/>Pharmacist here. Thank you for all the helpful comments on this site. One can see all the intelligently written posts from people who have reduced their high blood pressure by limiting salt. I am one of these people. My blood pressure a year ago was running on average 180/120 when not medicated, and when on 3 different medications, on average 140/90. After feeling awful, either from adverse effects from the meds or from headaches from high blood pressure, I decided to alter my diet. The results I achieved were stunning. Blood pressure perfectly normal, 120/80. No headaches, or feeling like my throat was swollen, or feeling like my head was too hot….I could go on and on. I did this with NO expensive products. I just, as much as is possible nowadays in the U.S., ate non-processed foods, and avoided all added salt. Notice, all “added” salt. As many have correctly pointed out, salt is necessary to human life. And many foods naturally contain all the salt we need, so it is not necessary to add any. Listening to these supposed experts, I wonder how any humans ever survived 10,000 years ago if they weren’t lucky enough to find a salt block to lick every day! I read one comment about someone who has had good results from “the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water”. I would challenge him and others to just try the lemon juice with water. I find that if I clean myself out with just one glass of lemon-water once a week, it has had a splendid effect on my health. The other ingredients may help, but it would be an interesting experiment for you. So I, like, many, many others, am sensitive to salt. Maybe some people can eat a huge amount of salt on a regular basis with no adverse health effects. That is not true for many of us, and it is offensive when so called “professionals” or “scientists” dispute this. One thing I always tell my patients, “When it comes to your health, trust yourself above all others”. If you are convinced a particular medication is making you feel sick, and your doctor or pharmacist imply it’s all in your head, trust yourself, not them. If you, like me, feel a thousand times better when you limit your consumption of salt or processed foods, then please, keep doing what you are doing, and don’t listen to those who suggest otherwise! You will be healthier and happier. Thanks for listening, my friends from far away.<br/>While it’s certainly possible that you are salt sensitive, when you decided to alter your diet, you changed many other things in addition to how much salt you ate. Two of the easiest ways to lower blood pressure without altering salt are 1. lose weight. 2. eat more veggies and fruits (aka foods rich in potassium). Numerous clinical and observational studies have shown that the sodium-potassium ratio is likely more important than how much sodium you eat. [Note that this only applies to the 99.999999% of humanity who eats between 3k and 6k mgs of sodium a day. Salt probably is a problem if you’re eating way out of the normal range, like 12,000mg + of sodium a day.]<br/>I was going to basically say the same thing. I had high blood pressure… I did a 30 day Paleo Challenge… All clean from the earth foods. I actually increased my salt intake by introducing a lot of salty beef jerky and pickled food into my diet for snacking. Not only did my blood pressure end up near perfect… I also lost 16 pounds. I wasn’t even someone you would really consider over weight to begin with… 178 lbs to 162 lbs in 30 days. My weird headaches were gone… the whole nine yards that come with high blood pressure. I’m convinced the salt and blood pressure are not related… and I think its a cop out to people who really need to get on an actual healthy diet.<br/>This article is dangerous and might convince someone to use all the salt they want. But all I have to do is eat a couple of big bags of Potato chips and I am getting 180/90 within a couple of days, stay off the salt then for 3-4 days and hydrate well, back to 130/70. Now “maybe” I am hypersensitive, but since this has repeated a half dozen times, I avoid salt. There is plenty in normal foods/<br/>Looks like you dont know what you are talking about… read Curt Nicol DD PhD entry below. and read again this article… you’ve been biased by exposure to the doctors who got biased by years and years of all the yada..yada..yada… read the article again. Of course, you are not going to start eating salt by the pound… everything would taste awful anyway.<br/>What is dangerous is advice and treatments with no scientific basis based on hypothesis alone, the collateral effect of reducing most peoples regular salt intakes is eating less processed food containing huge amounts of refined or simple carbs, highly oxidation prone oils, denatured substances, contaminants and additives.<br/>Reducing these will lead to improved overall nutrition.<br/>Limiting salt on its own with no other variables will show little to no effect in most people and can be detrimental to others.<br/>Me to. I’ve entered a detail comment of stop and start tests that 100% proved my hypothesis that Na was one of the large contributors to blood pressure. Takes an effort to document and record methods and result. Mine was as high as 205/115. I got it down to a consistent 100/65 for two years. My work is documented in this comment section but has yet to show up.<br/>A lot of people here saying that eating a bag of chips increases their blood pressure. Do they not realize it isn’t a health food? Do they think it possibly doesn’t contain all the wrong stuff?<br/>There has to be some other high sodium food they can use to show how salt affects their blood pressure.<br/>That’s right… what is bad is the oil and grease that is going the the pipes and constraining them… plus potato chips, it’s all starch, which turns to sugar, then fat …<br/>I would not be credulous enough to think for a minute, that salt is NOT related to high blood pressure, and increased body temperatures, for it certainly DOES. I reduced my 160 over 80 blood pressure down to 119 over 81 in a few weeks by cutting my salt intake severely. Why is it everytime I eat a several servings of potato chips, or eat Mc Donald’s french fries, I get immediately face flushed and feverish? I have even felt and heard, yes, the constricted veins in my own head, after having high blood pressure, dilate, expand, and break open again,after drinking cups, and cups of water, with the disappearance of the fever, disappearance of discomfort or congested head feeling, and reduced blood pressure.<br/>This really bothers me, and I have t confess to being somewhat confused now. I LOVE salt and can consume more in a single meal than you are supposed to consume in a day. It never seemed to affect my b.p.<br/>Then when my b.p. started increasing as I got older, my doc said to cut out salt. So I did…with no real effect. I was actually admitted into hospital with a serious infection, only to find that when I was discharged, I had been kept on a low sodium diet, even though on admission, my sodium level was dangerously low.<br/>This all made me believe that the dangers of sodium were only a myth, at least for me anyway. But then my wife got ill. Her b.p. was being constantly monitored as it kept going too low. They used to inject her with “sodium” (salty water I believe) and her blood pressure would come up almost immediately. This was intravenously however.<br/>So is it that I’m not salt-sensitive, or is it something about the stomach that acts a s barrier (so ingested salt does not affect you), while IV salt will?<br/>For something that is so fundamental in medical advice, it is so frustrating that there seems to be so little research, at least quality research done on it.<br/>Conversely, on a later admission to hospital, they had me on low sodium again (once and idiot puts it on your medical records, it seems impossible to get it off…) and gave me a blood pressure reducing medication. My b.p. dropped through the floor and was worrying them at one stage.<br/>BP medications are not evidenced to improve outcomes or be safe in most situations. Modern medicine is quite dangerous they kill people constantly with what they prescribe.<br/>Your wife may have kidney and adrenal problems while you more likely have vascular problems. Consider the possible environmental causes, you drink water with fluoride that increases absorption of lead, lack of antioxidants like ala, vit a/e/c/d/k2 can lead to increased oxidative stress arterial sclerosis and calcification of arteries restricting the ability of vessals to dialate, increased irritant exposure raises vasoconstriction and coagulation by increased seratonin release and lower amounts of nitric oxide produced by endothelial damage, low vitamin c leads to lessened collagen synthesis as does raised cortisol levels, both lead to poor circulation.<br/>These things can cause problems anywhere.<br/>I just spent an hour writing up a comment. My doctor wishes to see it. I doe not show up. What is going on? Did I waste my time? Please respond.<br/>Excellent article. Articles of this type bring out the health nutters and know-it-alls….just take a look at the comments. This also reminds me of the “global warming”….”climate change” (or whatever they are calling it this week) “experts” who preach it like it was gospel when they too have no definitive proof. | Fapt sau mit: Sodiul crește tensiunea arterială<br/>Ei bine, Matt, se pare că o dietă bogată în sodiu nu poate ridica tensiunea arterială, nici nu are nici un fel de efect advers asupra sănătății cardiovasculare. Dar voi acoperi teoria cu privire la motivul pentru care sarea ridică tensiunea arterială mai jos – doar realizați că este doar o teorie și una care nu este susținută de multe dovezi științifice solide (și există mai multe dovezi care spun că nu face decât face).<br/>Dezbaterea despre consumul prea mare de sare a existat încă din anii 1960. Aproape toate organizațiile guvernamentale de sănătate majore îmbrățișează ideea că consumul prea mare de sare este dăunător sănătății. Cele mai multe publicații de știri majore raportează aceste recomandări și oamenii tind să încerce să le urmeze. Acesta este cel mai probabil motivul pentru care majoritatea dintre noi, în special persoanele în vârstă cu probleme cardiace, știu să reducă cantitatea de sare pe care o consumăm. Aceia dintre noi cărora le place ideea că orice recomandare este susținută de dovezi solide, trebuie să facă un pas înapoi pe aceasta. După cum sa menționat, în prezent nu există dovezi solide că sarea vă va crește cronic tensiunea arterială. Da, niciuna.<br/>Deci, de ce majoritatea organizațiilor de sănătate au împins ideea dietelor cu conținut scăzut de sodiu? Teoria din spatele presupunerii lor este solidă, și există unele studii care arată un risc minor de tensiune arterială ridicată cu un aport extrem de ridicat de sare. Din păcate, există multe alte studii care nu arată nici o creștere, și încă unele care arată reducerea aportului de sare ar putea crește de fapt tensiunea arterială! Să ne uităm la controversa mai în detaliu.<br/>Ideea sarii va creste tensiunea arteriala are de-a face cu presiunea osmotica. Osmoza este deplasarea unui solvent (în acest caz apa) prin membrane semipermeabile (cum ar fi pereții celulelor), din zonele cu concentrație mai mică de solut (în acest caz sare) în zonele cu concentrație mai mare de solut. Acest lucru echilibrează în mod natural concentrația de solut pe ambele părți ale membranei. (Această presiune osmotică este, de asemenea, motivul pentru care sarea poate fi utilizată pentru conservarea cărnii.)<br/>Deci teoria spune că atunci când mâncăm prea multă sare, fluxul sanguin are mai mult sodiu în el decât zonele înconjurătoare ale corpului nostru. Acest lucru determină apa din acele zone să fie trasă în fluxul sanguin. Creșterea apei în artere și vene determină o creștere a presiunii în aceste artere și vene. Sarea în sine acționează, de asemenea, ca un iritant în artere, determinându-le să se contracte. Acest lucru este, de asemenea, considerat a crește tensiunea arterială.<br/>La urma urmei, putem face ca procesul de tragere a apei prin membrane să se întâmple din nou și din nou în laborator. Întrebarea este, se întâmplă de fapt acest lucru în corpul nostru, și acest lucru provoacă de fapt hipertensiune pe termen lung (tensiune arterială ridicată)?<br/>În 1969, Lewis Dahl a depus mărturie în fața "comitetului select pentru nutriție și nevoi umane" al senatorului George McGovern. El a fost îngrijorat de concentrațiile ridicate de sodiu în alimentele pentru copii și a crezut că acest lucru ar putea provoca creșterea tensiunii arteriale pe termen lung a oamenilor. Raționamentul său a fost că studiile efectuate pe șobolani au arătat creșteri ale tensiunii arteriale la șobolani.<br/>Conversația despre sare și hipertensiune arterială a început să circule între organizațiile de sănătate. Institutul Național de Sănătate, în 1972, a început să introducă "Programe de educație a tensiunii arteriale ridicate". Ca dovadă, ei au subliniat observațional, populațiile care au mâncat foarte puțin sodiu au avut incidente scăzute de tensiune arterială ridicată. Ei au subliniat, de asemenea, modelarea șobolanului. Oamenii de știință de la acea vreme au pus la îndoială acest lucru, deoarece studiile pe șobolani i-au făcut să mănânce de 60 de ori mai mult decât o persoană obișnuită. De asemenea, au atras atenția asupra populațiilor care au mâncat diete cu conținut scăzut de sodiu, au mâncat, de asemenea, cantități mici de alte lucruri, cum ar fi zahărul (care afectează și osmoza).<br/>În ciuda obiecțiilor lor, în mod public, ideea dietelor bogate în sodiu care provoacă hipertensiune arterială a rămas aici și rămâne astăzi. Centrele pentru Controlul Bolilor, Institutul Național de Sănătate, Asociația Americană a Inimii și multe alte organizații promovează în prezent dietele cu conținut scăzut de sodiu.<br/>În ciuda frontului aparent unificat prezentat de aceste organizații distinse, controversa dintre oamenii de știință este extrem de aprinsă. În 1998, autorul premiat Taubes, a publicat "Știința politică a sării" în Journal of Science. "Controversa cu privire la beneficiile, dacă există, ale reducerii sării constituie acum una dintre cele mai lungi dispute vitriolice și suprarealiste din toată medicina."<br/>Un chirurg general într-un raport a scris, viteza cu care agențiile federale americane au îmbrățișat reducerea sodiului, "a stat în contrast puternic cu cât timp a durat pentru ca recomandările să apară cu privire la importanța reducerii nivelului de colesterol din sânge". El a remarcat, de asemenea, că diferența a fost și mai remarcabilă având în vedere absența cercetărilor publicate care au testat de fapt teoria. Pe de altă parte, Sir Micheal Rawlings, președintele Institutului Național pentru Sănătate și Excelență Clinică, care promovează dietele de reducere a sărurilor, a susținut că „îndrumarea (în elaborarea politicilor) se bazează pe cele mai bune dovezi disponibile. Cu toate acestea, este posibil ca dovezile să nu fie foarte bune și să fie rareori complete.” Nu este un argument foarte puternic pentru reducerea aportului de sare.<br/>Să ne uităm la câteva studii relativ recente. În 2008, cercetătorii italieni au început să publice rezultatele unei serii de studii clinice, toate dintre care au raportat că, în rândul pacienților cu insuficiență cardiacă, reducerea consumului de sare a crescut riscul de deces. Aceste studii au fost urmate de altele care au arătat în rândul diabeticilor de tip 1 și 2, europenii sănătoși și pacienții cu insuficiență cardiacă cronică, cei care au mâncat sare la limita inferioară a intervalului normal au fost mai susceptibili de a avea boli de inimă decât cei care au mâncat sare în intervalul mediu de normal.<br/>În 2011, două revizuiri Cochrane nu au găsit nicio dovadă că dietele sărace în sare fie îmbunătățesc, fie înrăutățesc sănătatea oamenilor. "După mai mult de 150 de studii clinice aleatorii și 13 studii de populație, fără un semnal evident în favoarea reducerii sodiului, o altă poziție ar putea fi acceptarea faptului că un astfel de semnal poate să nu existe".<br/>Chiar și în fața unei dovezi științifice clare care să susțină acest lucru și unii contrarii, în 2010, Centrele pentru Controlul și Prevenirea Bolilor, Institutul de Medicină și Societatea Americană de Hipertensiune au continuat să promoveze dietele cu conținut scăzut de sodiu ca mijloc de control al tensiunii arteriale ridicate.<br/>În cele din urmă, fiind un profesionist medical și cineva care are nevoie de dovezi clare pentru a lua o decizie cu privire la posibilitatea de a adăuga cantități copioase de sare pe cartofii prăjiți, mă bucur să constat că până acum există foarte puțin! Toate organizațiile majore de sănătate par să promoveze dietele cu conținut scăzut de sodiu, dar niciunul nu a publicat de fapt studii consistente care arată că dietele cu conținut scăzut de sodiu ajută la sănătate, în special nu la sănătatea cardiovasculară. Ceea ce mi se pare cel mai enervant, un animal de companie al meu, este că niciuna dintre aceste organizații nu le spune oamenilor că știința din spatele politicilor lor este controversată și ar putea fi complet greșită. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns și Sandro Galea au spus cel mai bine în articolul lor "Sare și sănătate publică"- "După o analiză atentă a dezbaterii despre sare, am ajuns la concluzia că ascunderea incertitudinii științifice este o greșeală care nu servește nici scopurilor științei, nici bunei politici."<br/>Deci ar trebui să ieşi şi să îneci totul în sare acum? Ca și în cazul majorității lucrurilor, dacă știința nu a fost în măsură să răspundă definitiv la întrebare într-un fel sau altul, și doriți să fiți în siguranță, mai degrabă decât să regretați, pur și simplu mergeți cu regula veche a "moderației în toate". Dacă ți-ar plăcea, ca și mie, să sare totul ca marginea unui pahar de margarita și moderație să fie blestemat, cel puțin acum vă puteți simți un pic mai bine despre asta, deoarece știința pare să se încline din ce în ce mai mult spre dietele cu conținut scăzut de sodiu fiind inutile și cele cu conținut ridicat de sodiu nu fiind dăunătoare deloc.<br/>Dacă v-a plăcut acest articol și faptele bonus de mai jos, s-ar putea să vă placă și:<br/>- De ce sarea îmbunătățește aroma<br/>- Ce înseamnă numerele într-un test de tensiune arterială și ce spun medicului<br/>- Ce cauzează brațele, picioarele și picioarele să "adormi"<br/>Top 5 trucuri de prim ajutor pe care toată lumea ar trebui să le știe<br/>Cum să eliminați o pată proaspătă de covor cu nimic altceva decât sare<br/>- Tensiunea arterială ridicată nu este nici o boală, nici o boală în sine. Este doar un factor de risc pentru alte probleme. De exemplu, dacă aveți hipertensiune arterială cronică, riscul de a avea un atac de cord sau accident vascular cerebral crește semnificativ. Această presiune ridicată ar putea fi cauzată de placa excesivă pe interiorul pereților arterelor, ceea ce face ca aceste artere să fie mai mici. Gândiți-vă la instalații sanitare. Când conductele care transportă lichidul devin mai mici, presiunea aceluiași volum de fluid exercită crește. Ce se întâmplă dacă tensiunea arterială devine prea mare? Voi răspunde la această întrebare cu încă una. Ce se întâmplă dacă presiunea apei din conductele casei dvs. devine prea mare? Țevile dvs. explodează. Același lucru aici. Dacă tensiunea arterială devine prea mare, arterele tale au o șansă mai mare de a exploda. Dacă există prea mult gunk în interiorul țevilor (placă în interiorul arterelor), acea minge de gunk ar putea deveni prea mare și ar putea bloca țevile! Pare rău și mie! Mai ales dacă arterele alea sunt în creierul tău, sau în inima ta, nu e ca rinichii, unde ai doi! Ai o scurgere în acele organe, şi familia ta primeşte în sfârşit acel salariu mare din poliţa de asigurare de viaţă! Nu e cel mai bun mod de a fi plătit, dacă nu cumva eşti un nemernic şi toată familia te urăşte!<br/>- Tensiunea arterială este măsurată în milimetri de mercur. Pentru referință, 1 psi (lire pe inch pătrat) este egal cu 51.7149326 milimetri de mercur. Dacă ați sângera și ați vrut să opriți pierderea de sânge cu presiune directă, și ar trebui, ar trebui să utilizați doar aproximativ 3 psi pentru ao opri. Dacă nu au tensiune arterială foarte mare, atunci poate 4 psi. Matematica de bază salvează ziua din nou!<br/>Primul experiment cunoscut pentru măsurarea presiunii exacte a sângelui a fost efectuat de Stephen Hales la 1 decembrie 1733. El a atașat un tub la artera crură stângă, apoi i-a permis sângelui să se grăbească prin tub și să crească la o înălțime de 8'3". El a remarcat că "când era la înălțimea sa completă, se va ridica și va cădea la și după fiecare puls 2, 3, sau 4 inci". Da, calul a sângerat, dar nu credeți că domnul Hales a fost prea crud, a efectuat experimentul pe un cal care era pe cale să fie pus jos oricum! Pentru cal, sunt sigur că această distincție nu a contat prea mult, desigur. 🙂<br/>*Avertisment legal: În timp ce sunt un profesionist medical, acest articol conține informații generale despre afecțiunile și tratamentele medicale.

Acolo, m-am acoperit.<br/>Împărtășiți cunoașterea!<br/>De fiecare dată când mănânc clătite (chips-uri dacă locuiți în SUA) care au o cantitate destul de mare de sare, tensiunea arterială crește semnificativ în următoarele câteva zile.<br/>Am încercat să obțin clătite fără sare în urmă cu aproximativ o săptămână și am adăugat propriul meu "lo-sare" (un înlocuitor de sare constând din clorură de potasiu și clorură de sodiu (sare), dar de două ori mai mult decât primul decât ultimul).<br/>Oricum, chips-urile cu aromă de sare nu-mi cresc deloc tensiunea.<br/>OK Știu că sunt necesare experimente suplimentare pe mine. Dar în acest moment suspectez puternic sarea ca vinovat. De asemenea, suspectez că zahărul îmi crește și PA. Dar sunt necesare multe investigații pentru a stabili acest lucru!<br/>Poate că ai un echilibru slab între potasiu şi sodiu. Mama mea are hipertensiune arterială şi era pe o dietă săracă în sodiu, dar nu primea suficient potasiu şi tensiunea arterială nu era stabilă. Dacă sunteți îngrijorat, este posibil să doriți să vă verificați nivelul de potasiu din sânge.<br/>Acum că consumă suficient potasiu, tensiunea arterială a fost normală de peste un an în timp ce consuma sodiu în intervale normale (mai mult de 2500 mg).<br/>Nu e vorba de sodiu... este grăsimea și amidonul care te face mai gras și mai gras; și că, este creșterea masei corporale și de a face mai greu pentru inima ta pentru a pompa sânge prin vene și artere, care sunt zdrobite în corpul tau de cantitatea crescută de grăsime acumulată.<br/>mâncați amidon pur sângeros și arătați spre sare în loc de zahăr, orice pentru a evita incriminarea zahărului nu prea menționați uleiul vegetal care crește toate cauzele de deces. Obțineți mult mai multă osmolalitate din zahăr<br/>Este nevoie de dovezi dure? Nu este un mit și foarte ușor de documentat — necesită puțină inteligență sau pregătire, oricine o poate face. La vârsta de 52-54 de ani, acest lucru a fost peste o perioadă de doi ani (2005 și 2006). Am folosit un program software (Diet Power 4 - am plătit 50 de dolari pentru el, dar acum este gratuit pentru descărcare) pentru a urmări timpul de exerciții alimentare, sodiu și biciclete. Graficele produse folosind metoda stiloului și hârtiei, deși vor face același lucru fiind că programul nu a avut prevederi pentru introducerea datelor privind tensiunea arterială. Un medic care ia o lectură la fiecare trei până la șase luni este absolut fără valoare, în opinia mea, dacă nu se face un efort de a lua lectură în circumstanțe identice, altele decât să arate o tendință generală de-a lungul mai multor ani.<br/>Am constatat că pentru a fi de orice valoare, pentru tipul meu de graf și ipoteza (acum dovedită), a fost necesar să se ia mai multe citiri pe o perioadă de cel puțin cinci minute sau până la două lecturi de închidere (trei sau mai puțin răspândire numerică și nu mai mult de trei bpm pe ritmul cardiac). Aș lua notă de citiri după o plimbare de două mile sau o oră de mers pe bicicletă într-un ritm lent până la moderat. Leagăne largi peste cinci minute a renunțat după ce am intrat în formă fizică și a rămas pe dieta. Site-urile profesionale recomandă să stați 3 minute sau mai mult și să luați mai mult de o lectură, dar am avut doar unul sau doi medici în ultimii douăzeci de ani care fac acest lucru, unii peste nevoia de a vedea rapid un alt pacient. O asistentă medicală a susținut că motivul semnificativ pentru care au fost luate măsurătorile tensiunii arteriale au fost companiile de asigurări care insistă asupra acestui lucru. Ea a susținut că unii medici nu s-au uitat la citirile pe care le-a făcut, așa că cine îi pasă dacă a fost făcut un efort pentru a obține o lectură corectă a fost concluzia ei.<br/>Mergeți după ce vă grăbiți să vă prezentați la timp, urcați scările sau orice altceva, stați jos, o asistentă vă apucă brațul și vă ia tensiunea arterială. La un moment dat am convins un medic să ia o a doua lectură după zece minute de discuții cu mine despre problemele mele medicale. El a susținut că a așteptat rar, un om cu 15 ani de experiență, deși site-urile profesionale recomandau să aștepte trei minute. Un alt medic a susținut că nu a auzit niciodată de Na care afectează tensiunea arterială (el a fost un medic al armatei cu diferite standarde de educație pe care le-a pretins).<br/>Graficele au fost frumoase și au arătat o coaliție perfectă între cei cinci factori introduși: tipul de hrană, cantitățile de sodiu, exercițiile fizice, frecvența cardiacă, greutatea.<br/>Am fost pe medicina tensiunii arteriale timp de zece ani, cu doar o schimbare numerică de 5. Am fost, de asemenea, în muncă sedentară și a primit zero exercițiu. Greutatea mea a fost la capătul superior al greutății normale sau ușor supraponderale. Aș mânca cantități tipice de sodiu pentru americani (2.000 + mg) timp de două zile. Apoi, diferite cantități de sodiu scăzut timp de 4 zile, apoi cresc treptat pe o perioadă de câteva zile. După 72 de ore de dietă cu conținut scăzut de sodiu și program de exerciții fizice, tensiunea arterială ar scădea semnificativ. 135/90 până la 110/70 timp de trei zile a fost tipic după ce am fost pe planul meu de dietă (dieta DASH) timp de o lună. Nivelurile de zahăr și alimentele chimice ridicate au fost, de asemenea, înregistrate ca parte a dietei. Aportul de sodiu a arătat mai mult decât alte exerciții fizice ca cea mai mare variabilă. Alimentele chimice ridicate au arătat, de asemenea, o diferență, deși alimentele chimice ridicate au adesea niveluri ridicate de sodiu.<br/>După patru zile de la reluarea dietei DASH, va exista o schimbare semnificativă și treptată în partea superioară. Este nevoie de două sau mai multe zile, în funcție de activitatea fizică și consumul de apă pentru a disipa sodiul din sânge este ipoteza mea, deși nu am confirmat niciodată acest lucru din cercetare.<br/>Bănuiesc că nivelurile de sodiu pentru o tensiune arterială adecvată variază între oameni și diferite modele de corp (gen, rasă, activitate, grăsime vs slabă, nivel de exerciții fizice, etc). Mulți oameni pot avea puțin sau niciun efect de la un 2,000 mg vs 600 mg de Na. Nu sunt unul dintre ei. Se estimează că oamenii din peșteri au avut o dietă de 400 până la 600 mg Na. Ceea ce a fost suficient de bun pentru oamenii din peșteri (care au avut o viață scurtă din alte motive) a fost suficient de bun pentru mine.<br/>A trebuit să fac un efort pentru a rămâne la 600 mg din cauza dietei mele. Dieta pe care am fost pe a fost 200 până la 400 mg dacă nu m-am forțat să folosesc acel shaker de sare). Sodiul este o parte necesară a dietei tale. Am găsit că cantitățile de Na peste 1000 mg au fost prea mult pentru corpul meu. Am hipertensiune arterială și palpitații cardiace cu dificultăți de respirație. Lecturile de laborator ale tiroidei au devenit perfecte și medicul mi-a luat medicamente pentru tiroidă și medicamente pentru tensiune arterială. Paliația inimii mele și scurtarea respirației la 3 până la 5 a.m. în fiecare noapte a renunțat după o lună. Toate problemele mele au reluat în mod semnificativ atunci când am ieșit din planul meu de dietă / exercițiu în ultimii ani. Un medic mai în vârstă, care a fost în profesie timp de patruzeci de ani, a susținut că am fost doar unul dintre cei doi oameni care au trecut de la un nivel de TSH de 0,0 la 4,0 (intervalul superior al normalului) după ce am renunțat la medicament. Problemele tiroidiene au reluat împreună cu tensiunea arterială, inima și paliația inimii. Am reluat acum dieta și planul de exerciții fizice și urmărirea. Voi trimite o actualizare după trei luni.<br/>Sunt doar o singură persoană, aşa că puneţi 400 de oameni pe acelaşi program şi vedeţi ce se întâmplă. Problema, desigur, este să găsiţi 200 de oameni cinstiţi din cei 400 care nu se încadrează în baza de date despre dietă şi exerciţii fizice sau ghiciţi. De asemenea, este nevoie de putere de voință pentru a rămâne la un program. Am rămas cu el timp de zece ani, apoi am renunțat din diverse motive. Scoateți-i din baza de date care nu arată nicio îmbunătățire care refuză să jure sub jurământ și să ia un test de detector de minciuni!<br/>Sarea (sodiu) crește tensiunea arterială. Am mers la medic și tensiunea arterială a fost 130/90. Ea mi-a spus să-mi controlez sarea (limita de sodiu 1500mg) și am avut un control două zile mai târziu cu tensiunea arterială 108/87. Ori de câte ori mănânc o mulțime de alimente sărate, am un vârf în presiunea mea. Sunt cu siguranță sensibil la sare.<br/>SAREA (SODIU) afectează tensiunea arterială. Trebuie să fiți atenți (se strecoară pe tine bine) și ajustați dieta pentru a limita aportul de sodiu și urmăriți semnele creșterii tensiunii arteriale. Mai ales atunci când se schimbă comportamentul corpului.<br/>Dacă sunteți leneș sau nu atât de activ, luați 30 de minute de mers pe jos 5 zile pe săptămână (150 de minute în total) minim pentru a obține un exercițiu decent.<br/>Cred că ideea este că recomandarea unei diete cu conținut scăzut de sodiu, care poate afectează un anumit grup de oameni, cei care au deja hipertensiune arterială și sunt sensibili la sare, la o întreagă populație este ridicolă. Un alt punct este dacă aportul ridicat de sare duce la probleme cardiovasculare cronice, care este promovată ca un fapt pentru public, dar nu are nici o cercetare pentru a o susține. Consum mult mai mult sodiu decât recomandă CDC și BP mea nu a fost niciodată mai mare decât 117/70, cel mai mare vreodată, normal aproximativ 100-110/65-70. Nici unul dintre cazurile noastre dovedesc într-un fel sau altul efectele "high" aportul de sodiu are asupra populației generale.<br/>S-ar putea să aveți potasiu celular scăzut, cupru ridicat, vitamina k2, magneziu scăzut, vitamina E scăzută, toxicitate a metalelor grele, cum ar fi plumbul, toată lumea este expusă la plumb și fluor, aceste lucruri se compun reciproc.<br/>Uitați-vă la condițiile care vă determină să aveți această sensibilitate la sare, cum ar fi cortizolul scăzut de potasiu.<br/>Nu vă odihniți doar pe sare, deoarece probabil veți avea mai multe probleme, precum și aproape nimeni nu mănâncă doar sare de la sine.<br/>Sarea se găsește, în general, în alimentele bogate în zahăr simplu, fără fibre, cu aditivi.<br/>Înțelegeți instrucțiunile sunt pentru întreaga populație nu numai pentru tine, acest lucru este problematic, deoarece sarea nerafinată nu se dovedește a fi nesănătoasă pentru majoritatea oamenilor și pentru unii îmbunătățește sănătatea și în a face aceste instrucțiuni fără recunoașterea individualității biochimice.<br/>Înțelegerea reducerii BP nu este totul, acest lucru a fost făcut mecanic de medicamente în studii care nu arată nicio îmbunătățire a rezultatelor și chiar agravarea simptomelor în afara semnului măsurării BP.<br/>Lucruri de luat în considerare, extract de frunze de măsline, vitamina e, vitamina c, vitamina k2, potasiu, curcumină, stevia (îndulcitorul natural), magneziu, pomegranit, l-arginină, nattokinază, ulei de pește, cacao, sfeclă, acid alfa lipoic, bromelaină, semințe de in, țelină, coq10, semințe de in, hawthorne. Toate acestea îmbunătățesc BP și problemele cardiovasculare. Ai mult mai mult în setul de instrumente decât crezi<br/>În ceea ce privește zahărul, femeile ar trebui să-și limiteze zahărul (carbohidrații totali sunt ceea ce contează și să aibă grijă de anumiți alcooli de zahăr) 20g-30g o gustare și 30g-45g fiecare masă. Bărbații ar trebui să-și păstreze gustările la fel ca femeile 20g-30g o gustare și 60g – 75g o masă. Cele mai mici numere sunt limita pentru diabetici, desigur.<br/>Cred că unii oameni au o sensibilitate la sodiu. Sunt convins că o fac. După ce am luat 3 medicamente BP diferite la un moment dat și încă mai am hipertensiune necontrolată, am început să citesc etichetele alimentelor și să-mi reduc drastic aportul de sodiu. Cele mai multe alimente procesate sunt încărcate cu sodiu. Am reușit să opresc complet 2 medicamente și să reduc a treia la 1/4 din doza prescrisă. Pentru mine, reducerea sodiului a făcut o diferență uriașă. Noaptea trecută am luat 10 mg de lisinopril, care este 1/4 din doza zilnică prescrisă. Astăzi, BP-ul meu este prea scăzut, 105/48. Chiar trebuie să-l monitorizez în mod constant, deoarece BP scăzut nu este prea distractiv, fie.<br/>Medicamentele pentru tensiune arterială sunt ineficiente, ele nu reușesc să îmbunătățească rezultatele doar citirea BP.<br/>Ați redus aportul de alimente nedorite cu conținut scăzut de potasiu, sare, zahăr, fibre, acest lucru a fost întotdeauna de gând să scadă tensiunea arterială.<br/>Sarea nu este dușmanul pe care îl ai nevoie doar de potasiu și antioxidanți pentru a-l echilibra și a reduce stresul.<br/>Când oamenii reduc sodiul în acest fel, nu puteți contribui la sare în sine, ați modificat complet aportul alimentar de multe lucruri, în acest fel oamenii pot fi păcăliți să creadă că este un singur lucru.<br/>Această atribuire a unei cauze singulare la probleme se face în mod constant în ipoteze și acestea tind să fie complet fals demoniza lucruri singulare, cum ar fi Co2, sare, grăsimi saturate, colesterol, lipsa de seratonină, chiar lipsa de utilizarea de fluoruri otrăvitoare.<br/>Acestea sunt toate miturile care eșuează sub control, dar continuă să fie susținute ca cauze prin reglementarea organismelor prin cules de cireșe și respingerea minimizării contradicțiilor copleșitoare. Companiile farmaceutice de junk food și ulei vegetal beneficiază și dezinformează publicul pentru profitul pe care rachetele FDA îl fac pentru a-și omorî concurența.<br/>Cercetarea în medicină și multe alte cercetări sunt o groapă de amăgire incestuoasă între interesul privat și stimularea economiei, precum și medicii politici și profitul guvernamental.<br/>Editorii studiilor publicate în reviste au constatat că majoritatea studiilor lipsesc în totalitate, concluziile care trebuie trase spre o prejudecată de confirmare și că suntem într-o epocă destul de întunecată pentru știință în care credința, consensul și evaluarea inter pares sunt mai puțin despre știință bună și mai mult despre convingerile și dovezile concurente care vor afecta profiturile și granturile viitoare.<br/>Da, orice. Crede ce vrei. Am citit cărți de sănătate de ani de zile..DECENI...și am citit în ele EXACT ceea ce este tipărit în acest articol. NICIODATĂ nu a existat o legătură dovedită între sare și hipertensiune arterială. Mai mult decât atât, într-una dintre cărți a subliniat că sarea este folosită pentru a face acid gastric și este ironic faptul că, pe măsură ce îmbătrânim, dieta cu conținut scăzut de sodiu atât de des promovată duce la probleme digestive.<br/>Continuați să credeți medicii care iau 3 credite de nutriție în colegiu și compuși care provoacă efecte secundare mai grave decât boala reală.<br/>Doctorii, care spun că chiropractica nu e un medicament adevărat, citeşte ziarele Winsdor. Un medic care a încercat să-l demonstreze pe Chiro că este fals făcând autopsii a constatat că 99 din 100 de insuficiențe ale organelor au fost cauzate de lipsa energiei nervoase cauzată de "subluxații" care prind nervii și întrerup fluxul de energie nervoasă. (Nu sunt un chiropractician).<br/>Mergeți să citiți cărți de Norman Walker, (în special "Fructe și legume proaspete."), TC Fry, și Herbert M. Shelton (Nutriție superioară, Postul vă poate salva viața). Le-am citit pe toate.<br/>Acesta este un articol excelent și sunt de fapt surprins să văd adevărul atât de deschis postat într-un articol ca acesta ... dar crezi ceea ce vrei și ia substanțe chimice împinse de profesia medicală ... mănâncă ceea ce vrei, bea ceea ce vrei, nu exercita și atunci când lucrurile merg prost doar ia o pastilă....<br/>Am încercat să caut aceste "Winsdor Papers" și chiar Google nu știe despre ce vorbești. Dacă vrei cu adevărat să câștigi oameni, ar trebui să postezi link-uri la informațiile pe care vrei să le citim.<br/>Băieți, vă lipsește un singur punct: sodiul este otrăvitor pentru noi. Chiar dacă nu crește BP, otrava sa încă; / nu este deloc bună<br/>@Marco: Ai muri instantaneu fără sodiu în corpul tău.<br/>Nu sunt acelaşi Marco ca dl. "Sarea e otravă".<br/>Desigur – totul în exces este rău – heck, chiar și consumul de prea multă apă te va ucide.<br/>Acum, fiecare persoană este diferită, așa că trebuie să găsești ceea ce funcționează pentru tine. A mea, îmi place sărat 🙂<br/>Acest articol este înșelător. Doar pentru că efectul negativ al sarii asupra tensiunii arteriale este o "teorie" nu înseamnă că ar trebui să o ignorăm. De fapt, cea mai mare parte a medicinei și științei se desfășoară pe teorii plauzibile. Adevărul este că o dietă cu conținut scăzut de sare este mai puțin dăunătoare decât o dietă cu conținut ridicat de sare și, ca toate lucrurile, morala reală a poveștii este moderația. De asemenea, acest autor se contrazice spunând că nu există "nici o dovadă ... Da, niciunul" pentru a susține această teorie, dar apoi continuă să citeze cel puțin un studiu care arată corolația negativă la oameni și un altul care implică șobolani. Aceasta este o dovadă, cel puțin unele nu deloc. Cea mai mare parte a medicinei este magie neagră și mulți medici vor admite asta. Sigur, uneori suntem departe de a ști, dar în acest caz există suficientă știință în spatele impactului sărurilor asupra BP pentru a face să merite luate în considerare. Amintiți-vă, de asemenea, consumul uman de cantități mari de sare este un lucru destul de nou pe scara evolutivă, deci impactul său asupra corpului nostru este destul de nenatural.<br/>@Mike: "Nicio dovadă... Da, niciuna" Cred că Scott înseamnă "Nicio dovadă de renume" sau, mai degrabă, "Nicio dovadă care nu este defectuoasă".<br/>"Totul cu moderatie" Da, exact. Asa cum ii place lui Scott sa spuna, "Chiar si apa te va ucide in doze destul de mari." Mi-a spus chiar şi o dată povestea unei femei pe care a încercat să o trateze pentru acest lucru – a băut cantităţi masive de apă şi a sfârşit prin a muri din cauza ei.<br/>"Cea mai mare parte a medicinei este magie neagră și mulți doctori vor recunoaște asta." Nu cred că vreun doctor ar spune vreodată asta. Poate că acum un secol sau două. Dar există o cantitate uimitoare de știință bună implicată aici în aceste zile. Suntem departe de a ști totul, dar cu siguranță nu este magie neagră sau doar ghici munca, așa cum se pare că implică.<br/>Îmi pare rău să nu fiu de acord cu tine Dave. Dar chiar și pe sursele videoclipului, creșterea tensiunii arteriale pe dietele bogate în sare este evidentă. În timp ce la sfârșitul uneia dintre ele, în timp ce vorbim despre companiile de băuturi răcoritoare și gustări:<br/>Unele dintre aceste companii au fost proeminente în încercarea de a crea o controversă artificială care să îndoiască relația dintre aportul de sare și tensiunea arterială, probabil în speranța de a opri sau încetini orice reducere a aportului de sare a populației pentru a proteja vânzările de băuturi răcoritoare.<br/>Chiar și așa, nu sunt un specialist în domeniu, lipsa unei revizuiri a literaturii în sursă despre această chestiune este deranjantă.<br/>Dietele care sunt alimente procesate cu aditivi cu conținut scăzut de grăsimi, cu conținut ridicat de zahăr, studiile observaționale sunt lipsite de sens, acești oameni mănâncă cantități copioase de zahăr în fiecare an. Dacă credeți că corporațiile încearcă să li se permită să folosească mai multă sare distragerea sa ridicolă în a face orice să nu se uite la epidemia sindromului metabolismului zahărului.<br/>Cât de ridicol crezi că studiile observaționale contează pentru altceva decât să propui o ipoteză, apoi folosești intervenția și studiile placebo dublu-orb fără variabile pentru a le dovedi cauzale. Acest lucru nu se face, de asemenea, nu se face pentru colesterol sau grăsimi saturate. Ești o victimă naivă a științei patologice, când spune că nu există dovezi, nu există dovezi că studiile observaționale nu controlează nimic, nu sunt un experiment, nu așa funcționează știința. Înțelegeți că cochrane sunt probabil cel mai neutru grup de studiu clinic din lume și au revizuit 150 de studii și 13 studii populaționale. Aici spuneți că constatările lor sunt greșite pe baza a ce? nimic altceva decât credința ta bazată pe o ipoteză fără dovezi.<br/>Vă sugerez să citiți cartea "Sare". Este în cea mai mare parte o relatare istorică geopolitică a sarii în civilizația noastră, dar are, de asemenea, o bună parte de știință în ea. Am construit civilizația noastră pe sare.<br/>Primul paragraf spune: „Înțelegeți că este doar o teorie și una care nu este susținută de multe dovezi științifice solide”, cred că, deoarece acesta este un site web cu minte științifică, nu ar trebui să folosească teoria cuvântului în acest context, deoarece în știință, o teorie este o explicație acceptată a unui fenomen, dovedită prin testare.<br/>Da, ar fi trebuit să folosească ipoteza. Va trebui să mă uit la istoria teoriei şi să văd dacă ştie cineva cum a ajuns la două sensuri atât de diferite.<br/>Pentru un profesionist medical (care duce la o presupunere a educației avansate), aveți o înțelegere oribilă a gramaticii și a ortografiei. Acest lucru discreditează o mare parte din ceea ce spuneți, în mintea mea. Faptul că altcineva vă revizuiește munca înainte de publicare ar merge mult.<br/>Voi continua să-mi ascult cardiologul pe această temă și să-mi limitez aportul de sare.<br/>@Mark: Ceva ce veți găsi aparent adevărat despre un număr mare de profesioniști medicali, stereotipul scrierii lor de mână fiind oribil este în general corect. (Scott este deosebit de rău.) Și scrierea lor tehnică poate fi, de asemenea, uneori, deosebit de teribilă, pre-editată. (Ei studiază medicina și corpul uman, nu scriu, la urma urmei) Dar, în peste 100 de articole pe care Scott le-a scris, nu s-a dovedit niciodată că greșește pe un punct principal (și doar câteva cazuri de a fi greșit pe un punct minor). Veți găsi întotdeauna cel puțin unul dintre acestea în fiecare dintre articolele sale, în ciuda eforturilor mele cele mai sincere de a scăpa de toate. Dar, în cele din urmă, îmi pasă de precizie mult mai mult decât de gramatică. Ambele ar fi bune, dar găsirea unui scriitor al expertizei speciale a lui Scott și a capacității de a gândi critic și de a procesa cantități uriașe de cunoștințe medicale este extrem de dificilă. Acești oameni nu sunt un ban o duzină. 🙂<br/>Dar într-adevăr, puterea argumentelor lui Scott nu se bazează niciodată pe cunoştinţele sale medicale extinse. Acest lucru îl ajută doar să examineze temeinic diferitele studii pe acest subiect, unde majoritatea s-ar pierde în terminologie, să nu mai vorbim să poată gândi critic despre ele și metodologia lor. Punctul forte al argumentului sunt studiile în sine. În aceasta, ar fi bine să citiți de fapt cele două recenzii Cochrane și, probabil, să le transmiteți cardiologului dvs. pentru gândurile sale.<br/>Nu fi surprins dacă el/ea le-a pregătit deja și poate chiar este de acord cu ele. Ceea ce medicii le spun pacienților lor nu se aliniază întotdeauna cu ceea ce știu sau cred că este adevărat. Mai ales în cazuri ca aceasta, în cazul în care procesele pot fi o posibilitate foarte reală, dacă ei ți-au spus să mănânci toată sarea pe care doriți, atunci ai murit de o problemă de inimă (dar nu au nimic de-a face cu sarea), apoi familia ta le dă în judecată și citează ceea ce diferite agenții guvernamentale spun despre acest subiect, mai degrabă decât ceea ce lumea medicală gândește de fapt. 🙂 Privirea sodiului nu este susceptibilă să rănească, dar acoperă partea din spate a cardiologilor. (De fapt, am avut o discuție interesantă despre acest lucru cu Scott aseară despre un medic cu care discuta despre acest lucru, care a spus ceva foarte similar cu privire la motivul pentru care, în ciuda faptului că știe că sodiul nu va fi dăunător în acest fel, el spune încă unora dintre pacienții săi să urmărească aportul lor de sodiu.)<br/>În cele din urmă, așa cum spun mereu, "Întrebați totul", dar și atunci când puneți întrebări, faceți cercetarea pentru a găsi și răspunsurile, apoi verificați de două ori cercetarea doar pentru a vă asigura. 🙂 Și, poate că nu faceți greșeala de a echilibra gramatica și capacitatea de scriere cu cunoașterea unui subiect sau a inteligenței. Am lucrat cu o tonă de scriitori. Pot spune, jurnaliștii (și alți astfel de oameni cu un fundal de scriere) sunt grozavi la scris... Aproape toate sunt oribile la cercetare, ceea ce m-a surprins la jurnaliști, dar poate explică multe despre starea rapoartelor mass-media despre studiile științifice. Destul de amuzant, cel mai bun combo de scriere și de cercetare pare a fi avocați. Sunt fenomenale la ambele în experiența mea. Oamenii de știință tind să fie săraci în scris, dar incredibili în cercetare și gândire critică. Desigur, asta se întâmplă doar cu câteva zeci de scriitori cu care am lucrat, și există o excepție pe care am găsit-o, dar este o tendință pe care am observat-o.<br/>Cred că toată lumea trebuie să fie diferită. Pentru mine sarea îmi ridică tensiunea arterială foarte mult. Verific bl pr 4-6x pe zi. Rămâne suficient de scăzută atunci când stau sub 300 mg de sare. De îndată ce mănânc o mulțime de sare, cum ar fi mâncarea chinezească sau chiar un sub de carne și brânză sau două felii de pizza bl pr merge la 170/98. Este nevoie de câteva zile pentru a obține sarea din corpul meu. Apoi va coborî la 130/80 și uneori un pic mai jos. Am 67 de ani.<br/>tocmai ați oferit lucruri care conțin cantități mari de carbohidrați simpli, care conțin și grâu. Zaharul are osmolalitate ridicată, dar este ignorat datorită greutății aplicate sarii<br/>Numai eliminarea grâului dietetic poate scădea bp cu 20-40 mmHG. Prelungirea vieții companiei spune că acest lucru optimizează și profilurile lipidelor din sânge.<br/>Vedeţi cum vă bazaţi probabil pe presupuneri, pe ceea ce vi s-a spus, pe ipoteza care nu are dovezi?<br/>Problemele cardiovasculare în studiile observaționale au găsit o corelație cu oamenii care mănâncă cantitatea foarte mare de 5 grame de sare pe zi, vă puteți imagina ce cantitate de junk food mănâncă pentru a atinge această cantitate.<br/>Dacă problema dvs. este sare, aveți o afecțiune de bază care o provoacă, deoarece nu obțineți o cantitate mare în nici un fel, dar ignorați și alte cauze, care este problema atunci când lucrurile singulare sunt promovate ca principalul factor care contribuie atunci când nici o dovadă nu sugerează că acestea sunt cauza.<br/>Luați în considerare potasiul celular, cuprul, expunerea la plumb, magneziu, aportul de vitamina E, nivelurile de coq10, iritanții și stresul care pot crește coagularea și constricția vaselor.<br/>Dacă pot să comentez întreaga controversă ortografică / gramatică ... în experiența mea de observare a oamenilor, populația (cel puțin cei inteligenți, întreaga mea familie are un IQ ridicat și soțul meu este un geniu, literalmente, și cum nu am prieteni de inteligență inferioară pentru un grup de control, pot vorbi doar din observațiile mele despre familia mea și familia soțului meu) este împărțită în două tipuri: cuvinte-oa-opopopopopopo. Tatăl meu a fost o persoană matematică, așa cum am fost eu când eram foarte mic, totuși, am trăit cu mama mea, care este cu siguranță o persoană de cuvinte, toată viața mea, ceea ce a condus la dezvoltarea mea într-o persoană de cuvinte. Soţul meu poate fi cea mai deşteaptă persoană pe care am întâlnit-o, dar din ortografia, gramatica şi vocabularul lui, nu vei şti niciodată. El este un tehnician de reparații de calculator, poate repara orice, extrem de versatil în abilitățile sale de muncă, poate rezolva probleme de algebră cu care mă lupt minute la un moment dat cu doar o privire, dar nu poate scrie numele fiului nostru.<br/>Din câte îmi dau seama, oamenii de știință tind să fie oameni de matematică mai mult decât oameni de cuvânt. (Pentru înregistrare, una dintre slujbele mele anterioare a fost cercetarea, iar eu sunt o gramatică nazistă și sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>Mă întrebam dacă aş putea să-i cer autorului acestui articol o mică favoare.<br/>La început am citit această propoziție în ceea ce privește aportul de sare:<br/>"Dar voi acoperi teoria despre motivul pentru care sarea ridică tensiunea arterială sub - doar realizați [este doar o teorie] și una care nu este susținută de o mare parte din dovezile științifice dure ..."<br/>Aici utilizați "Teorie" în expresia sa populară. Care este bine și totul. Problema este că acesta este un articol științific și când o teorie nu este susținută de dovezi, o numim "Ipoteză".<br/>Aceia dintre noi care scriu în domeniul științific ar trebui să facă un efort pentru a face această distincție, mai ales pentru că data viitoare când voi primi un tânăr creaționist al Pământului spunându-mi că evoluția este "doar o teorie", jur că voi începe să sari în sus și în jos ca un cimpanzeu și să fac sammerault înapoi. Apoi voi arunca fecale la el / ea.<br/>Sunt sigur că nu vrei ca o astfel de scenă să devină realitate.<br/>Așadar, să începem o campanie pentru a numi o teorie „un grup coerent de propoziții generale testate, considerate în mod obișnuit drept corecte, care pot fi folosite ca principii de explicare și predicție pentru o clasă de fenomene” și să numim orice lucru care este menit să fie tras din orificiul din spate al unei persoane o „ipoteză”.<br/>BTW: Știu că dicționarul returnează ambele sensuri. Pentru binele Științei, să schimbăm sensul înapoi, deoarece avem deja un cuvânt bun pentru "Tocmai mi-am scos asta din fund".<br/>@Marco: Acesta este un punct bun. Voi începe să lucrez la această distincție în articolele viitoare. 🙂<br/>Nu se poate trage o singură concluzie legitimă dintr-o singură măsurare a tensiunii arteriale. BP variază foarte mult chiar și de la un moment la altul. Am văzut de multe ori o scădere de 160/100 la 130/75 în decurs de câteva minute. De asemenea, echipamentul de măsurare BP este foarte variabil și susceptibil la variații mari de la lucruri cum ar fi dimensiunea manșetei și variațiile utilizatorului.<br/>Orice concluzie trasa din cateva masuratori nu este altceva decat speculatie si wishful thinking.<br/>În primul rând, acesta nu este un articol de revistă revizuit de colegi. Sunt de acord, utilizarea corectă a "teoriei" a fost ofuscată de versiunea colocvială "doar o bănuială". Dar, să mergem mai departe, bine?<br/>Nu înțeleg că articolul este în cel mai puțin înșelător. Înțeleg că autorul face punctul că aparent este pierdut pe mulți — "După cum am spus, în prezent nu există dovezi solide că sarea vă va crește cronic tensiunea arterială. Da, niciunul".<br/>El menționează, de asemenea, să gândească critic. Deci, dacă nu-l crezi, a) continua cu credința ta, sau b) afla pentru tine. Fă munca în picioare. Citiți articolele. Acum aveți un punct de plecare. Mulțumesc pentru asta.<br/>În opinia mea, concentrarea pe eroarea gramaticală ocazională sau dezbaterea "teorie vs. intuiție" diminuează inutil intenția autorului. Concluzia mea este că acest articol ajută la contestarea ipotezelor mele despre ceea ce am crezut că a fost deja concluzionat științific. Am învăţat ceva, asta e ideea.<br/>@Michael Stelly Nu sunt sigur dacă v-ați referit în mod specific la postarea mea în ceea ce privește utilizarea "teorie", dar vă asigur că comentariul meu nu a fost destinat să critice scriitorul deloc. Cel puțin nu în aceiași termeni ca o "greșeală" gramaticală sau ortografică.<br/>Comentariul meu nu este despre o "eroare", ci este o sugestie ca aceia dintre noi care citesc și scriu despre știință să facă partea noastră pentru a revendica utilizarea cuvântului "teorie" din mainstream sau că cel puțin încercăm.<br/>Există cei care comentează erori evidente de ortografie și sunt de acord că nu sunt importante în contextul informațiilor furnizate în articol (deși sunt de acord că pot distrage atenția și vorbesc de la un vorbitor nativ al limbii engleze), dar dacă numărul și caracterul lor nu sunt de așa natură încât să facă înțelegerea articolului dificilă sau chiar imposibilă, nu mă veți găsi postând despre ei.<br/>Cuvântul „teorie”, pe de altă parte, este un cuvânt care este folosit în mod activ de anumite facțiuni ale discuțiilor științei / religiei pentru a reduce 200 de ani de progres științific și este folosit în mod activ pentru a înșela copiii în a reduce știința în ansamblu.<br/>Dacă ați urmărit dezbaterea Nye – Ham, Gawker a cerut unor creaționiști să scrie o întrebare susținătorilor evoluției pe o bucată de hârtie și au publicat aceste întrebări sub formă de imagini. Invariabil a apărut întrebarea "este doar o teorie".<br/>În acest spirit le-am cerut curatorilor acestui site să încerce să folosească cuvântul în sensul său ştiinţific. Dacă noi, în domeniul ştiinţei şi al tehnicii, nu facem asta, nu ne putem aştepta ca cei care vor să distorsioneze ştiinţa pentru obiectivele lor să o facă pe cont propriu.<br/>Deci, cu tot respectul, nu voi lua sfatul tău. Cu siguranță voi lăsa greșeli de ortografie stupide, dar acest lucru este important pentru mine și ar trebui să fie important pentru noi toți care iubim știința.<br/>nimeni nu denaturează știința mai mult decât evoluționiștii, deducerea și speculația bazată pe o ipoteză de fapt nu sunt dovezi. Niciun domeniu nu are atâtea farse și ipoteze ca evoluția.<br/>Continuând să se folosească argumentul contrast greșit și presupunerea că, deoarece creația trebuie să fie greșită, evoluția nu este adevărată, dovezile nu arată că macroevoluția este posibilă în acest moment în niciuna dintre multele teorii concurente actuale bazate exclusiv pe mutație și selecție naturală. Aș sugera că trebuie găsit un alt mecanism.<br/>Dovezile contradictorii sunt complet ignorate sau chiar revendicate ca dovezi ale unui proces mai complex, dar încă o dovadă a evoluției atunci când nu este un astfel de lucru în toate cazurile.<br/>În prezent avem dovezi pentru abiogeneză că este un fapt absolut, așa cum este microevoluția absolut corectă, totuși, în ceea ce privește macroevoluția, aș sugera că știința s-a întors să se bazeze pe dovezi, nu pe o ipoteză de fapt și pe denaturarea datelor pentru a-l induce să se potrivească prea bine teoriei.<br/>Așa cum evoluția nu este știință, este o credință foarte asemănătoare teoriei Big Bang, care are dovezi contradictorii masive că, în trecut, atunci când oamenii au folosit dovezi pentru a dovedi sau a infirma teoriile, această teorie ar fi fost arhivată, combinația acestor două teorii este asemănătoare unei religii, religia umaniștilor seculari. La fel de politice ca și comunitățile care susțin aceste credințe, ad hominem, nu pot sta pe dovezi, ci pe intimidare. Studiile arată că ad hominem este la fel de util ca argumentul rațional, acest lucru este folosit de știința iligitamată, cum ar fi alarmismul climatic bazat pe CO2 și macroevoluția, care în prezent nu au dovezi în favoarea lor, dar folosesc aceleași tipuri de propagandă și atacuri care sugerează că oricine se opune lor este anti-știință sau un cretin.<br/>Vă sugerez să citiți http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>Oamenii care nu sunt de acord cu evoluția nu cred în mod automat creația, evoluționistul atacă întotdeauna și distrage atenția de la propriul lor argument slab creează propriul lor om de paie din ceea ce alții cred și presupun pe baza propriilor lor presupuneri adesea moronice că sunt susținute de dovezi atunci când nu sunt.<br/>Un fapt pe care aș dori să-l adaug:<br/>Diureticele tiazidice și tiazidicele sunt o altă dovadă în această controversă. Interesant, tiazidele sunt numite diuretice, dar atunci când sunt luate zilnic acest efect diuretic devine aproape zero. După o perioadă de terapie cu tiazide cronice, beneficiul principal al acestor medicamente este că ele cresc eliminarea ionilor de sodiu și clorură din sânge prin simporterul Na/Cl în tubul contorsionat distal (împreună cu alte efecte, cum ar fi retenția de calciu). În ciuda pierderii efectului diuretic, tiazidele își păstrează efectele de scădere a tensiunii arteriale pe termen lung și sunt unul dintre medicamentele utilizate în prima linie pentru scăderea tensiunii arteriale. Acest efect de scădere este în general atribuit eliminării sodiului și pare să fie în concordanță cu ideea că nivelurile ridicate de sodiu cresc tensiunea arterială.<br/>Credeți sau nu. Sarea pare să-mi scadă tensiunea arterială. Dacă mănânc prea multe jetoane, de fapt, mă amețesc de la tensiunea arterială scăzută. Nu pot spune că o primesc.<br/>Această "teorie" este pur și simplu stupidă. Sarea crește tensiunea arterială mare! Este un fapt, observat, monitorizat. Mâncați din greșeală niște lucruri destul de sărate într-o zi decât a fost nevoie de o săptămână de diuretice pentru a scăpa de toată sarea din organism și pentru a aduce tensiunea arterială de la 190-200 (da, că mare a ajuns!!!) înapoi la normal (120-130). Aşa că nu spune poveşti care nu sunt adevărate.<br/>Nu toți oamenii răspund la fel la sare dietetică. Sugestia mea pentru noi este de a lua notă de nivelul de sodiu în rezultatele normale de laborator în minime fizice anuale.<br/>Încă din copilărie, sunt obișnuit să iau mai multă sare cu mesele mele, dar nu m-am confruntat niciodată cu problema BP ridicată, în schimb uneori merge sub normal. Am căutat pe Google această problemă și am ajuns la concluzia că corpul meu are nevoie de sare mai mult decât în mod normal pentru a compensa problema „BP scăzută” transmisă genetic. Deci? Creierul tău este instructorul pentru sănătatea ta. Trebuie să urmezi comenzile sale pentru a rămâne într-adevăr sănătos!<br/>Ei bine, eu sunt doar un nutriționist (cum ar fi o universitate de nutriție majoră care va absolvi în luna mai) și poate că ceea ce am învățat este taur, dar după ce m-am gândit la fiziopatologia modului în care sodiul poate afecta tensiunea arterială, găsesc că recomandarea are sens, dar ar trebui să faceți mai mult decât să reduceți sodiul. Un lucru care este important este raportul sodiu: potasiu (adică mâncați o grămadă de alimente procesate, cu adaos de sodiu în comparație cu fructele și legumele proaspete sau congelate). Recunosc că nu toată lumea este sensibilă la sare și că am decis în mod conștient, în domeniul sănătății, să presupunem că toată lumea este pentru că testarea sensibilității la sare (dacă acesta este un cuvânt!) este costisitoare, lungă și impracticabilă. Dar ideea că nu există dovezi plauzibile care să lege sarea de hipertensiune este falsă. Iată doar 6 articole. Acestea nu sunt cele pe care le-au dat profesorii noștri să le citească (deși dacă doriți să le găsesc pentru dvs., sunt sigur că pot), dar sunt bune și nu aveți nevoie de un cod universitar special sau de membru pentru a le accesa. Oricum, aici te duci în cazul în care doriți să citiți mai mult:<br/>Arată vreunul dintre aceștia că există o corelație fără alți factori? Spuneți "ar trebui să faceți mai mult decât să reduceți sodiul"... există dovezi că a face aceste alte acțiuni fără a reduce sodiul nu funcționează la fel de bine ca și tăierea sodiului?<br/>Nu ați citit? Cochrane a folosit 150 de studii și 13 studii corect? Deci, aveți 6, aceasta este "educația" dvs. la locul de muncă. Spălarea creierului și apoi confirmarea părtinitoare caută sprijin pentru ipoteza defectuoasă care s-a constatat că nu este deja de înaltă calitate.<br/>Dacă Cochrane nu l-a folosit, nu este un articol de înaltă calitate, dacă a făcut-o, atunci sprijinul nu a fost semnificativ în articol. Mecanismul osmolalității se aplică dietelor bogate în zahăr, dar totul este despre sare<br/>Problema aici este că studiile de calitate scăzută sunt publicate în mod constant că oamenii deduc cauzalitatea de unde nu pot face acest lucru, deoarece nu au controlat toate variabilele.<br/>Același lucru se face pentru ipoteza lipidelor și ipoteza colesterolului.<br/>Acestea sunt, de asemenea, mituri, colesterolul din toate datele este invers legat de bolile de inima usor.<br/>Reducerea absolută a riscului de boli de inimă este de 1,4%, acest lucru nu este semnificativ, efectele statinelor pentru scăderea problemelor cardiace la cei care au deja un atac de cord pot fi în întregime datorate efectului lor ca anticoagulant. Din nou, știința patologică a junk-ului este folosită pentru a împinge tratamentele fără a recunoaște mecanismele și variabilele. Cei mai mulți oameni vor fi afectați prin inhibarea vitaminei K coq10 și a sintezei colesterolului prin statine, dar medicii susținuți de lăcomia farmaceutică promovează oferirea acestora tuturor.<br/>Grăsimea saturată nu are nici un mecanism prin care să crească colesterolul, nici un studiu de înlocuire a grăsimilor pur înlocuite cu ulei în blinduri duble controlează toate variabilele și cu cât se apropie mai mult de acest lucru, cu atât mai rău rezultatele pentru intervenția PUFA devin creșterea tuturor cauzelor de deces.<br/>După cum se spune, studiile sunt de calitate scăzută, nu există prea multă voință de a răsturna ipoteza că organismele de reglementare și medicii au o credință religioasă în care nu este susținută de dovezi. Această dezinformare duce la sănătate slabă și profit farmaceutic.<br/>Am fost sfâșiat între a mânca mai multă sare sau nu, deoarece consumul de mai multă sare reduce ritmul cardiac și BP și mă face să dorm mai bine; mâinile și picioarele mele se simt pline și calde. Volumul meu de transpirație crește pe măsură ce merg cu bicicleta sau pe jos. Dar apoi, după ce l-am luat timp de o săptămână sau 2 apoi am observat că BP devine persistent ridicat; ceea ce mă face să simt că am făcut greșit prin mâncat. Ceea ce menționează acest articol este creșterea volumului de lichid, ceea ce este interesant. Înainte de a-mi crește aportul de sare, degetele mele se simt subțiri. Poate că după nivelurile de lichide se simt normal tăiate înapoi pe sare la niveluri normale. Deci, eu sunt doar ipoteza că oamenii care au sare sensibile au un volum de lichid bun și ar trebui să urmărească aportul de sare, alții pot lua sare, dar se opresc atunci când se simte plin.<br/>Bazându-mă pe auto-experimentare, cred că menținerea volumului de lichide este foarte importantă. Uneori, găsesc că mi-e sete și beau apă și că aceasta continuă să iasă; ceea ce necesită un aport de sare. Practic, nu mănânc conserve sau multe alimente rapide, aportul meu de sare este ceea ce se adaugă intenționat în gătit. După exercițiu, (mănâncă de carte și de a lucra afară provoacă probleme, de asemenea) observ că atunci când mă ridic din poziția de ședere, mă simt amețit, dar nu în mod normal. Cred că s-ar putea să transpir sare și , desigur, beau o mulțime de apă în timpul exercițiului. Nu propun să mâncați mai multă sare. Ceea ce spun este modul în care corpul vă spune că sarea este epuizată este atunci când nu vă simțiți plini în picioare și în mâini. Cred că acest lucru este corect într-o oarecare măsură, deoarece organismul lucrează mai mult la concentrarea lucrurilor decât la cantitățile absolute. Nu este o teorie cuprinzătoare, deoarece există alte lucruri care pot crește volumul sângelui, este posibil să aveți deja prea multă sare în sânge etc. Pentru înregistrare, sodiul meu din sânge este întotdeauna aproape de capătul inferior al intervalului, astfel încât eroarea mea nu mă va împinge în afara intervalului.<br/>Ok care este concluzia? folosesc sarea shaker acum sau nu? Am fost deținut prea mult timp.<br/>Cred că acest articol este iresponsabil, deoarece sarea crește absolut BP la cei care au o sensibilitate la sare. Dacă mănânc ceva foarte sărat, pot intra literalmente în criză hipertensivă într-o chestiune de oră.<br/>Acest tip de sensibilitate este comun și să nu o menționăm (pentru că nu se potrivește cu teoria autorilor?) este periculos.<br/>@Jim Porter: "pentru că nu se potrivește cu teoria autorilor?" "teoria autorului" nu există. Asta nu este cu adevărat ceea ce facem aici. Acesta este un articol care pur și simplu scrie despre studii științifice pe subiect și spune ceea ce spun, astfel încât să nu trebuie să le cerneți și tot jargonul medical; o facem pentru dvs. - în esență, ceea ce scriem reflectă starea actuală a cunoștințelor umane pe subiectul în cauză. Dacă se schimbă la un moment dat, actualizăm articolul. În acest caz, cu toate acestea, cele două recenzii Cochrane sunt destul de convingătoare: „După mai mult de 150 de studii clinice aleatorii și 13 studii populaționale fără și un semnal evident în favoarea reducerii sodiului, o altă poziție ar putea fi să accepte că un astfel de semnal poate să nu existe”. Există excepții la fiecare regulă, și se pare că ești una și asta e foarte interesant dacă da și ar fi interesant să învățăm cauza principală. Dar, din nou, ne uităm la ceea ce spun studiile științifice și încercăm să reflectăm asta în ceea ce scriem. În esență, scriem o formă de stil de "citire ușoară" care distrează lucrările de sondaj pe subiecte, mai degrabă decât să scriem lucrări de cercetare.<br/>Fa ceea ce te face fericit si probabil vei trai mai mult decat altfel; si chiar daca nu, macar te vei bucura de timpul pe care il ai.<br/>Cred că problema este atunci când sarea este amestecată cu grăsimea și care provoacă tensiune arterială ridicată. De exemplu, cineva a vorbit despre creșterea lor atunci când mănâncă chips-uri - asta pentru că chips-urile conțin grăsime. Același lucru ar fi valabil și pentru cartofii prăjiți sau alte feluri de mâncare grase. Cu toate acestea, dacă ați presăra sare pe ceva ca fructele, nu ar avea același efect și nu v-ar crește tensiunea arterială.<br/>Cred că sodiul are o reputaţie proastă, iar unii oameni consumă prea puţin. Cred ca sarea cu fructe sau salate este ok, dar problema este combinatia sare / grasime si daca te gandesti la asta, de obicei oamenii isi iau sarea in chipsuri de cartofi, cartofi prajiti, carne puternic condimentata, in feluri de mancare cremoase, etc.<br/>Persoana care a scris acest articol nu adaugă nimic de valoare la discuția despre tensiunea arterială ridicată, cu excepția încurajării oamenilor să-și bage capul în nisip.<br/>M-am luptat cu tensiunea arterială ridicată timp de aproximativ 12 ani de când un accident grav m-a făcut să fiu inactiv fizic timp de aproximativ un an după accident.<br/>Tensiunea arterială ridicată poate fi controlată cu și fără medicamente, iar indivizii răspund diferit la diferite tratamente și există tratamente naturale pentru această afecțiune.<br/>Tensiunea arterială ridicată poate provoca accidente vasculare cerebrale, hemorragie cerebrală și contribuie la diabet și boli de rinichi.<br/>Echilibrul dintre potasiu și sodiu în sângele nostru este foarte critic și, din păcate, majoritatea medicilor nu au nici o idee despre efectul pe care nutriția și hidratarea adecvată îl are asupra acestei afecțiuni.<br/>Majoritatea medicilor au fost doar să dea prescripții care pot sau nu pot funcționa.<br/>Există substanțe naturale care mi-au permis să scad tensiunea arterială în câteva zile de la extrem de mare la aproape normal, în timp ce medicii și farmaciștii vor spune că medicamentele (cum ar fi Cozaar și Norvasc) pot dura până la o lună pentru a lucra.<br/>Am descoperit că sucul unei lămâi cu coajă sau ulei esențial adăugat la 16 uncii de apă minerală a avut efecte semnificative.<br/>Consumul acestei băuturi o dată sau de două ori pe zi a avut un efect foarte semnificativ în cazul meu; tensiunea arterială a trecut de la 220/95 la 130/90 în decurs de 3 zile.<br/>Usturoiul (deodorizat) ajută, de asemenea, iar sucurile de fructe sau legume cu conținut scăzut de sare și conținut ridicat de potasiu ajută (săr V-8 scăzut sau verde V-8).<br/>Aceasta nu este o gândire de dorință; are de-a face cu chimia; acest lucru nu înseamnă că toată lumea va răspunde la fel la aceste tratamente, dar nu sunt de acord foarte puternic atunci când cineva spune că sarea nu are niciun efect asupra tensiunii arteriale.<br/>Acest lucru mi se pare a fi iresponsabil și cavaler, cu excepția cazului în care, desigur, lucrați pentru unul dintre producătorii de sare.<br/>Sarea este necesară și majoritatea sărurilor de masă au iod în ele, care este un nutrient esențial pentru oameni.<br/>Bea cantități suficiente de apă pură este, de asemenea, foarte important; ceva ce medicii mei nu s-au deranjat să menționeze.<br/>Acest lucru permite organismului să scape de excesul de sare și ajută organismul să se curețe.<br/>Există multe substanțe naturale și unele alimente (cum ar fi pesto) care pot ajuta la scăderea tensiunii arteriale și puteți găsi multe postări pe internet despre ele.<br/>Web Md și The Mayo Clinic au ambele postări pe acest subiect și am încredere în ele mult mai mult decât autorul acestui post.<br/>Acest lucru mi se pare a fi un exercițiu în apărarea indefensibilului.<br/>În ce scop?<br/>Cine a fost Hipocrate și ce naiba a știut?<br/>Am tensiune arterială extrem de scăzută. Dacă mă ridic prea repede, voi leșina pe față. Medicul meu mi-a spus să mănânc cât de multă sare vreau, nu vă faceți griji.<br/>În orice caz, voi lua toate aceste sfaturi cu un vârf de... știi ce. ;-D<br/>Mănânc multă sare (și mă refer la *LOT*). Acum câțiva ani, după ce m-am săturat să-mi spun în mod constant cât de rău este acest lucru, am decis să-l pun la încercare. Ca doctor, știu cum să planific științific un test și, pe parcursul mai multor luni, minimizând cât mai multe variabile posibil, mi-am testat tensiunea arterială la aportul obișnuit de sare față de aportul scăzut de sare. Rezultatele au fost aproape așa cum se aștepta, deși unii oameni pot fi ușor intoleranți la niveluri relativ ridicate de aport de sare, pentru mine nu a existat nicio diferență. M-am intors sa mananc mancarea asa cum imi place (sarat), si sa spun oricui ii sfatuieste impotriva acestui lucru ca pur si simplu nu stiu ce vorbesc despre LOL.<br/>Am 27 de ani. Am început să am tensiune arterială ridicată în timp ce luam Accutane acum un an și jumătate (Accutane mărește acumularea de colesterol). Ceea ce am experimentat a fost intens, pulsul meu a fost la 120 bpm, am fost amețit, mâinile mele strânse într-o formă neobișnuită de gheară și au furnicături până când au pierdut senzația. Am crezut că de fapt am fost pe moarte. Mi s-a spus că a fost doar un atac de panică, dar nu am avut niciodată probleme reale de anxietate. Mi s-a dat oxigen timp de o oră întreagă când dintr-o dată am început să-mi doresc sare. I-am cerut prietenului meu să alerge la McDonalds și să-mi aducă niște cartofi prăjiți în plus sărați. În câteva minute după ce am mâncat toată sarea, tensiunea arterială a revenit la normal, mâinile mi-au revenit și puteam să merg și să respir normal din nou.<br/>Găsesc că lucrurile care îl declanșează cel mai mult pentru mine sunt lipsa de somn, nu mănânc nimic toată ziua, porumb, grâu și săruri chimice cum ar fi MSG. Dar sarea de mare și sarea de masă normală nu o fac mai rău, o fac mai bună! Acestea fiind spuse, am avut întotdeauna rezultate ale testelor de sânge care arată niveluri ridicate de potasiu. Ar putea fi implicat acest lucru într-un fel? Dr. meu doar ridică din umeri, așa cum a fost cauzat de dragostea mea pentru cartofi și citrice lol<br/>Este posibil să aveți nevoie de un nou medic cu potasiu ridicat sau hiperkaliemie poate provoca episoadele pe care le descrieți și Accutane poate provoca hiperkaliemie.<br/>Potasiul și sodiul sunt în mod evident legate, deoarece celulele dvs. le schimbă în mod constant în și din celule pentru a menține concentrații intracelulare mai mari de potasiu.<br/>Cortizolul, care crește cu privarea de somn, nu mănâncă și alte stresuri inversează acest proces de concentrare a potasiului în celulă, dar este menit să crească excreția de potasiu, absorbția celulară a absorbției de sodiu și retenția de sodiu în rinichi, poate fi ceva greșit cu acest proces cu potasiu nu fiind excretat. Motivul normal este inhibarea sistemului renină-angiotensină, care reglează tensiunea arterială.<br/>Sarea hrănește glandele suprarenale, dar este posibil să doriți să obțineți mai multă vitamina C, care este concentrată acolo, precum și în glanda pituitară, deoarece acestea reglează cortizolul și vitamina C scade cortizolul și stresul, reducând probabil severitatea episoadelor.<br/>Lucruri de analizat, magneziu, vitamina e, glandele suprarenale, nivelurile de cupru/zinc, funcția renală și suprarenale.<br/>Farmacistul aici. Vă mulțumesc pentru toate comentariile utile pe acest site. Se pot vedea toate postările scrise inteligent de la oameni care și-au redus tensiunea arterială prin limitarea sării. Eu sunt unul dintre acești oameni. Tensiunea mea arterială acum un an era în medie de 180/120 atunci când nu era medicată, iar când luam 3 medicamente diferite, în medie 140/90. După ce m-am simțit groaznic, fie din cauza efectelor adverse ale medicamentelor, fie din cauza durerilor de cap din cauza tensiunii arteriale ridicate, am decis să-mi modific dieta. Rezultatele pe care le-am obținut au fost uimitoare. Tensiunea arterială perfect normală, 120/80. Fără dureri de cap, sau senzația că gâtul meu era umflat, sau senzația că capul meu era prea fierbinte.... am putut merge mai departe și mai departe. Am făcut acest lucru cu NU produse scumpe. Doar că, pe cât este posibil în zilele noastre în SUA, am mâncat alimente neprocesate și am evitat orice sare adăugată. Observați, toată sarea "adăugată". După cum mulți au subliniat în mod corect, sarea este necesară vieții umane. Și multe alimente conțin în mod natural toată sarea de care avem nevoie, deci nu este necesar să adăugați nimic. Ascultându-i pe acești presupuși experți, mă întreb cum a supraviețuit vreun om acum 10.000 de ani dacă nu a avut norocul să găsească un bloc de sare pe care să-l lingă în fiecare zi! Am citit un comentariu despre cineva care a avut rezultate bune din "suc de o lamaie cu coajă sau ulei esențial adăugat la 16 uncii de apă minerală". L-aș provoca pe el și pe alții să încerce doar sucul de lamaie cu apă. Găsesc că dacă mă curăț cu doar un pahar de apă cu lămâie o dată pe săptămână, a avut un efect splendid asupra sănătății mele. Celelalte ingrediente pot ajuta, dar ar fi un experiment interesant pentru tine. Deci, eu, ca, mulți, mulți alții, sunt sensibili la sare. Poate unii oameni pot mânca o cantitate uriașă de sare în mod regulat, fără efecte adverse asupra sănătății. Acest lucru nu este adevărat pentru mulți dintre noi, și este ofensator atunci când așa-numiții "profesioniști" sau "științi" contestă acest lucru. Un lucru le spun întotdeauna pacienților mei, "Când vine vorba de sănătatea ta, ai încredere în tine mai presus de toți ceilalți". Dacă sunteți convins că un anumit medicament vă face să vă simțiți rău, iar medicul sau farmacistul sugerează că totul este în capul dvs., aveți încredere în voi înșivă, nu în ei. Dacă tu, ca mine, te simți de o mie de ori mai bine atunci când limitezi consumul de sare sau alimente procesate, atunci te rog, continuă să faci ceea ce faci și nu asculta pe cei care sugerează altfel! Vei fi mai sănătos și mai fericit. Mulțumesc că m-ați ascultat, prieteni de departe.<br/>În timp ce este cu siguranță posibil că sunteți sensibil la sare, atunci când ați decis să vă schimbați dieta, ați schimbat multe alte lucruri în plus față de cât de multă sare ați mâncat. Două dintre cele mai ușoare modalități de a scădea tensiunea arterială fără a modifica sare sunt 1. pierde în greutate. 2. Consumați mai multe legume și fructe (alias alimente bogate în potasiu). Numeroase studii clinice și observaționale au arătat că raportul sodiu-potasiu este probabil mai important decât cantitatea de sodiu pe care o consumați. [Rețineți că acest lucru se aplică numai celor 99,999999% din omenire care mănâncă între 3k și 6k mg de sodiu pe zi. Sarea este, probabil, o problemă dacă mâncați departe de intervalul normal, cum ar fi 12,000mg + de sodiu pe zi.]<br/>Aveam de gând să spun practic același lucru. Aveam tensiune arterială ridicată... Am făcut o provocare Paleo de 30 de zile... Toate curățate de alimentele pământului. De fapt, mi-am crescut aportul de sare prin introducerea unei cantități mari de carne de vită sărată și alimente murate în dieta mea pentru gustări. Nu numai că tensiunea mea arterială a ajuns aproape perfectă, dar am pierdut 16 kilograme, dar nici măcar nu am fost cineva pe care să-l consideri excesul de greutate, pentru început, cu 178 lbs la 162 lbs în 30 de zile. Durerile mele de cap ciudate au dispărut... toate cele nouă yarzi care vin cu tensiune arterială ridicată. Sunt convins că sarea și tensiunea arterială nu sunt legate... și cred că este un polițist pentru oameni care într-adevăr trebuie să obțină pe o dietă sănătoasă reală.<br/>Acest articol este periculos și ar putea convinge pe cineva să folosească toată sarea pe care o doresc. Dar tot ce trebuie să fac este să mănânc câteva pungi mari de chipsuri de cartofi și voi obține 180/90 în câteva zile, stați departe de sare apoi timp de 3-4 zile și hidratați-vă bine, înapoi la 130/70. Acum "poate" sunt hipersensibil, dar din moment ce acest lucru s-a repetat de o jumătate de duzină de ori, evit sarea. Există o mulțime de alimente normale /<br/>Se pare că nu știți despre ce vorbiți... citiți intrarea Curt Nicol DD PhD de mai jos. și citiți din nou acest articol... ați fost părtinitoare de expunerea la medicii care au fost părtinitoare de ani și ani de toate yada..yada..yada... citiți articolul din nou. Bineînțeles, nu vei începe să mănânci sare pe kilogram... totul ar avea oricum un gust groaznic.<br/>Ceea ce este periculos este sfaturile și tratamentele fără bază științifică bazate numai pe ipoteze, efectul colateral al reducerii aportului regulat de sare al majorității oamenilor este consumul de alimente mai puțin procesate care conțin cantități uriașe de carbohidrați rafinați sau simpli, uleiuri foarte predispuse la oxidare, substanțe denaturate, contaminanți și aditivi.<br/>Reducerea acestora va duce la o nutriție generală îmbunătățită.<br/>Limitarea sarii pe cont propriu, fara alte variabile, va avea putin sau nici un efect in majoritatea oamenilor si poate fi in detrimentul celorlalti.<br/>Eu. Am introdus un comentariu detaliat de oprire și începerea testelor care 100% a dovedit ipoteza mea că Na a fost unul dintre marii contribuitori la tensiunea arterială. Este nevoie de un efort pentru a documenta și înregistra metodele și rezultatul. Al meu a fost la fel de mare ca 205/115. Am ajuns la o coerență de 100/65 timp de doi ani. Munca mea este documentată în această secțiune de comentarii, dar nu a apărut încă.<br/>O mulțime de oameni aici spun că mănâncă un sac de chips-uri crește tensiunea arterială. Nu își dau seama că nu este un aliment sănătos? Crezi că, eventual, nu conține toate lucrurile greșite?<br/>Trebuie să existe alte alimente bogate în sodiu pe care le pot folosi pentru a arăta modul în care sarea le afectează tensiunea arterială.<br/>Corect... ceea ce este rău este uleiul și grăsimea care merge țevile și constrângerea lor... plus chips-uri de cartofi, este tot amidon, care se transformă în zahăr, apoi grăsime ...<br/>Nu aș fi suficient de credul să mă gândesc un minut, că sarea NU este legată de tensiunea arterială ridicată și de creșterea temperaturii corpului, pentru că cu siguranță DA. Mi-am redus tensiunea arterială 160 peste 80 până la 119 peste 81 în câteva săptămâni prin reducerea aportului de sare sever. De ce de fiecare dată când mănânc mai multe porții de chipsuri de cartofi sau mănânc cartofi prăjiți Mc Donald, am imediat fața înroșită și febril? Am simțit și auzit, da, venele înguste din capul meu, după ce am hipertensiune arterială, dilată, se extinde și se rupe din nou, după ce am băut pahare și pahare de apă, cu dispariția febrei, dispariția disconfortului sau senzației de congestie a capului și scăderea tensiunii arteriale.<br/>Acest lucru mă deranjează cu adevărat, și nu trebuie să mărturisesc că sunt oarecum confuz acum. Îmi place sarea și pot consuma mai mult într-o singură masă decât ar trebui să consumați într-o zi. Nu părea să-mi afecteze b.p.<br/>Apoi, când b.p.-ul meu a început să crească pe măsură ce am îmbătrânit, doctorul meu a spus să taie sarea, așa că am făcut-o... fără efect real. De fapt, am fost internat în spital cu o infecție gravă, doar pentru a descoperi că, atunci când am fost externat, am fost ținut pe o dietă scăzută de sodiu, chiar dacă la admitere, nivelul meu de sodiu era periculos de scăzut.<br/>Toate acestea m-au făcut să cred că pericolele sodiului erau doar un mit, cel puțin pentru mine oricum. Dar apoi soția mea s-a îmbolnăvit. BP-ul ei a fost monitorizat în mod constant, deoarece a continuat să meargă prea jos. Obişnuiau să-i injecteze "sodiu" (apă sărată, cred eu) şi tensiunea arterială îi creştea aproape imediat.<br/>Deci, este că eu nu sunt sensibil la sare, sau este ceva în stomac care acționează ca o barieră (deci sarea ingerată nu vă afectează), în timp ce sarea intravenoasă va?<br/>Pentru ceva care este atât de fundamental în consilierea medicală, este atât de frustrant că pare să existe atât de puține cercetări, cel puțin cercetări de calitate făcute pe ea.<br/>Dimpotrivă, la o admitere ulterioară la spital, m-au pus din nou pe sodiu scăzut (o dată și idiotul îl pune în dosarul medical, pare imposibil să-l scoți...) și mi-au dat o tensiune arterială care reduce medicamentele. B.P.-ul meu a căzut prin podea și i-a îngrijorat la un moment dat.<br/>Medicamentele BP nu sunt dovedite pentru a îmbunătăți rezultatele sau pentru a fi în siguranță în majoritatea situațiilor. Medicina modernă este destul de periculoasă, ele ucid oamenii în mod constant cu ceea ce prescriu.<br/>Soția dvs. poate avea probleme renale și suprarenale, în timp ce este mai probabil să aveți probleme vasculare. Luați în considerare posibilele cauze de mediu, beți apă cu fluorură care crește absorbția plumbului, lipsa de antioxidanți, cum ar fi ala, vit a / e / c / d / k2 poate duce la creșterea sclerozei arteriale de stres oxidativ și a calcificării arterelor care restricționează capacitatea vezalelor de a diala, creșterea expunerii iritante ridică nivelurile de vasoconstriunerii și coagulării atât prin eliberarea de seroză.<br/>Aceste lucruri pot provoca probleme oriunde.<br/>Tocmai mi-am petrecut o oră scriind un comentariu. Medicul meu dorește să-l vadă. Nu apar. Ce se întâmplă? Mi-am pierdut timpul? Vă rugăm să răspundeți.<br/>Articol excelent. Articole de acest tip scot în evidență sănătatea nutters și know-it-all.... doar aruncați o privire la comentarii. Acest lucru îmi amintește și de „încălzirea globală”, de „schimbările climatice” (sau cum o numesc ei în această săptămână), de „experți” care o predică ca și cum ar fi fost Evanghelia, când și ei nu au nicio dovadă definitivă. |
| Nomadic Kirghiz. Golodnaia Steppe.<br/>This remarkable photograph shows a nomadic Kyrgyz family resting in the steppe grasslands. The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group widely spread over the area of eastern Turkestan. The man, with weathered face, is dressed in a skullcap and a frayed traditional striped coat. He is burdened with padded blankets and probably a small tent. The woman, with brilliant white turban, wears a tattered cloak and carries smaller bundles of blankets and clothes. Their small boy wears a colorful skullcap and a sparkling green silk jacket in the Chinese style. To the left is a desert thorn bush. The image is by Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863–1944), who used a special color photography process to create a visual record of the Russian Empire in the early 20th century. Some of Prokudin-Gorskii’s photographs date from about 1905, but the bulk of his work is from between 1909 and 1915, when, with the support of Tsar Nicholas II and the Ministry of Transportation, he undertook extended trips through many different parts of the empire. In 1911 he made two trips to an area of Central Asia then known as Turkestan (present-day Uzbekistan and neighboring states), where he photographed Islamic architectural monuments as well as Russian development projects, such as an irrigation scheme to make Golodnaia Steppe (“Hungry Steppe”) a productive area for raising cotton and wheat.<br/>Photo: Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.<br/>- acku Afghanistan<br/>- Image Size<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>- Contained in galleries | Kârgâzstanul nomadic, stepa Golodnaia.<br/>Această fotografie remarcabilă arată o familie de nomazi kirghizi odihnindu-se în pășunile stepei.

Unele dintre fotografiile lui Prokudin-Gorskii datează din 1905, dar cea mai mare parte a lucrării sale datează între 1909 și 1915, când, cu sprijinul țarului Nicolae al II-lea și al Ministerului Transporturilor, a întreprins călătorii lungi prin multe părți diferite ale imperiului. În 1911 a făcut două călătorii într-o zonă din Asia Centrală cunoscută atunci sub numele de Turkestan (astăzi Uzbekistan și statele vecine), unde a fotografiat monumente arhitecturale islamice, precum și proiecte de dezvoltare rusești, cum ar fi o schemă de irigare pentru a face din stepa Golodnaia ("stepa foamei") o zonă productivă pentru creșterea bumbacului și a grâului.<br/>Foto: Serghei Mihailovici Prokudin-Gorskii.<br/>- acku Afganistan<br/>- Dimensiunea imaginii<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>- Conținut în galerii |
| Prescribed burning is a tool used in native landscapes and commercial timberlands across the world. There are many reasons why a land manager might use prescribed burning to enhance or manage the land.<br/>One of the most beneficial results of prescribed burning, regardless of the intended end goal, is the reduction of fuel loads in the case a wildfire breaks out. Wildfires can be devastating for urban and rural communities across the country. In 2020, one of the worst most recent wildfire seasons in the United States, nearly 18,000 structures were lost to out-of-control fires, over half of those being homes. In the last decade, it has cost between $1.5 billion and $3 billion dollars each year for federal wildfire suppression tactics, including equipment and personnel.<br/>The top 10 most destructive fires by financial losses have occurred in California, with the largest being the 2018 Camp Fire, which incurred over $10.4 billion in expenses for those affected. Wildfires aren’t just financially impactful, they can cause major environmental damage and be a nuisance to general human activities.<br/>Of course, raging fires burning in the area means that road closures are likely, which impacts travel. In addition, smoke generated by wildfires can have strong effects on communities even hundreds of miles away as it is carried in the atmosphere. This can drop ash and particulate matter and impacts air quality, making it difficult for many to be outside. Communication can be impacted if fires approach telephone lines, cellphone towers, or even energy distribution centers.<br/>You can see why minimizing wildfires would result in a reduction to impacts to human activity.<br/>Environmental damage can be significant since wildfires often burn large swaths of lands, are high intensity, and have severe impacts. In 2020, nearly 60,000 fires in the United States, impacting over 10 million acres on the east and west coast. Typically more fires in the eastern states, but these fires are smaller in size and generally are less severe. Western states see marginally fewer fires than the East, but the western fires can be more intense and consume more acreage at once. This regional difference is generally seen because of the landscapes, the types of plants and fuel available to burn, as well as weather differences, particularly drought conditions. Wildfires impact plant communities and wildlife in the area, and overall have a negative influence on the environment.<br/>It may seem weird to fight fire with fire, but there are “good fires” and “bad fires.” Prescribed burning are like a prescription written by a doctor — the “doctor” in this case being the land manager. The prescription details what the goals of the burn are, the weather conditions when the burn should be conducted for the best results and least human impact, and the intensity of the fire to achieve the results.<br/>This prescription means that the fire will occur in a safe, controlled way with little impact on the environment or humans.<br/>Prescribed fire does more than just prevent raging wildfires, it can also benefit native landscapes, improve food sources and habitat for wildlife, or control underbrush in timber stands. Many native plants across the world are designed for fire to occur, since fires would naturally occur long before human intervention. Some plants need fire for their seed pods to open, some need other plants to be cleared out by fire so their seeds can germinate and succeed, while others are designed to withstand fire with thick, insulating bark or waxy foliage.<br/>Prescribed burners can tell you many stories of deer, turkey, quail, and other wildlife coming in immediately after a fire to consume plants and insects. Wildlife also benefit from improved nutrition in plants and better habitats in areas regenerating after a fire.<br/>Prescribed fire might be a beneficial tool for your land too. Reach out to your local forest service or prescribed burn association to see how prescribed burning might be implemented on your property. This important resource is vital to protect and encourage with the way we vote, so make sure those in office know this issue matters to you.<br/>Michelle Miller, the “Farm Babe,” is an internationally recognized keynote speaker, writer, and social media influencer and travels full time to advocate for agriculture.

Există multe motive pentru care un manager de teren ar putea folosi arderea prescrisă pentru a îmbunătăți sau a gestiona terenul.<br/>Unul dintre cele mai benefice rezultate ale arderii prescrise, indiferent de obiectivul final preconizat, este reducerea încărcăturii de combustibil în cazul în care izbucnește un incendiu de vegetație. Incendiile de vegetație pot fi devastatoare pentru comunitățile urbane și rurale din întreaga țară. În 2020, unul dintre cele mai grave sezoane recente de incendii de pădure din Statele Unite, aproape 18.000 de structuri au fost pierdute din cauza incendiilor scăpate de sub control, peste jumătate dintre acestea fiind case. În ultimul deceniu, a costat între 1,5 și 3 miliarde de dolari în fiecare an pentru tacticile federale de suprimare a incendiilor de vegetație, inclusiv echipamente și personal.<br/>Top 10 cele mai distructive incendii din cauza pierderilor financiare au avut loc în California, cel mai mare fiind Camp Fire 2018, care a generat cheltuieli de peste 10,4 miliarde de dolari pentru cei afectați. Incendiile de vegetație nu au doar un impact financiar, ele pot provoca daune majore mediului și pot fi o pagubă pentru activitățile umane generale.<br/>Desigur, incendiile aprinse în zonă înseamnă că este probabil ca drumurile să fie închise, ceea ce afectează călătoriile. În plus, fumul generat de incendiile de pădure poate avea efecte puternice asupra comunităților chiar și la sute de mile distanță, deoarece este transportat în atmosferă. Acest lucru poate dăuna cenușii și particulelor și afectează calitatea aerului, ceea ce face dificil pentru mulți să fie în aer liber. Comunicarea poate fi afectată dacă incendiile se apropie de liniile telefonice, turnurile de telefonie mobilă sau chiar de centrele de distribuție a energiei.<br/>Puteți vedea de ce reducerea incendiilor de pădure ar duce la o reducere a impactului asupra activității umane.<br/>Daunele aduse mediului pot fi semnificative, deoarece incendiile de pădure ard adesea suprafețe mari de terenuri, sunt de mare intensitate și au impacturi severe. În 2020, aproape 60.000 de incendii în Statele Unite, impactând peste 10 milioane de acri pe coasta de est și de vest. De obicei, mai multe incendii în statele estice, dar aceste incendii sunt mai mici în mărime și, în general, sunt mai puțin severe. Statele occidentale văd puțin mai puține incendii decât Estul, dar incendiile occidentale pot fi mai intense și pot consuma mai multe suprafețe deodată. Această diferență regională este observată în general din cauza peisajelor, a tipurilor de plante și a combustibilului disponibil pentru ardere, precum și a diferențelor meteorologice, în special a condițiilor de secetă. Incendiile de vegetație afectează comunitățile de plante și animalele sălbatice din zonă și, în general, au o influență negativă asupra mediului.<br/>Poate părea ciudat să lupți focul cu focul, dar există "focuri bune" și "focuri rele". Arsurile prescrise sunt ca o rețetă scrisă de un medic - "doctorul" în acest caz fiind administratorul terenului. Rețeta detaliază care sunt obiectivele arsurii, condițiile meteorologice în care arsurile ar trebui să fie efectuate pentru cele mai bune rezultate și cel mai mic impact uman și intensitatea focului pentru a obține rezultatele.<br/>Această prescripție înseamnă că incendiul va avea loc într-un mod sigur, controlat, cu impact redus asupra mediului sau a oamenilor.<br/>Focul prescris face mai mult decât să prevină incendiile furioase, poate, de asemenea, să beneficieze peisajele native, să îmbunătățească sursele de hrană și habitatul pentru animalele sălbatice sau să controleze arbuștii în standurile de lemn. Multe plante native din întreaga lume sunt proiectate pentru ca focul să aibă loc, deoarece incendiile ar avea loc în mod natural cu mult înainte de intervenția umană. Unele plante au nevoie de foc pentru ca păstăile lor de semințe să se deschidă, unele au nevoie de alte plante să fie curățate de foc, astfel încât semințele lor să poată germina și să reușească, în timp ce altele sunt concepute pentru a rezista focului cu scoarță groasă, izolantă sau frunziș ceros.<br/>Arzătoarele prescrise vă pot spune multe povești despre căprioare, curcani, prepelițe și alte animale sălbatice care vin imediat după un incendiu pentru a consuma plante și insecte. Fauna sălbatică beneficiază, de asemenea, de o nutriție îmbunătățită în plante și de habitate mai bune în zonele care se regenerează după un incendiu.<br/>Focul prescris poate fi un instrument benefic pentru terenul dvs. Contactați serviciul forestier local sau asociația de ardere prescrisă pentru a vedea modul în care arderea prescrisă ar putea fi implementată pe proprietatea dvs. Această resursă importantă este vitală pentru a proteja și încuraja cu modul în care votăm, așa că asigurați-vă că cei din funcție știu că această problemă contează pentru dvs.<br/>Michelle Miller, "Farm Babe", este o speaker, scriitoare și influencer social media recunoscută la nivel internațional și călătorește cu normă întreagă pentru a apăra agricultura.

| The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I – Book Review<br/>The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I: Battalion Histories Based on Official Documents. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 pages, photographs, maps. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>The Fourth Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, was one of the more famous combat units in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. Consisting of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion (Marine), the Fourth Brigade went through five main battles: Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont, and the closing days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.<br/>Clark, a former Marine and an author with many historical Marine Corps books to his credit, based this history largely upon official records. The book is not footnoted until Chapter 3, and then it is only sparsely footnoted. Thus, in most cases, we cannot know precisely where a given quote or information comes from. While we may assume that an operations report or field message is the origin of some data, there is nothing to tell us where we may find that information. Quotes, including entire block quotations, are left un-footnoted with no indication as to the origin of the material. Probably most of the information comes from the ten-volume Records of the Second Division, listed in the bibliography, which is grist for the Marine Corps enthusiast’s mill.<br/>The book is divided into eight chapters; the first chapter gives an overview of the Fourth Brigade’s history as a whole. Each of the rest of the chapters covers one of the battalions of the brigade, plus the brigade’s machine gun battalion. Each chapter is in turn arranged chronologically in a style reminiscent of a diary or log, with narrative falling under a given day or range of days. This arrangement makes for a disjointed overall history of the brigade; it is difficult to get the feel of how the battalions fit into the division’s role during a battle. The narrative falls into recording what seem like disjointed events without the benefit of broader context. Furthermore, the battalion/chapter arrangement ensures an amount of repetition because the same background must be repeated for each battalion, and each battle is “fought” seven times. There are many fine photographs included, and the maps are adequate, although I would prefer more maps with greater detail. Surprisingly, neither the photographs nor the maps are credited.<br/>With all that being said, it should be recognized that the author, an expert on this subject, has made an important effort to document the history of this brigade. The original sources, field messages in particular, capture the confusion and flavor of combat as experienced by the junior officers in the brigade. Historians interested in the Fourth Brigade are fortunate to have available an abundance of its field messages (or at least copies thereof). Readers who are not familiar with these messages will find those quoted in the book to be an enlightening window on the world of AEF combat.<br/>Likewise, there are some interesting tidbits to be gleaned from the extensive array of operations reports included. One example, which illustrated how the AEF learned “on the fly,” is a report written by Lt. Col. Frederick M. Wise, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, after fighting at Belleau Wood. Wise’s enumeration of twenty-three lessons learned is quoted in full and provides some interesting reading. What also comes through in these messages and reports is that, especially in the early battles, command and control issues plagued even the vaunted Marines. Platoons and companies became lost and diverged from their intended path as battalion commanders anxiously sought information via runners. It’s also interesting to see the degree of involvement at Belleau Wood by the brigade commander, Brigadier General James G. Harbord (US Army). Harbord wasn’t shy about sending messages directly to battalion and even company commanders, bypassing regimental commanders.<br/>Despite the issues and troubles, which were common to all units fighting in World War I, the 2nd Division succeeded in making an enviable record (although, it must be said, at a great cost in casualties). Most historians agree that it was one of the two best divisions in the AEF (the other being the First Division), and the Fourth Brigade did its part to earn that reputation. The success of the brigade can in part be attributed to the personal heroism of its officers and men. The author, probably using award citations or recommendations, has carefully recorded the heroic feats of individual Marines, soldiers, and Navy corpsmen; this is a valuable contribution to the history of the brigade and a fine tribute to brave men.<br/>This book will appeal to readers who are interested in the Marine Corps. For those who are not familiar with the 2nd Division, it might be helpful to first read a history of that division (for example, The Battery Press’s 1989 reprint of The Second Division, American Expeditionary Force in France, 1917-1919). That history, although a bit dry in places, will help put the action described in Clark’s book in context.<br/>Peter L. Belmonte is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and freelance historian. A veteran of Operation Desert Storm, he has written extensively on immigration and military history, and his current studies focus on the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. His most recent book, Days of Perfect Hell: The 26th U.S. Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, October-November, 1918, will be released by Schiffer Books in October. | A patra brigadă marină în Primul Război Mondial – Review<br/>Brigada a patra marină în Primul Război Mondial: Istorii Batalion bazate pe documente oficiale. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 pagini, fotografii, hărți. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>Brigada a IV-a, parte a Diviziei a II-a, a fost una dintre cele mai faimoase unități de luptă din Forțele Expediționare Americane (AEF) din Marele Război. Alcătuită din Regimentele 5 și 6 Marine și Batalionul 6 Mitraliere (Marine), Brigada a 4-a a trecut prin cinci bătălii principale: Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont și zilele de încheiere ale Ofensivei Meuse-Argonne.<br/>Clark, un fost pușcaș marin și un autor cu multe cărți istorice ale Corpului Marinei, a bazat această istorie în mare parte pe înregistrările oficiale. Cartea nu este notată de subsol până la capitolul 3, iar apoi este doar rar notată de subsol. Astfel, în majoritatea cazurilor, nu putem ști exact de unde provine un anumit citat sau informații. Deși putem presupune că un raport de operațiuni sau un mesaj de teren este originea unor date, nu există nimic care să ne spună unde putem găsi acele informații. Citate, inclusiv citate întregi bloc, sunt lăsate fără subsol, fără nici o indicație cu privire la originea materialului. Probabil cea mai mare parte a informațiilor provin din cele zece volume ale Înregistrărilor Diviziei a II-a, enumerate în bibliografie, care este grămadă pentru moara entuziaștilor Marine Corps.<br/>Cartea este împărțită în opt capitole; primul capitol oferă o imagine de ansamblu a istoriei Brigăzii a Patra. Fiecare dintre celelalte capitole acoperă unul dintre batalioanele brigăzii, plus batalionul de mitraliere al brigăzii. Fiecare capitol este, la rândul său, aranjat în ordine cronologică într-un stil care amintește de un jurnal sau jurnal, cu narațiune care se încadrează într-o anumită zi sau interval de zile. Acest aranjament face ca istoria generală a brigăzii să fie dezbinată; este dificil să se înțeleagă modul în care batalioanele se potrivesc în rolul diviziei în timpul unei bătălii. Narațiunea cade în înregistrarea a ceea ce pare a fi evenimente deconectate fără beneficiul unui context mai larg. În plus, aranjamentul batalion/capitol asigură o cantitate de repetare, deoarece același fundal trebuie repetat pentru fiecare batalion, iar fiecare bătălie este "luptată" de șapte ori. Sunt incluse multe fotografii frumoase, iar hărțile sunt adecvate, deși aș prefera mai multe hărți cu mai multe detalii. Surprinzător, nici fotografiile, nici hărțile nu sunt creditate.<br/>Cu toate acestea, trebuie recunoscut faptul că autorul, un expert în acest domeniu, a făcut un efort important pentru a documenta istoria acestei brigăzi. Sursele originale, în special mesajele de pe teren, captează confuzia și aroma luptei așa cum au experimentat ofițerii juniori din brigadă. Istoricii interesați de Brigada a IV-a sunt norocoși să aibă la dispoziție o abundență de mesaje de teren (sau cel puțin copii ale acestora). Cititorii care nu sunt familiarizați cu aceste mesaje le vor găsi pe cele citate în carte ca fiind o fereastră de iluminare a lumii luptelor AEF.<br/>De asemenea, există câteva indicii interesante care trebuie colectate din gama extinsă de rapoarte de operațiuni incluse. Un exemplu, care ilustrează modul în care AEF a învățat "pe loc", este un raport scris de locotenent-colonelul Frederick M. Wise, comandantul Batalionului al 2-lea, al 5-lea pușcași marini, după lupta de la Belleau Wood. Enumerarea celor douăzeci și trei de lecții învățate de înțelept este citată în întregime și oferă o lectură interesantă. Ceea ce reiese, de asemenea, din aceste mesaje și rapoarte este că, mai ales în primele bătălii, problemele de comandă și control au afectat chiar și pușcașii marini lăudați. Platoanele și companiile s-au pierdut și s-au deviat de la calea intenționată, deoarece comandanții batalionului căutau cu nerăbdare informații prin alergători. De asemenea, este interesant de văzut gradul de implicare la Belleau Wood de către comandantul brigadei, generalul de brigadă James G. Harbord (armata SUA). Harbord nu se temea să trimită mesaje direct către batalion și chiar comandanți de companii, ocolind comandanții de regiment.<br/>În ciuda problemelor și necazurilor, care erau comune tuturor unităților care luptau în Primul Război Mondial, Divizia a 2-a a reușit să facă un record de invidiat (deși, trebuie spus, la un cost mare în victime). Majoritatea istoricilor sunt de acord că a fost una dintre cele mai bune două divizii din AEF (cealaltă fiind prima divizie), iar Brigada a patra și-a făcut partea pentru a câștiga această reputație. Succesul brigadei poate fi atribuit în parte eroismului personal al ofițerilor și oamenilor săi. Autorul, probabil folosind citate de premii sau recomandări, a înregistrat cu atenție faptele eroice ale pușcașilor marini, soldaților și corpurilor marinei; aceasta este o contribuție valoroasă la istoria brigăzii și un omagiu deosebit pentru oamenii curajoși.<br/>Această carte va atrage cititorii care sunt interesați de Corpul Marinei. Pentru cei care nu sunt familiarizați cu Divizia a 2-a, ar putea fi util să citiți mai întâi o istorie a acelei divizii (de exemplu, republicarea din 1989 a The Battery Press a Diviziei a 2-a, Forța Expediționară Americană în Franța, 1917-1919). Această istorie, deși un pic uscată în unele locuri, va ajuta la contextualizarea acțiunii descrise în cartea lui Clark.<br/>Peter L. Belmonte este un ofițer retras al Forțelor Aeriene ale SUA și un istoric independent. Veteran al Operațiunii Desert Storm, a scris mult despre imigrație și istorie militară, iar studiile sale actuale se concentrează asupra Forțelor Expediționare Americane în Primul Război Mondial. Cea mai recentă carte a sa, Zilele Iadului Perfect: Regimentul 26 Infanterie SUA în Ofensiva Meuse-Argonne, octombrie-noiembrie 1918, va fi publicată de Schiffer Books în octombrie. |
