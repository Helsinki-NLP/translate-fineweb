| The workplace can be a complex environment, with numerous laws and regulations that govern the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers. In Canada, the legal framework that governs employment relationships is known as status law. Status law covers a wide range of issues, from hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety. Understanding these laws is critical for employees, who can use this information to protect their rights and advocate for themselves in the workplace. This guide will provide a brief overview of some of the most common law cases in Canada.<br/>Hiring and Termination:<br/>One of the most important aspects of status law is the hiring process. Employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws and ensure that they do not make hiring decisions based on factors such as race, gender, age, or religion. Once an employee has been hired, the employer is also required to follow specific procedures if they decide to terminate the employee. By Law includes providing the employee with adequate notice, or paying them severance if the termination is without cause. best employment lawyer Toronto can advise about it.<br/>Discrimination and Harassment:<br/>Another critical aspect of status law is protecting employees from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfairly based on a personal characteristic, such as race, gender, age, or religion. Harassment is any behavior that creates a hostile or offensive working environment. In both cases, employees have the right to file a complaint with their employer or with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.<br/>Wages and Hours of Work:<br/>Status law also regulates the wages and hours of work for employees. Employers must comply with minimum wage laws and ensure that employees receive the appropriate overtime pay for any hours worked over the standard workweek. In addition, employers must provide employees with breaks and time off for holidays, vacations, and sick leave.<br/>Finally, status law requires employers to maintain a safe working environment for their employees. This includes providing adequate training, equipment, and safety protocols to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. Employees have the right to refuse work if they believe it is unsafe, and employers must investigate and address any safety concerns raised by employees and represented by the best employment lawyer in Toronto.<br/>In conclusion, understanding the common cases in Canadian status law is essential for employees to navigate the workplace and protect their rights. From hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety, employees need to be aware of the laws that govern their employment relationship. If employees have any questions or concerns, they can seek advice from a lawyer or consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. By knowing their rights and responsibilities, employees can ensure a fair and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues. | Работното место може да биде комплексна средина, со бројни закони и прописи кои ги регулираат правата и одговорностите на вработените и работодавачите. Во Канада, правната рамка која ги регулира работните односи е позната како закон за статус. Законот за статус опфаќа широк спектар на прашања, од вработување и откажување до дискриминација и безбедност на работното место. Разбирањето на овие закони е од клучно значење за вработените, кои можат да ги користат овие информации за да ги заштитат своите права и да се залагаат за себе на работното место. Овој водич ќе обезбеди краток преглед на некои од најчестите правни случаи во Канада.<br/>Вработување и завршување:<br/>Еден од најважните аспекти на законот за статус е процесот на вработување. Работодавците мора да се усогласат со анти-дискриминациските закони и да осигураат дека не донесуваат одлуки за вработување врз основа на фактори како што се раса, пол, возраст или религија. Откако вработениот е вработен, работодавачот исто така е должен да ги следи специфичните процедури ако одлучат да го откажат вработениот. Со закон вклучува обезбедување на вработениот со соодветно известување или плаќање на отпуштање ако откажувањето е без причина. Најдобар адвокат за вработување Торонто може да советува за тоа.<br/>Дискриминација и малтретирање:<br/>Друг критичен аспект на законот за статус е заштитата на вработените од дискриминација и малтретирање на работното место. Дискриминацијата се јавува кога вработениот е третиран неправедно врз основа на лични карактеристики, како што се раса, пол, возраст или религија. Малтретирање е секое однесување кое создава непријателска или навредлива работна средина. Во двата случаи, вработените имаат право да поднесат жалба до нивниот работодавач или до Канадската комисија за човекови права.<br/>Плата и работно време:<br/>Законот за статус, исто така, ги регулира платите и работните часови за вработените. Работодавците мора да се усогласат со законите за минимална плата и да обезбедат вработените да добијат соодветна прекувремена плата за сите часови одработени во текот на стандардната работна недела. Покрај тоа, работодавачите мора да им обезбедат на вработените паузи и слободно време за одмор, одмор и боледување.<br/>Конечно, законот за статус бара од работодавачите да одржуваат безбедна работна средина за своите вработени. Ова вклучува обезбедување на соодветна обука, опрема и безбедносни протоколи за спречување на несреќи и повреди на работното место. Вработените имаат право да одбијат работа ако веруваат дека тоа не е безбедно, а работодавачите мора да ги истражат и да се справат со сите безбедносни проблеми што ги покренале вработените и ги претставува најдобриот адвокат за вработување во Торонто.<br/>Во заклучок, разбирањето на вообичаените случаи во канадскиот закон за статус е од суштинско значење за вработените да се движат на работното место и да ги заштитат своите права. Од вработување и откажување до дискриминација и безбедност на работното место, вработените треба да бидат свесни за законите кои го регулираат нивниот однос за вработување. Ако вработените имаат било какви прашања или загриженост, тие можат да побараат совет од адвокат или да се консултираат со Канадската комисија за човекови права. Со познавање на своите права и одговорности, вработените можат да обезбедат фер и безбедна работна средина за себе и за своите колеги. |
| There's an old adage in the auto industry that says your vehicle loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot. The computer and technology industry is not so different, in that new parts and systems are constantly pushing the envelope of performance and value, making it impossible to have a top-of-the-line system for very long. The purpose of this paper is to step back in time 10 years and examine the technology landscape then to see how it compares to today's technologies we know and love.<br/>Much has been written, and much is still debated about the technology axiom called; Moore's Law. Some people interpret the law to mean a doubling of computer power every 18 months to 2 years, while others maintain it means a doubling of the numbers of transistors (microscopic on / off switches if you will) engineers are able to print into the same amount of silicon. In fact Moore stated that transistor counts would double every year, which he later adjusted to be every 2 years) Regardless, this trend of performance and transistor growth has held true for over 40 years.<br/>More recently, Moore's law has been applied to graphics processing units (GPUs) as well. The GPU is actually not even 10 years old at the time of writing. The official term GPU was coined with the nVidia GeForce 256 series of 3D cards. Released in August 1999, this was the first chip that was able to compute vertex transformations and pixel lighting in hardware. Since its release, graphics processing power has followed a similar trend of doubling performance every 18 months to 2 years. This article is not a technical document, rather a glimpse into the past 10 years ago to give you an idea of how far we've come in such a short time.<br/>A Little History About the Author:<br/>The year was 1999. It was my sophomore / junior year in high school. Now I'll pause so that 90% of the readers who grow up in the 70s and 80's can turn up their nose and stop reading.<br/>Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's continue.<br/>I am an internet child. I got into computers, and all manner of electronic geekery just as the Internet was becoming something that "just might catch on". My high school was not quite on the boring edge of technology as it was, but we were one of the first public schools in my area to be equipped with a full T1 line and the 1.5Mbps of awesome dedicated bandwidth that it piped through the network . Our network was built from a hodge-podge mixture of nice PC computers labs (mostly K6 200MHz / Win 95 machines), and a network engineers nightmare concoction of Macintoshes; LC II's up through new G3 iMacs.<br/>In 1999 I was still rocking a 486 DX-33 PC with 8MB of ram and Windows 3.11 as my PC at home, while my parents had a nice Pentium 100 Windows 95 machine my siblings and I would fight for time on. So what was the point of those last couple paragraphs you're probably asking? Well, that is where I was, and what I was using 10 years ago in computing, and hopefully it got you thinking back a decade to what you were computing on.<br/>10 years ago today, The computer world was working itself into a frenzy, getting ready for the near future release of the brand new Intel Pentium III Processor. The best money could do was a Pentium II processor at 450MHz with PC100 Memory. Rival AMD was doing alright for itself peddling its budget conscious K6-2 series of processors. Your average computer cost around $ 2000- $ 2500 at this time for a PC with a solid Pentium II processor. The Pentium III was due to be released on February 26th, and was the subject of a wicked debate over the merits of its built in unique ID number. Also noteworthy was its inclusion of the first SSE instruction set (The modern Core i7 processor is at SSE4 +). However without software designed to make use of the new instructions the processor was not much faster than an equivalent clocked Pentium II CPU and took quite a bit of heat from the press.<br/>On the graphics front the war between nVidia and 3DFx was raging. nVidia, a relative newcomer to the field, was riding high on top of their very successful TNT (Twin-Texel) video processor, while 3DFx was fighting to retain its market leadership title with its Voodoo3 line of graphics cards. The Voodoo cards were excellent performers, however the TNT cards had the advantage of 32 bit color while the Voodoo's were stuck at 24 bits. ATI was around and kicking with their Rage series of 3D cards (especially popular as integrated chips in servers and workstations), however they never really entered into the hardcore 3D accelerator race until the Radeon line debuted in 2000.<br/>In 1999 the internet boom was just beginning and attracting massive amounts of attention and investment capital from all over the globe. The big business of the time was in the search and portal business. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and Lycos were perhaps the most recognizable and capable players in this industry. Google -say-wha? Other companies from other industries, such as television media, and ISPs were taking notice, and buying up internet portals right and left in an attempt to tap into the viral spread of the internet. New technologies like Java were coming into their own, and began to lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. Studies determined that by 1999 about half of US households had a computer, and most of the new computer purchases were being made to get online.<br/>PDA's were quickly becoming the new must have gadget. The Palm Pilot being the device that led the charge. I myself had a Palm IIIe toward the later half of 2000. Personal pagers were still hot sellers, but cell phones were getting smaller and more practical and affordable. Also a war was heating up in the computer memory segment. Samsung introduced new DDR memory chips that promised to double the effective bandwidth of existing memory chips in future setups, however Rambus was busy developing their own high speed RAM for use in high end Intel systems.<br/>This field is possibly a bit too large to cover here, but a brief OS recap: The PC world was running strong with windows 98, and anxiously awaiting the updated Windows 98 Second Edition due out in May 1999. The Macintosh crowd was plugging away happily on their Mac OS 8.5 Machines, while awaiting an update to OS 9 sometime later that year. Linux was also starting to come into its own, as big name vendors like IBM were starting to bundle distributions of Redhat, Caldera, and others with some servers.<br/>I'll admit this article was more for my amusement and reminiscing than anything else. I hope that somewhere in the course of this mass of words and broken sentences, you too had some good recollections of computer equipment past. It's good to remember the technologies we grow up with and we are fortunately enough to have the robust internet we are used to today to help conjure up images and technical specs of those glory days. Sites like the Tech Time Machine exist to help us relive those days, and have a few chuckles at equipment we thought we'd never use to its full potential. I remember touching a Pentium 200MMX machine for the first time and being in awe at its raw speed and seemingly infinite possibilities. Now I constantly get upset with the speed of my current 3GHz dual core Athlon X2 6000+ PC. I can not even imagine how many windows that Pentium 200 would have thrown out of today. It's a crazy world we live in. | Постои стара поговорка во автомобилската индустрија која вели дека вашето возило ја губи вредноста веднаш штом го возите надвор од паркингот. Компјутерската и технолошката индустрија не е толку различна, во тоа што новите делови и системи постојано го туркаат пликот на перформансите и вредноста, што го прави невозможно да се има врвен систем за многу долго време. Целта на овој труд е да се вратиме 10 години наназад и да го испитаме технолошкиот пејзаж, а потоа да видиме како се споредува со денешните технологии што ги познаваме и сакаме.<br/>Многу е напишано, а многу се уште се дебатира за аксиомата на технологијата наречена Муров закон. Некои луѓе го толкуваат законот да значи двојно зголемување на моќта на компјутерот на секои 18 месеци до 2 години, додека други тврдат дека тоа значи двојно зголемување на бројот на транзистори (микроскопски вклучени / исклучени прекинувачи, ако сакате) инженерите можат да печатат во иста количина на силикон. Всушност, Мур изјавил дека бројот на транзисторите ќе се удвојува секоја година, што подоцна тој го прилагодил на секои 2 години) Без оглед на тоа, овој тренд на перформанси и раст на транзисторот важи повеќе од 40 години.<br/>Неодамна, законот на Мур се применува и за графички процесорски единици (GPU). GPU всушност не е ниту 10 години во времето на пишување. Официјалниот термин GPU беше измислен со nVidia GeForce 256 серија на 3D картички. Објавен во август 1999 година, ова беше првиот чип кој можеше да ги пресмета трансформациите на вертекс и пикселното осветлување во хардверот. Од неговото ослободување, графичката процесорска моќ следи сличен тренд на двојно зголемување на перформансите на секои 18 месеци до 2 години. Оваа статија не е технички документ, туку поглед во изминатите 10 години за да ви даде идеја за тоа колку далеку сме стигнале за толку кратко време.<br/>Кратка приказна за авторот:<br/>Годината беше 1999. Тоа беше мојата втора / помлада година во средно училиште. Сега ќе застанам, така што 90% од читателите кои растат во 70-тите и 80-тите може да го свртат носот и да престанат да читаат.<br/>Добро, сега кога тоа е надвор од патот, да продолжиме.<br/>Јас сум интернет дете. Влегов во компјутери, и сите видови на електронски џуџиња, исто како што интернетот стануваше нешто што "само може да се фати". Моето средно училиште не беше сосема на досадниот раб на технологијата како што беше, но ние бевме едно од првите јавни училишта во мојата област да бидат опремени со целосна Т1 линија и 1.5Mbps на неверојатен посветен пропусен опсег што го цевководеше низ мрежата . Нашата мрежа беше изградена од мешавина од убави компјутерски лаборатории (најчесто K6 200MHz / Win 95 машини), и мрежни инженери кошмарна комбинација на Macintoshes; LC II е преку нови G3 iMacs.<br/>Во 1999 година сè уште се лулав со 486 DX-33 компјутер со 8MB рам и Windows 3.11 како мојот компјутер дома, додека моите родители имаа убава машина Pentium 100 Windows 95 моите браќа и сестри и јас ќе се борев за време. Која беше поентата на последните неколку пасуси што веројатно ги прашувате? Па, тоа е каде што бев, и она што го користев пред 10 години во компјутерите, и се надевам дека ве натера да размислувате една деценија назад на она што го пресметувате.<br/>Пред 10 години денес, компјутерскиот свет се работеше себеси во лудило, подготвувајќи се за блиската иднина на новото ослободување на процесорот Intel Pentium III. Најдобрите пари што можеше да ги направи беше процесор Pentium II на 450MHz со PC100 меморија. Ривалот AMD правеше добро за себе продавајќи ја својата буџетска свесна K6-2 серија на процесори. Вашиот просечен компјутер чини околу $ 2000- $ 2500 во тоа време за компјутер со солиден процесор Pentium II. Пентиум III требаше да биде објавен на 26 февруари и беше предмет на злобна дебата за заслугите на неговиот изграден во уникатен идентификациски број. Исто така, вреди да се забележи неговото вклучување на првиот SSE инструкциски сет (Модерниот процесор Core i7 е на SSE4 +). Сепак, без софтвер дизајниран да ги користи новите инструкции, процесорот не бил многу побрз од еквивалентниот Pentium II процесор и земал многу топлина од печатот.<br/>На графичкиот фронт беснееше војната помеѓу nVidia и 3DFx. nVidia, релативен новајлија на полето, возеше високо на врвот на нивниот многу успешен TNT (Twin-Texel) видео процесор, додека 3DFx се бореше да ја задржи својата лидерска титула на пазарот со својата Voodoo3 линија на графички картички. Вуду картичките биле одлични изведувачи, но ТНТ картичките имале предност на 32-битната боја, додека Вуду картичките биле заглавени на 24 бита. ATI беше наоколу со нивната серија на 3D картички Rage (особено популарни како интегрирани чипови во серверите и работните станици), но тие никогаш не влегле во трката за хардкор 3D забрзување сè додека Radeon линијата не дебитирала во 2000 година.<br/>Во 1999 интернет бумот беше само почеток и привлекување на огромни количини на внимание и инвестициски капитал од целиот свет. Големиот бизнис на тоа време беше во пребарување и портал бизнис. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite и Lycos беа можеби најпрепознатливите и способни играчи во оваа индустрија. Google -say-wha? Други компании од други индустрии, како што се телевизиските медиуми и интернет провајдерите, прифаќаа и ги купуваа интернет порталите десно и лево во обид да се приклучат на вирусното ширење на интернетот. Новите технологии како Java доаѓаат во своите, и почнаа да ги поставуваат темелите за интернетот каков што го знаеме денес. Истражувањата утврдиле дека до 1999 година околу половина од американските домаќинства имале компјутер, а поголемиот дел од новите компјутерски купувања биле направени за да се добијат на интернет.<br/>PDA-ите брзо стануваа новиот гаџет. Палм Пилот беше уредот што го водеше полнењето. Јас самиот имав Палм IIIe кон крајот на 2000 година. Личните пејџери сѐ уште беа жешки продавачи, но мобилните телефони стануваа помали и попрактични и поприфатливи. Исто така, војната се загреваше во сегментот на компјутерската меморија. Samsung воведе нови DDR меморијски чипови кои ветија дека ќе го удвојат ефективниот пропусен опсег на постоечките меморијски чипови во идните поставувања, но Rambus беше зафатен со развивање на сопствена RAM меморија со голема брзина за употреба во хигх енд Интел системите.<br/>Ова поле е веројатно малку преголемо за да се покрие тука, но краток преглед на оперативниот систем: Светот на компјутерот работеше силно со Windows 98 и со нетрпение го чека ажурираното Windows 98 Второ издание кое треба да излезе во мај 1999 година. Мекинтош толпата среќно се приклучуваше на нивните Mac OS 8.5 машини, додека чекаше ажурирање на OS 9 некаде подоцна истата година. Линукс, исто така, почна да доаѓа во своја, како големи именувачи како IBM почнаа да се сноп дистрибуции на Redhat, Caldera, и други со некои сервери.<br/>Ќе признаам дека оваа статија беше повеќе за мојата забава и потсетување од било што друго. Се надевам дека некаде во текот на оваа маса на зборови и скршени реченици, вие исто така имаше некои добри сеќавања на компјутерска опрема минатото. Добро е да се запамети технологијата со која растеме и ние сме доволно среќни што имаме робустен интернет на кој сме навикнати денес за да помогнеме да се поттикнат слики и технички спецификации од тие славни денови. Веб-сајтови како Технолошката временска машина постојат за да ни помогнат да ги оживееме тие денови и да имаме неколку насмевки на опремата за која мислевме дека никогаш нема да го искористиме нејзиниот целосен потенцијал. Се сеќавам дека за прв пат допрев машина Pentium 200MMX и бев во стравопочит со неговата сурова брзина и навидум бесконечни можности. Сега постојано се вознемирувам со брзината на мојот сегашен 3GHz двојно јадро Athlon X2 6000 + PC. Не можам ни да замислам колку прозорци што Пентиум 200 би ги фрлил од денес. Тоа е луд свет во кој живееме. |
| The cultural anthropology major and minor offer a holistic understanding of human diversity. By exploring, analyzing, and understanding patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors, shared histories, language, visual representations and material realities, cultural anthropology focuses on what it means to be human. Our courses address relevant concerns such as food and nutrition; urban, rural, and global adaptive strategies; environmental sustainability; and economic development. Through its comparative and engaged field research methods, cultural anthropology recognizes culture as the primary means by which humans engage in social and environmental interactions to define meaningful and purposeful lives. Cultural anthropology complements well all other undergraduate majors.<br/>Top 3 Skills Learned<br/>- Critical thinking<br/>- Qualitative research methods<br/>- Partnership & collaboration with community<br/>Usually this happens toward the end of the Introduction to Anthropology course, when you realize that anthropology opens doors to new ways of looking at relevant problems in our world.

| Fact or Myth: Sodium Raises Blood Pressure<br/>Well, Matt, it turns out a high sodium diet might not raise blood pressure, nor have any sort of adverse effect on cardiovascular health at all. But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence (and there is more evidence that says it doesn’t than does).<br/>The debate over eating too much salt has been around since the 1960s. Almost every major governmental health organization embraces the idea that eating too much salt is damaging to your health. Most major news outlets report on these recommendations and people tend to try and follow them. This is most likely why most of us, especially the elderly with heart problems, know to reduce the amount of salt we eat. Those of us who like the idea that any recommendation be backed up by solid evidence, have to step back on this one. As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.<br/>So why have most health organizations pushed the idea of low sodium diets? The theory behind their supposition is sound, and there are some studies that show a minor risk of elevated blood pressure with extremely high salt intake. Unfortunately, there are many other studies that show no increase, and still some that show reducing salt intake might actually raise your blood pressure! Let’s look at the controversy in more detail.<br/>The idea salt will increase your blood pressure has to do with osmotic pressure. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell walls), from areas of lower solute concentration (in this case salt) to areas of higher solute concentration. This naturally equalizes the solute concentration on both sides of the membrane. (This osmotic pressure is also why salt can be used to preserves meat.)<br/>So the theory goes that when we eat too much salt, our bloodstream has more sodium in it than the surrounding areas of our body. This causes the water in those areas to be pulled into our bloodstream. The increase in water within the arteries and veins causes an increase in the pressure within those arteries and veins. The salt itself also acts like an irritant within the arteries causing them to constrict. This too is thought to increase your blood pressure.<br/>The theory seems, on the surface, very sound. After all, we can make the process of salt pulling water through membranes happen time and time again in the lab. The question is, does this actually happen within our bodies, and does this actually cause long term hypertension (high blood pressure)?<br/>In 1969, Lewis Dahl testified before Sen. George McGovern’s “select committee on nutrition and human needs”. He was concerned about the high concentrations of sodium in baby foods and thought this might cause increase in people’s blood pressure long term. His reasoning was that studies done on rats showed increases in the blood pressure of the rats.<br/>The conversation about salt and hypertension began to circulate among health organizations. The National Institutes of Health, in 1972, began introducing “High Blood Pressure Education Programs”. As their evidence, they pointed out observationally, populations who ate very little sodium had low incidents of high blood pressure. They also pointed to the rat modeling. Scientists at the time questioned this, as the rat studies had them eating 60 times what the average person does. They also pointed out the populations who ate low sodium diets, also ate low amounts of other things, like sugar (which also affects osmosis).<br/>Despite their objections, publicly, the idea of high sodium diets causing high blood pressure was here to stay, and remains today. The Centers For Disease Control, The National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and many other organizations currently promote low sodium diets.<br/>Despite the seemingly unified front presented by these distinguished organizations, the controversy among scientists is extremely heated. In 1998, award winning author Taubes, published “The Political Science of Salt” in the Journal of Science. He stated, “The controversy over the benefits, if any, of salt reduction now constitutes one of the longest running most vitriolic and surreal disputes in all of medicine.”<br/>One surgeon general in a report wrote, the speed with which US federal agencies embraced sodium reduction, “stood in stark contrast to how long it had taken for recommendations to emerge on the importance of reducing blood cholesterol levels”. He also noted that the difference was even more remarkable considering the absence of published research that actually tested the theory. On the flip-side, Sir Micheal Rawlings, the chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, who promotes salt reduction diets argued that, “Guidance (in policy making) is based on the best available evidence. The evidence may not, however, be very good and is rarely complete.” Not a very strong argument for reducing salt intake.<br/>Let’s look at a few relatively recent studies. In 2008, Italian researchers began publishing the results from a series of clinical trials, all of which reported that, among patients with heart failure, reducing salt consumption increased the risk of death. These studies were followed by others which showed among Type 1 and 2 diabetics, healthy Europeans and patients with chronic heart failure, those that ate salt at the lower limit of the normal range were more likely to have heart disease than those who ate salt in the middle range of normal.<br/>In 2011, two Cochrane reviews found no evidence that low salt diets either improved or worsened peoples’ health. They stated, “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.”<br/>Even in the face of no clear scientific evidence to support it and some to the contrary, in 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Society of Hypertension all continued to promote low sodium diets as a means of controlling high blood pressure.<br/>In the end, being a medical professional and someone who needs clear evidence to make a decision about whether I get to add copious amounts of salt on my fries, I am pleased to find that so far there is very little! All the major health organizations seem to promote low sodium diets, but none have actually published consistent studies that show low sodium diets help in health, particularly not in cardiovascular health. What I find most annoying, a pet peeve of mine, is that none of these organizations tell people that the science behind their policies is controversial and they might be flat wrong. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns, and Sandro Galea said it best in their article “Salt And Public Health”- “After a careful consideration of the debate over salt, we have concluded that the concealment of scientific uncertainty is a mistake that serves neither the ends of science nor good policy.”<br/>So you should you go out and smother everything in salt now? As with most things, if science hasn’t been able to answer the question definitively one way or the other, and you want to be safe rather than sorry, just go with the age old rule of “moderation in everything”. If you, like me, like to salt everything like the rim of a margarita glass and moderation be damned, at least now you can feel a little better about it as science seems to be leaning more and more towards low sodium diets being unnecessary and high sodium ones not being harmful at all.<br/>If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below, you might also like:<br/>- Why Salt Enhances Flavor<br/>- What Do the Numbers in a Blood Pressure Test Mean and What Do They Tell the Doctor<br/>- What Causes Arms, Legs, and Feet to “Fall Asleep”<br/>- Top 5 First Aid Tricks Everyone Should Know<br/>- How to Remove a Fresh Carpet Stain with Nothing But Salt<br/>- High blood pressure is neither a disease nor an illness in and of itself. It’s merely a risk factor for other problems. For instance, if you have chronic high blood pressure, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke goes up significantly. This high pressure could be caused by excessive plaque on the inside of your artery walls, making those arteries in effect, smaller. Think plumbing. When the pipes that transport fluid get smaller, the pressure that same volume of fluid exerts goes up. What happens if your blood pressure gets too high? I’ll answer that question with another one. What happens if the water pressure in your houses pipes gets too high? Your pipes burst. Same thing here. Should your blood pressure get too high, your arteries have a greater chance of bursting. If there is too much gunk inside your pipes (plaque inside your arteries), that ball of gunk could get too big and clog off your pipes! Seems bad too me! Especially, if those arteries are in your brain, or heart. It’s not like kidneys, where you have two! You spring a leak in those organs, and your family finally gets that big paycheck from your life insurance policy! Not really the best way to get paid, well, unless you’re really a jerk and everyone in your family hates you! Then they might not mind so much, but you certainly would.<br/>- Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury. For reference, 1 psi (pounds per square inch) is equal to 51.7149326 millimeters of mercury. If you were bleeding and wanted to stop the blood-loss with direct pressure, and you should, you would only need to use about 3 psi to stop it. Unless they have really high blood pressure, then maybe 4 psi. Basic math saves the day again!<br/>- The first known experiment to measure the exact pressure of blood was performed by Stephen Hales on December 1, 1733. He took a live horse. Attached a tube to her left crural artery, then allowed her blood to rush through the tube and it rose to a height of 8’3”. He noted that “when it was at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each pulse 2, 3,or 4 inches”. Yes the horse bled out, but don’t think Mr. Hales was too cruel, he performed the experiment on a horse that was about to be put down anyway! To the horse, I’m sure this distinction didn’t matter much of course. 🙂<br/>*Legal Disclaimer: While I am a medical professional, this article contains general information about medical conditions and treatments.

There, I’ve covered myself.Expand for References<br/>&#124;Share the Knowledge!&#124;<br/>I’m getting more and more convinced that salt does significantly increase my BP. Whenever I eat crisps (chips if you live in the USA) which have a fairly large amount of salt, my BP goes up significantly the next few days.<br/>I tried getting saltless crisps about a week ago and added my own “lo-salt” (a salt substitute consisting of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (salt), but twice as much as the former than the latter).<br/>Anyway the lo-salt flavoured crisps (chips) diodn’t raise my BP at all.<br/>OK I know that further experiments on myself is required. But at the moment I’m strongly suspecting salt as the culprit. I’m also suspect that sugar increases my BP too. But lots of investigation required to establish that!<br/>Maybe you have a poor potassium to sodium balance. My mum has hypertension and was on a low sodium diet but she was not getting enough potassium and her blood pressure was not stable. If you are concerned you may want to have your blood potassium level checked.<br/>Now that she is consuming enough potassium she her blood pressure has been normal for over a year while consuming sodium within normal ranges(more than 2500 mg)<br/>It’s not the sodium…. it’s the fat and starch that is making you fatter and fatter; and that, is you body mass increasing and making it harder for your heart to pump blood through the veins and arteries that get squished in your body by the increased amount of accumulated fat.<br/>you are eating pure bloody starch and pointing to salt instead of the sugar, anything to avoid incrimination of sugar not too mention vegetable oil that increases all causes of death. You get far more osmolality from the sugar<br/>Hard evidence needed? Not a myth and very easy to document — requires little intelligence or training, anyone can do it. At the age of 52-54, this was over a two year period (2005 and 2006). Used a software program (Diet Power 4 — I paid $50 for it but it is now free to download) to track food, sodium, and bicycle exercise time. Produced graphs using the pen and paper method although will do the same thing being the program had no provisions to enter data on blood pressure. A doctor taking a reading every three to six months is absolutely is of no value in my opinion if an effort is not made to take the reading under identical circumstances other than to show a general trend over several years.<br/>I found that to be of any value, for my graph type and hypothesis (now proven), it was necessary to take several readings over a period of at least five minutes or until two close (three or less numerical spread and no more than three bpm on heart rate) readings. I would take note of readings after a two mile walk or an hour of biking at a slow to moderate rate. Wide swings over five minutes quit after I got in physical shape and stayed on the diet. Professional sites recommend sitting down 3 minutes or more and taking more than one reading but I only had one or two doctors in the last twenty years doing that, some over the need to quickly see another patient. A nurse claimed the significant reason for taking blood pressure readings were the insurance companies insisting on it. She claimed some doctors did not look at the readings she took so who cares if an effort was made to get an accurate reading was her conclusion.<br/>Walk in after rushing to show up on time, climbing stairs or whatever, sit down, a nurse grabs your arm and takes your blood pressure. At one time I convinced a doctor to take a second reading after ten minutes of discussing with me my medical problems. He claimed he had seldom waited, a man with 15 years of experience although professional sites recommended waiting three minutes. Another doctor claimed he had never heard of Na effecting blood pressure (he had been an army doctor with different standards for education he claimed).<br/>Now to the results. The graphs were beautiful and showed a perfect coalition between the the five factors entered; food type, sodium amounts, exercise, heart rate, weight.<br/>I had been on blood pressure medicine for ten years with only a numerical change of 5. I also was in sedentary employment and received zero exercise. My weight was at the upper end of normal weight or slightly overweight. I would would eat typical amounts of sodium for Americans (2,000+ mg) over two days. Then various amounts of low sodium for 4 days then gradually increase over a period of several days. After 72+ hours of a low sodium diet and exercise program, my blood pressure would drop significantly. 135/90 to 110/70 over three days was typical after being on my diet plan (the DASH diet) for one month. Sugar levels and high chemical foods were also recorded as part of diet. Sodium intake showed up more than others exercise as the biggest variable. High chemical foods also showed a difference although high chemical foods often have high sodium levels.<br/>Over four day after resuming the DASH diet there would be a significant and gradual change to the upside. It takes two or more days, depending on physical activity and water consumption to dissipate the sodium in your blood is my hypothesis although I have never confirmed this from research.<br/>I suspect sodium levels for proper blood pressure varies between people and different body designs (gender, race, activity, fat vs skinny, exercise level, etc). Many people may have little if any effect from a 2,000 mg vs 600 mg of Na. I’m not one of those. It is estimated cavemen had a diet of 400 to 600mg Na. What was good enough for cavemen (who had short lives for other reasons) was good enough for me.<br/>I had to make an effort to stay at 600 mg because of my diet. The diet I was on was 200 to 400 mg if I did not force myself to use that salt shaker). Sodium is a necessary part of your diet. I found Na amounts over 1000 mg were too much for my body. I have hypertension and heart palpitations with shortness of breath. My thyroid lab readings became perfect and the doctor took me off thyroid medication and blood pressure medication. My heart palliation’s and shortness of breath at 3 to 5 a.m. every night quit after one month. All my problems resumed significantly when I got off my diet plan/exercise in recent years. Of interest one older doctor who had been in the profession for forty years claimed I was only one of two people that went from a TSH level of 0.0 to 4.0 (the upper range of normal) after quitting the medication. Thyroid problems have resumed along with blood pressure, heart and heart palliation’s. I have now resumed the diet and exercise plan and tracking. I’ll send in an update after three months.<br/>I’m only one person, so put 400 people on the same program I’ve been on and see what happens. Problem of course is finding 200 honest people out of that 400 that do not fib on the diet and exercise database or guess. It also takes will power to stick to a program. I stuck with it for ten years then quit for miscellaneous reasons. Remove the ones from the database that show no improvement who refuse to swear under oath and take a lie detector test!<br/>Salt (Sodium) DOES raise your blood pressure. I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 130/90. She told me to control my salt (sodium 1500mg limit) and I had a check up two days later with my blood pressure 108/87. Anytime I eat lots of salty foods, I get a spike in my pressure. I am definitely salt sensitive.<br/>SALT (SODIUM) DOES affect your blood pressure. You have to be careful (it sneaks up on you good) and adjust your diet to limit sodium intake and watch for signs of your pressure raising. Especially when your body behavior changes.<br/>Work out as well! If you are lazy or not that active, take 30 minute walks 5 days a week (150 minutes total) minimum to get a decent exercise.<br/>I think the point is that recommending a lower sodium diet, that maybe affects a specific set of people, those who already have hypertension and are salt sensitive, to an entire population is ridiculous. Another point is whether high salt intake leads to chronic cardiovascular problems, which is being touted as fact to the public but has no research to back it up. I consume way more sodium than the CDC recommends and my BP has never been higher than 117/70, my highest ever, normal about 100-110/65-70. Neither of our cases prove one way or the other the effects “high” sodium intake has on the general population.<br/>You may have low cellular potassium, high copper, low vitamin k2, low magnesium, low vitamin E, heavy metal toxicity such as lead, everyone is exposed to lead and fluoride, these things compound each other.<br/>Look at conditions that cause you to have this salt sensitivity such as low potassium high cortisol.<br/>Don’t just rest on salt because you likely will have multiple issues as well almost no-one just eats salt by itself.<br/>Salt is generally found in high simple sugar no fiber foods with additives.<br/>Understand guidelines are for the whole population not just for you, this is problematic because unrefined salt is not shown to be unhealthy for most people and to some it improves health and in making these guidelines with no recognition of biochemical individuality.<br/>Understand lowering HBP is not the be all and end all, this has been mechanically done by drugs in studies which show no improvement in outcomes and even worsening of symptoms outside of the sign of BP measurement.<br/>Things to consider, Olive leaf extract, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin k2, potassium, curcumin, stevia(the natural sweetener), magnesium, pomegranite, l-arginine, nattokinase, fish oil, cocoa, beetroot, alpha lipoic acid, bromelain, flax seed, celery, coq10, flax seed, hawthorne. All these improve BP and cardiovascular issues. You have a lot more in your toolkit than you think<br/>As for Sugar, women should limit their sugar (Total Carbs is what matters and watch out for certain sugar alcohols) 20g-30g a snack and 30g-45g each meal. Men should keep their snack the same as women 20g-30g a snack and 60g – 75g a meal. The lowest numbers are the lmit for diabetics of course.<br/>I believe that some people have a sensitivity to sodium. I’m convinced that I do. After being on 3 different BP meds at one time and still having uncontrolled hypertension, I started reading food labels and drastically reducing my sodium intake. Most processed foods are loaded with sodium. I have been able to stop 2 meds completely and reduce the third one to 1/4 the prescribed dosage. For me, reducing sodium has made a huge difference. Last night I took 10 mg of lisinopril, which is 1/4 of the prescribed daily dosage. Today my BP is too low, 105/48. I really have to consistently monitor it, as low BP isn’t much fun, either.<br/>Blood pressure drugs are ineffective, they fail to improve outcomes only the BP reading.<br/>You have reduced your intake of low potassium high salt high sugar low fiber junk foods, this was always going to lower your blood pressure.<br/>Salt is not the enemy you just require potassium and antioxidants to balance it out and lower stress.<br/>When people reduce sodium in this way you cant contribute it to salt itself, you have completely altered your dietary intake of many things, this is how people can be fooled into thinking its a single thing.<br/>This attribution of a singular cause to problems is constantly done in hypothesis and they tend to be completely bogus demonizing singular things like Co2, salt, saturated fat, cholesterol, lack of seratonin, even lack of the poison fluorides use.<br/>These are all myths that fail under scrutiny but continue to be upheld as causes by regulating bodies by cherry picking and dismissal of minimization of overwhelming contradictions. The pharmaceutical junk food and vegetable oil corporations benefit and misinform the public for profit to which the FDA racketeers for them killing off their competition.<br/>Medicine research and much of other research is a cesspool of incestuous deception between private interest and boosting the economy as well as politicians doctors and government profit.<br/>The editors of the journals studies are published in find most studies to be entirely lacking, conclusions to be spun towards confirmation bias and that we are in quite a dark age for science where belief, consensus and peer review are less about good science and more about blackballing competing belief and evidence that will damage profits and future grants.<br/>Yea, whatever. Believe what you want. I have been reading health books for years….DECADES…and I’ve have read in them EXACTLY what is printed in this article. There NEVER has been a proven link between salt and high blood pressure. Furthermore, in one of books it pointed out that salt is used to make stomach acid, and it’s ironic that as we age, the low sodium diet so often touted leads to digestive problems.<br/>Keep believing doctors who take 3 credits of Nutrition in college and pitch compounds that cause worse side effects than the actual disease.<br/>Doctors, who say Chiropractic is “not real medicine.” Read the Winsdor papers. A doctor who set out to prove Chiro was fake by doing autopsies found that 99 out of 100 organ failures were due to lack of nerve energy caused by “subluxations” which pinch the nerves and interrupt nerve energy flow. (I’m not a chiropractor).<br/>Go read books by Norman Walker, (especially “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.”), TC Fry, and Herbert M. Shelton (Superior Nutrition, Fasting can save your life). I’ve read them all.<br/>BOTTOM LINE this is an excellent article and I’m actually surprised to see the truth so openly posted in an article like this…but you believe what you want & take chemicals pushed by the medical profession…eat what you want, drink what you want, don’t exercise and when things go wrong just take a pill….<br/>I attempted to look up these “Winsdor Papers” and even Google doesn’t know what you are talking about. If you really want to win people over, you should actually post links to the information you want us to read.<br/>Guys you all are missing one point: sodium is poisonous to us. Even if does not raise BP, its still poison ;/ not good at all<br/>@Marco: You would die instantly without sodium in your body.<br/>I am not the same Marco as Mr. “Salt is poison”. Just to be clear<br/>Of course – everything in excess is bad – heck, even drinking too much water will kill you.<br/>Now, every person is different so you have to find what works for you. Mine, I like salted 🙂<br/>This article is misleading. Just because salt’s negative effect on blood pressure is a “theory” doesn’t mean we should ignore it. In fact most of medicine and science is carried out on plausible theories. The truth is a low salt diet is less harmful than a high salt diet and like all things the real moral of the story is moderation. Also this author contradicts themselves by saying there is “no evidence… Yes none” to support this theory, but then goes on to cite at least one study that shows the negative corrolatuon in humans and another involving rats. That’s evidence, at least some not none. Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that. Sure sometimes we are far from knowing but in this case there’s enough science behind salts impact on BP to make it worth considering. Also remember the human consumption of high salt quantities is a fairly new thing on the evolutionary scale, so it’s impact on our bodies is fairly unnatural.<br/>@Mike: “No evidence… Yes none” I think Scott is meaning “No reputable evidence” Or, rather, “No evidence that is not flawed.”<br/>“Everything in moderation” Yep, exactly. As Scott is fond of saying, “Even water will kill you in high enough doses.” He even once told me a story of a woman he attempted to treat for this very thing- she drank massive amounts of water and ended up dying from it.<br/>“Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that.” I don’t think any doctors would ever say that. Maybe a century or two ago. But there is an amazing amount of good science involved here these days. We are far from knowing everything, but it’s certainly not black magic or just guess work, as that would seem to imply.<br/>Sorry to disagree with you Dave. But even on the sources of the video, the rise of blood pressure on high-salt diets is evident. While in the end of one of them, while talking about softdrinks and snacks companies:<br/>“Some of these companies have been preeminent in trying to create an artificial controversy doubting the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure,16,17 presumably in the hope of stopping or slowing down any reduction in population salt intake to protect soft drink sales.”<br/>Even, I’m not a specialist in the area, the lacks of a literature review in source about this matter is disturbing.<br/>oh diets that are processed foods with low fat high sugar high additive, observational studies are meaningless, these people are eating copious amounts of sugar each year. If you think corporations are trying to be allowed to use more salt its ridiculous distraction in doing anything to not look at the sugar metabolism syndrome epidemic.<br/>How moronic that you think observational studies matter for anything other than proposing a hypothesis, you then use intervention and double-blind placebo studies with no variables to prove them causal. THIS IS NOT DONE, this is also not done for cholesterol or saturated fat. You are a gullible victim of pathological science, when he says there is no evidence there is no evidence observational studies do no control for anything they are not an experiment, this is not how science works. You do understand cochrane are perhaps the most neutral group for clinical study in the world and they reviewed 150 trials and 13 population studies. Here you are saying their findings are wrong based on what? nothing other than your belief based on a hypothesis with no evidence.<br/>I suggest you read the book “Salt”. It is mostly a geopolitical historical account of salt in our civilization, but it also has a good deal of science in it. We built our civilization on salt.<br/>The first paragraph says ” just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence,” I believe that since this is a scientific minded website it shouldn’t use the word theory in this context, since in science, a theory is an accepted explanation of a phenomenon, proven by testing.<br/>Yeah, he should have used hypothesis. I’m going to have to look up the history of theory and see if anyone knows how it ended up with two such different meanings.<br/>For a medical professional (which leads to an assumption of advanced education), you have a horrible grasp of grammar and spelling. This discredits much of what you say, in my mind. Having someone else review your work before publishing would go a long way.<br/>I will continue to listen to my cardiologist on this matter and limit my salt intake.<br/>@Mark: Something you’ll find seemingly true about a large number of medical professionals, the stereotype of their handwriting being horrible is generally correct. (Scott’s is particularly bad.) And their technical writing can also sometimes be particularly terrible, pre-edit. (They study medicine and the human body, not writing, after all) But, in over 100+ articles Scott has written, he has never been shown to be wrong on a main point (and only a few cases of being wrong on a minor point). Typos? Awkward sentence? You will always find at least one of these in each of his articles, despite my sincerest efforts to get rid of them all. But in the end, I care about accuracy much more than grammar. Both would be good, but finding a writer of Scott’s particular expertise and ability to think critical and process vast amounts of medical knowledge is extremely difficult. These people aren’t a dime a dozen. 🙂<br/>But really, the strength of Scott’s arguments are never based on his extensive medical knowledge. That just helps him thoroughly vet the various studies on the subject where most would get lost in the terminology, let alone be able to think critically about them and their methodology. The strength of the argument is the studies themselves. In this one, you’d do well to actually read the two Cochrane reviews, and perhaps forward them to your cardiologist for his/her thoughts.<br/>Don’t be surprised if he/she has already ready them though, and maybe even agrees with them. What doctors tell their patients doesn’t always line up with what they actually know or believe to be true. Particularly in cases like this where lawsuits may be a very real possibility if they told you to eat all the salt you wanted, then you died of a heart issue (but having nothing to do with the salt), then your family sues them and cites what various government agencies say on the subject, rather than what the medical world actually thinks. 🙂 Watching your sodium isn’t likely to hurt either, but covers the cardiologists’ backside. (I actually had an interesting discussion about this with Scott just last night about a doctor he was discussing this with who said something very similar as to why despite that he knows sodium isn’t going to be harmful in this way, he still tells certain of his patients to watch their sodium intake.)<br/>In the end, as I always say, “Question everything,” but also when questioning, do the research to find the answers too, and then double check that research just to make sure. 🙂 And, maybe don’t make the mistake of equating grammar and writing ability with knowledge of a subject or intelligence. I’ve worked with a ton of writers. I can say, journalists (and other such people with a writing background) are great at writing… They almost all are horrid at research, which surprised me on the journalists, but maybe explains a lot about the state of media reporting on scientific studies. Funny enough, the best combo of writing ability and research seems to be lawyers. They are phenomenal at both in my experience. Scientists, or people with a science background, tend to be poor at writing, but incredible at research and critical thinking. Of course, that’s only going with a sample-size of a few dozen writers I’ve worked with, and there is one exception I’ve found in that, but it’s a trend I’ve observed.<br/>I think everyone must be different. For me salt raises my blood pressure a lot. I check the bl pr 4-6x a day. Stays low enough when i stay under 300 mg of salt. As soon as i eat a lot of salt, like chinese food or even a meat and cheese sub or two slices of pizza my bl pr goes to 170/98. It takes a couple days to get the salt out of my body. Then it will go down to 130/80 and sometimes a bit lower. I am 67.<br/>you just offered up things containing large amounts of simple carbohydrates, also containing wheat. Sugar has high osmolality but is ignored due to the weight applied to salt<br/>Dietary wheat elimination alone can lower bp by 20-40 mmHG. The company life extension says this also beneficially optimizes blood lipid profiles.<br/>Do you see how you are perhaps basing what you see on assumption based on what you have been told based on the hypothesis that has no evidence.<br/>cardiovascular issues in observational studies only found a correlation with people eating the very large amount of 5 grams of salt a day, you can imagine what amount of junk foods they are eating to attain this amount.<br/>If your problem is salt you have an underlying condition causing it because you are not getting a high amount in any way, however you are also ignoring other causes which is the problem when singular things are touted as the main contributing factor when no evidence suggests they are the cause.<br/>consider your cellular potassium, copper, lead exposure, magnesium, vitamin E intake, coq10 levels, irritants and stress that can increase coagulation and vessel constriction.<br/>If I may comment on the whole spelling/grammar controversy… in my experience from observing people, the populace (at least the intelligent ones, my whole family is high IQ and my husband is a genius, literally, and as I have no lower-intelligence friends for a control group, I can only speak from my observations of my family and husband’s family,) is divided into two types: math-people and word-people. My father was a math person, as was I when I was very small, however, I lived with my mother, who is most definitely a words person, my whole life, leading to my developing into a words person. My husband may very well be the smartest person I’ve ever met, but from his spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, you’d never know it. He’s a computer repair tech, can fix anything, highly versatile in his job abilities, can solve algebra problems that I’m struggling with for minutes at a time with just a glance, but can’t spell our son’s name.<br/>As far as I can tell, scientists tend to be math people more than word people. (Just for the record, one of my previous jobs was research, and I’m a grammar Nazi and sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>I was wondering if I could ask the author of this article for a small favor.<br/>At the beginning I read this sentence in regard to salt intake:<br/>“But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize [it is just a theory] and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence…”<br/>Here you are using “Theory” in its popular parlance. WHich is fine and all. The problem is that this is a scientific related article and when a theory is not supported by evidence we call it a “Hypothesis”.<br/>Those of us that write in the scientific realm should make an effort to make this distinction, mostly because the next time I get some Young Earth Creationist telling me evolution is “just a theory” I swear I am going to start jumping up and down like a Chimpanzee and make backward sammerault. Then I’ll throw feces at him/her.<br/>I am sure you don’t want such a scene to become reality. Heck, you probably don’t want to think it up in your mind.<br/>So let’s start a campaign to call a Theory a “a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena” and call anything that is meant to be pulled from one’s rear orifice an “Hypothesis”.<br/>BTW: I know the dictionary return both meanings. FOr the sake of Science, let’s change the meaning back since we already have a good working word for “I just pulled this out of my ass”.<br/>@Marco: That’s a good point. I’ll start working that distinction in to future articles. 🙂<br/>Not a single legitimate conclusion can be drawn from a single blood pressure measurement. BP varies widely even from moment to moment. I have many times seen 160/100 drop to 130/75 over the course of a few minutes. As well, BP measuring equipment is highly variable and susceptible to wide variations from things like cuff size and user variations.<br/>Any conclusions drawn from a few measurements are nothing more than speculation and wishful thinking.<br/>First, this is not a peer-reviewed journal article. I agree, the correct use of “theory” has been obfuscated by the colloquial “just a hunch” version. But, let’s move on, ok?<br/>I don’t get that the article is in the least bit misleading. I do get that the author makes the point that apparently is lost on many — “As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.”<br/>He also mentions to think critically. So, if you don’t believe him, a) continue with your belief, or b) find out for yourself. Do the legwork. Read the articles. Now you have a starting point. Thank him for that.<br/>In my opinion, focusing on the occasional grammatical error or “theory vs. hunch” debate unnecessarily diminishes the author’s intent. My takeaway is that this article helps challenge my assumptions about what I thought was already scientifically concluded. I learned something. That’s the point.<br/>@Michael Stelly I am not sure if you were referring specifically to my post in regard to the usage of “theory”, but I assure you that my comment was not intended to criticize the writer at all. At least not in the same terms as a grammatical or spelling “error”.<br/>My comment is not about an “error” rather it is a suggestion that those of us that read and write about science do our part to reclaim the usage of the word “theory” from the mainstream or that at least we try.<br/>There are those that comment on obvious spelling errors and I agree they are not important in the context of the information provided in the article (although I agree they can be distracting and I am speaking from a non native English speaker), but unless their number and character is such that they make understanding the article difficult or even impossible, you won’t find me posting about them.<br/>The word “theory” on the other hand is a word that is being actively used by certain factions of the science / religion discussion to discount 200 years of scientific advancement and it is being actively used to mislead children into discounting science as a whole.<br/>If you have watched the Nye – Ham debate, Gawker asked some creationists to write a question to evolution supporters on a piece of paper and they published these questions in the form of pictures. Invariably the “it’s just a theory” question appeared.<br/>It’s in that spirit that I have asked the curators of this website to try to use the word in its scientific meaning. If we in the science and technical fields don’t do that, we cannot expect those that want to distort science for their objectives to do it on their own.<br/>So, with all due respect, I won’t take your advice. I will certainly let slide silly spelling errors but this is important to me and it should be important to all of us that love science.<br/>no one distorts science more than evolutionists, inference and speculation based on an assumption of fact are not evidence. No field has as many hoaxes and assumptions as evolution.<br/>Continuing to use the flawed contrasting argument and assumption that because creation must be wrong evolution must be true is not science, the evidence does not show macroevolution to be possible at this point under any of the many current competing theories based solely on mutation and natural selection. I would suggest another mechanism must be found.<br/>As it stands contradictory evidence is completely ignored or even claimed as evidence of a more complex process but still a proof of evolution when it is no such thing in all cases.<br/>We currently have evidence for abiogenesis that it is an absolute fact as is microevolution absolutely correct, however, in terms of macroevoltuion I would suggest science returned to being based on evidence not an assumption of fact and skewing of data to induce it too fit the theory.<br/>As it stands evolution is not science it is a belief much like the big bang theory which has massive conflicting evidence that in the past when people used evidence to prove or disprove theories this theory would have been shelved, the combination of both these theories is akin to a religion, the religion of secular humanists. It is as political as they come the communities that uphold these beliefs black ball and ad hominem they cannot stand on the evidence but on intimidation. Studies show ad hominem is as useful as reasoned argument, this is used by illigitamate science suche as Co2 based climate alarmism and macroevolution which currently do not have evidence in their favor yet use the same types of propaganda and attacks suggesting anyone opposing them is anti-science or a moron.<br/>I suggest reading http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>People who do not agree with evolution don’t automatically believe creation, the evolutionist always attacks and distracts from their own weak argument creates their own strawman of what others believe and assume based on their own often moronic assumptions that they are backed by evidence when they are not.<br/>One fact I would like to add:<br/>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are another piece of evidence in this controversy. Interestingly, thiazides are called diuretics but when taken daily this diuretic effect becomes almost zero. After a period of chronic thiazide therapy, the primary benefit these medications provide is that they increase the elimination of sodium and chloride ions from the blood by way of the Na/Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule (along with other effects such as retention of calcium). Despite losing the diuretic effect thiazides retain their blood pressure lowering effects long-term and are one of the medications used first line for lowering blood pressure. This lowering effect is generally attributed to the elimination of sodium and seems to be in line with the idea that high sodium levels do increase blood pressure.<br/>Believe it or not. Salt appears to lower my BP. If I eat too many chips I actually get dizzy from low BP. Can’t say I get it.<br/>This “theory” is simply stupid. Salt DOES increase blood pressure big time! It’s a fact, observed, monitored. Accidentally eat some pretty salty stuff one day than needed a week of diuretics to get rid of all that salt from the body and bring the blood pressure from 190-200 (!!yes, that high it got!!!) back to normal (120-130). So don’t tell stories which aren’t true.<br/>Not all people respond the same to dietary salt. My suggestion for us is to take note of the sodium level in our normal lab results in minimal annual physicals.<br/>From childhood, I am used to take more salt with my meals, but never faced the problem of High BP, instead sometimes it goes below normal. I Googled this problem & came to the conclusion that my body needs salt more than normal to compensate for genetically transmitted ‘Low BP’ problem. So? Your Brain is the instructor for your health. You must follow its orders to stay Really Healthy!<br/>Well, I’m just a nutritionist (like a University Nutrition major that will be graduating in May) and maybe what I learnt is bull, but after being thought about the pathophysiology of how sodium can impact blood pressure, I find that the recommendation makes sense, but you would need to do more than just cut sodium. One thing that’s important is the sodium: potassium ratio (ie you eat a bunch of high processed, sodium added foods compared to fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables). I’ll admit that not everyone is salt sensitive and that we have consciously decided, in the health field, to assume that everyone is because testing for salt-sensitiveness (if that’s a word!) is expensive, long, and impractical. But the idea that there is no good plausible evidence linking salt and hypertension is false. Here’s just 6 articles. These aren’t the ones that were given by our professors to read (though if you want me to find them for you I’m sure I can), but they’re good one’s nonetheless and you don’t need a special University code or membership to access them. Anyways, here you go in case you want to read more:<br/>Do any of those show that there’s a correlation without other factors? You say “you would need to do more than just cut sodium”… is there evidence that doing those other actions without cutting sodium doesn’t work as well as cutting sodium too?<br/>Did you not read? Cochrane used 150 trials and 13 studies right? so you have 6, this is your “education” at work. Brainwashing and then confirmation biased search for support of the faulty hypothesis that has been found to be not of high quality already.<br/>If Cochrane did not use it it is not a high quality article, if it did then the support was not significant in the article. The osmolality mechanism applies to high sugar diets yet its all about salt<br/>The problem here is low quality studies are published constantly that people infer causation from where they can’t possibly do so as they did not control all the variables.<br/>The same thing is done for the lipid hypothesis and the cholesterol hypothesis.<br/>These are also myths, cholesterol from all data is inversely related to heart disease slightly.<br/>Statins absolute risk reduction for heart disease is 1.4% this is hardly significant, statins effects for decreasing heart problems in those already having a heart attack may be entirely due to their effect as an anticoagulant. Once again pathological junk science is being used to push treatments without recognizing mechanisms and variables. Most people will be harmed by inhibiting vitamin k coq10 and cholesterol synthesis via statins yet doctors backed by pharmaceutical greed promote giving them to everyone.<br/>Saturated fat has no mechanism via which it can raise cholesterol, no study of oil replacement purely substituted fat for oil in double blinds controls all variables and the closer they come to doing so the worse the outcomes for PUFA intervention becomes increasing all causes of death.<br/>Like is said the trials are low quality there is not much will to overturn hypothesis that regulating bodies and doctors have a religious belief in that is not backed by evidence. This misinformation leads to poor health and pharmaceutical profit.<br/>I have been torn between to eat more salt or not, because eating more salt reduces my heart rate and BP and makes me sleep better; my hands and feet feel full and warm. My sweat volume increase as I bike or walk. But then after taking it for a week or 2 then I notice that BP becomes persistently high; which makes me feel I did wrong by eating. What this article mentions is fluid volume increase which is interesting. Before increasing my salt intake my fingers feel thin. Maybe after fluid levels feel normal cut back on salt to normal levels. So I am just hypothesizing that people who have are salt sensitive have good fluid volume and should watch salt intake, others can take salt but stop when it feels full. Basically use salt maintain fluid volume.<br/>Based on self-experimentation, I think maintaining fluid volume is very important. At times, I find that I feel thirsty and drink water and that it keeps coming out; that calls for some salt intake. Basically, I do not eat canned food or much fast foods, my salt intake is what is purposely added in cooking. After exercise, (eating by the book and working out etc cause problems too) I notice that when I stand up from sitting position, I feel dizzy but not normally. I think I may be sweating out salt and , of course, I drink a lot of water during the exercise. I am not proposing eating more salt. What I am stating is the way the body is telling you that your salt is depleted is when you are not feeling full in your feet and hands. I think this is correct to some extent, as the body works more on concentration of things than the absolute amounts. It is not a comprehensive theory as there are other things that may increase blood volume, you may be already having too much salt in blood etc. For the record, my sodium in the blood is always near the low end of the range so my err wont push me outside of the range.<br/>Ok what is the conclusion? do I use the salt shaker now or not? I have been holding too long.<br/>I think this article is irresponsible in that salt absolutely does raise bp in those who have a salt sensitivity. If I eat something very salty I can literally go into hypertensive crisis in a matter of an hour.<br/>This type of sensitivity is common and to not mention it (because it does not fit with the authors theory?) is dangerous.<br/>@Jim porter: “because it does not fit with the authors theory?” The “author’s theory” doesn’t exist. That’s really not what we do here. This is an article simply writing about scientific studies on the topic and saying what they say, so you don’t have to sift through them and all the medical jargon; we do it for you- essentially what we write about reflects the current state of human knowledge on the subject at hand. If it changes at some point, we update the article. In this case, however, most notably the two Cochrane reviews are pretty convincing: “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.” There are exceptions to every rule, and seemingly you are one and that’s very interesting if so and it would be interesting to learn the root cause. But, again, we look at what the scientific studies say and try to reflect that in what we write. Essentially we write a form of “light-reading” style entertaining survey papers on subjects, rather than write research papers.<br/>Stressing about salt will likely kill you long before salt itself will. Do what makes you happy and you will likely live longer than otherwise; and even if you don’t, at least you’ll enjoy the time you have.<br/>I believe the problem is when salt is mixed with fat and THAT causes high blood pressure. For example, someone talked about theirs rising when eating crisps/chips-that’s because the chips contain fat. The same would apply say to french fries or other fatty dishes. However, if you were to sprinkle salt on something like fruit, it wouldn’t have the same effect and not raise your blood pressure.<br/>I do think sodium gets a bad rap and some people actually do consume too little. I think having salt with fruit or salads is o.k. but the problem is the salt/fat combination and if you think about it, that’s where people usually get their salt-in potato chips, french fries, heavily seasoning meats, in creamy dishes, etc.<br/>The person who wrote this article adds nothing of value to the discussion about high blood pressure except to encourage people to stick their heads in the sand.<br/>I have been wrestling with high blood pressure for about 12 years since a serious accident caused me to be physically inactive for about a year after the accident.<br/>High blood pressure can be controlled with and without medications and individuals respond differently to different treatments and there are natural cures for this affliction.<br/>High blood pressure can cause strokes, brain hemmorhages and contribute to diabetes and kidney disease.<br/>The balance between potassium and sodium in our blood is very critical and unfortunately most doctors don’t have a clue about the effect that nutrition and proper hydration has on this condition.<br/>Most of the doctors I have been to just give out prescriptions which may or may not work.<br/>There are natural substances which have enabled me to lower my blood pressure within a few days from extremely high to almost normal while doctors and pharmacists will say that medications (like Cozaar and Norvasc)may take up to a month to work.<br/>I’ve found that the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water<br/>had significant effects.<br/>Drinking this once or twice per day has had a very significant effect in my case; my blood pressure went from 220/95 to 130/90 within 3 days.<br/>Garlic (deodorized) also helps and fruit or vegetable juices with lowered salt content and high potassium content also help. (V-8 low salt or V-8 green).<br/>This is not wishful thinking; it has to do with chemistry; this doesn’t mean that everyone will respond the same to these treatments but I disagree very strongly when someone says that salt has no effect<br/>on blood pressure.<br/>This seems to me to be irresponsible and cavalier, unless of course you work for one of the salt manufacturers.<br/>Salt is necessary and most table salts have iodine in them, which is an essential nutrient for humans.<br/>Drinking sufficient amounts of pure water is also very important; something that my doctors never bothered to mention.<br/>This enables the body to rid itself of excess salt and helps the body cleanse itself.<br/>There are many natural substances and some foods (like pesto) which can help lower blood pressure and you can find many posts on the internet about them.<br/>Web Md and The Mayo Clinic both have posts on the subject and I trust them a hell of alot more than the author of this post.<br/>This appears to me to be an exercise in defending the indefensible.<br/>To what purpose?<br/>Who was Hippocrates anyway and what the hell did he know?<br/>I have extremely low blood pressure. If I stand up too fast, I’ll faint flat on my face. My doctor told me to eat as much salt as I want, no worries.<br/>In any case, I’ll take all of this advice with a pinch of… you know what. ;-D<br/>I eat a lot of salt (and I do mean a *LOT*). A few years ago after getting fed up with constantly being told how bad this is, I decided to put it to the test. As a Ph.D. I know how to scientifically plan a test, and over several months minimizing as many variables as possible, I tested my blood pressure while at my regular salt intake versus low salt intake. The results were pretty much as expected, although some people /may/ be slightly intolerant to relatively high levels of salt intake, for me there was no difference at all. I have returned to eating food the way I like it (salty), and tell anybody who advises against this they simply don’t know what they are talking about LOL<br/>I’m 27 female. I started having high blood pressure while I was taking Accutane a year and a half ago (Accutane increases cholesterol buildup). What I experienced was intense, my pulse was at 120bpm, I was dizzy, my hands clamped up into an unusual claw shape and they tingled until they lost feeling. I thought I was actually dying. I was told it was just a panic attack, but I’ve never had any real anxiety issues. I was given oxygen for an entire hour when suddenly I started craving salt. I asked my friend to run to mcdonalds and get me some extra salty fries. Within minutes of eating all that salt, my blood pressure was back to normal, my hands got their feeling back, and I could walk and breath normally again.<br/>I find the things that trigger it the most for me are a lack of sleep, not eating anything all day, corn, wheat, and chemical salts such as MSG. But sea salt and normal table salt don’t make it worse, they make it better! With that said, I’ve always had blood test results showing high levels of potassium. Could this somehow be involved? My Dr. Just shrugs it off as caused by my love for potatoes and citrus fruits lol<br/>You might need a new doctor high potassium or hyperkalemia can cause the episodes you describe and Accutane can cause hyperkalemia.<br/>Potassium and sodium are obviously related as your cells constantly exchange these into and out of cells to maintain higher intracellular concentrations of potassium.<br/>Cortisol which raises with sleep deprivation, not eating and other stresses reverses this process of potassium concentration into the cell, but is meant to increase potassium excretion, cellular uptake of sodium absorption and sodium retention in the kidneys, there may be something going wrong with this process with potassium not being excreted. The normal reason is the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system which regulates blood pressure.<br/>Salt nourishes adrenals but you might want to get some more vitamin C which is concentrated there as well as in the pituitary gland as these regulate your cortisol and vit c lowers cortisol and stress likely lessening the severity of episodes.<br/>Things to look into, magnesium, vitamin e, adrenal glandular, copper/zinc levels, kidney and adrenal function.<br/>Pharmacist here. Thank you for all the helpful comments on this site. One can see all the intelligently written posts from people who have reduced their high blood pressure by limiting salt. I am one of these people. My blood pressure a year ago was running on average 180/120 when not medicated, and when on 3 different medications, on average 140/90. After feeling awful, either from adverse effects from the meds or from headaches from high blood pressure, I decided to alter my diet. The results I achieved were stunning. Blood pressure perfectly normal, 120/80. No headaches, or feeling like my throat was swollen, or feeling like my head was too hot….I could go on and on. I did this with NO expensive products. I just, as much as is possible nowadays in the U.S., ate non-processed foods, and avoided all added salt. Notice, all “added” salt. As many have correctly pointed out, salt is necessary to human life. And many foods naturally contain all the salt we need, so it is not necessary to add any. Listening to these supposed experts, I wonder how any humans ever survived 10,000 years ago if they weren’t lucky enough to find a salt block to lick every day! I read one comment about someone who has had good results from “the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water”. I would challenge him and others to just try the lemon juice with water. I find that if I clean myself out with just one glass of lemon-water once a week, it has had a splendid effect on my health. The other ingredients may help, but it would be an interesting experiment for you. So I, like, many, many others, am sensitive to salt. Maybe some people can eat a huge amount of salt on a regular basis with no adverse health effects. That is not true for many of us, and it is offensive when so called “professionals” or “scientists” dispute this. One thing I always tell my patients, “When it comes to your health, trust yourself above all others”. If you are convinced a particular medication is making you feel sick, and your doctor or pharmacist imply it’s all in your head, trust yourself, not them. If you, like me, feel a thousand times better when you limit your consumption of salt or processed foods, then please, keep doing what you are doing, and don’t listen to those who suggest otherwise! You will be healthier and happier. Thanks for listening, my friends from far away.<br/>While it’s certainly possible that you are salt sensitive, when you decided to alter your diet, you changed many other things in addition to how much salt you ate. Two of the easiest ways to lower blood pressure without altering salt are 1. lose weight. 2. eat more veggies and fruits (aka foods rich in potassium). Numerous clinical and observational studies have shown that the sodium-potassium ratio is likely more important than how much sodium you eat. [Note that this only applies to the 99.999999% of humanity who eats between 3k and 6k mgs of sodium a day. Salt probably is a problem if you’re eating way out of the normal range, like 12,000mg + of sodium a day.]<br/>I was going to basically say the same thing. I had high blood pressure… I did a 30 day Paleo Challenge… All clean from the earth foods. I actually increased my salt intake by introducing a lot of salty beef jerky and pickled food into my diet for snacking. Not only did my blood pressure end up near perfect… I also lost 16 pounds. I wasn’t even someone you would really consider over weight to begin with… 178 lbs to 162 lbs in 30 days. My weird headaches were gone… the whole nine yards that come with high blood pressure. I’m convinced the salt and blood pressure are not related… and I think its a cop out to people who really need to get on an actual healthy diet.<br/>This article is dangerous and might convince someone to use all the salt they want. But all I have to do is eat a couple of big bags of Potato chips and I am getting 180/90 within a couple of days, stay off the salt then for 3-4 days and hydrate well, back to 130/70. Now “maybe” I am hypersensitive, but since this has repeated a half dozen times, I avoid salt. There is plenty in normal foods/<br/>Looks like you dont know what you are talking about… read Curt Nicol DD PhD entry below. and read again this article… you’ve been biased by exposure to the doctors who got biased by years and years of all the yada..yada..yada… read the article again. Of course, you are not going to start eating salt by the pound… everything would taste awful anyway.<br/>What is dangerous is advice and treatments with no scientific basis based on hypothesis alone, the collateral effect of reducing most peoples regular salt intakes is eating less processed food containing huge amounts of refined or simple carbs, highly oxidation prone oils, denatured substances, contaminants and additives.<br/>Reducing these will lead to improved overall nutrition.<br/>Limiting salt on its own with no other variables will show little to no effect in most people and can be detrimental to others.<br/>Me to. I’ve entered a detail comment of stop and start tests that 100% proved my hypothesis that Na was one of the large contributors to blood pressure. Takes an effort to document and record methods and result. Mine was as high as 205/115. I got it down to a consistent 100/65 for two years. My work is documented in this comment section but has yet to show up.<br/>A lot of people here saying that eating a bag of chips increases their blood pressure. Do they not realize it isn’t a health food? Do they think it possibly doesn’t contain all the wrong stuff?<br/>There has to be some other high sodium food they can use to show how salt affects their blood pressure.<br/>That’s right… what is bad is the oil and grease that is going the the pipes and constraining them… plus potato chips, it’s all starch, which turns to sugar, then fat …<br/>I would not be credulous enough to think for a minute, that salt is NOT related to high blood pressure, and increased body temperatures, for it certainly DOES. I reduced my 160 over 80 blood pressure down to 119 over 81 in a few weeks by cutting my salt intake severely. Why is it everytime I eat a several servings of potato chips, or eat Mc Donald’s french fries, I get immediately face flushed and feverish? I have even felt and heard, yes, the constricted veins in my own head, after having high blood pressure, dilate, expand, and break open again,after drinking cups, and cups of water, with the disappearance of the fever, disappearance of discomfort or congested head feeling, and reduced blood pressure.<br/>This really bothers me, and I have t confess to being somewhat confused now. I LOVE salt and can consume more in a single meal than you are supposed to consume in a day. It never seemed to affect my b.p.<br/>Then when my b.p. started increasing as I got older, my doc said to cut out salt. So I did…with no real effect. I was actually admitted into hospital with a serious infection, only to find that when I was discharged, I had been kept on a low sodium diet, even though on admission, my sodium level was dangerously low.<br/>This all made me believe that the dangers of sodium were only a myth, at least for me anyway. But then my wife got ill. Her b.p. was being constantly monitored as it kept going too low. They used to inject her with “sodium” (salty water I believe) and her blood pressure would come up almost immediately. This was intravenously however.<br/>So is it that I’m not salt-sensitive, or is it something about the stomach that acts a s barrier (so ingested salt does not affect you), while IV salt will?<br/>For something that is so fundamental in medical advice, it is so frustrating that there seems to be so little research, at least quality research done on it.<br/>Conversely, on a later admission to hospital, they had me on low sodium again (once and idiot puts it on your medical records, it seems impossible to get it off…) and gave me a blood pressure reducing medication. My b.p. dropped through the floor and was worrying them at one stage.<br/>BP medications are not evidenced to improve outcomes or be safe in most situations. Modern medicine is quite dangerous they kill people constantly with what they prescribe.<br/>Your wife may have kidney and adrenal problems while you more likely have vascular problems. Consider the possible environmental causes, you drink water with fluoride that increases absorption of lead, lack of antioxidants like ala, vit a/e/c/d/k2 can lead to increased oxidative stress arterial sclerosis and calcification of arteries restricting the ability of vessals to dialate, increased irritant exposure raises vasoconstriction and coagulation by increased seratonin release and lower amounts of nitric oxide produced by endothelial damage, low vitamin c leads to lessened collagen synthesis as does raised cortisol levels, both lead to poor circulation.<br/>These things can cause problems anywhere.<br/>I just spent an hour writing up a comment. My doctor wishes to see it. I doe not show up. What is going on? Did I waste my time? Please respond.<br/>Excellent article. Articles of this type bring out the health nutters and know-it-alls….just take a look at the comments. This also reminds me of the “global warming”….”climate change” (or whatever they are calling it this week) “experts” who preach it like it was gospel when they too have no definitive proof. | Факт или мит: Натриумот го зголемува крвниот притисок<br/>Па, Мет, се покажа дека исхраната со високо ниво на натриум не го зголемува крвниот притисок, ниту пак има негативен ефект врз кардиоваскуларното здравје. Но, ќе ја покријам теоријата за тоа зошто солта го зголемува крвниот притисок подолу - само сфатете дека тоа е само теорија и дека не е поддржана од голем дел од цврстите научни докази (и има повеќе докази кои велат дека тоа не е така отколку што е).<br/>Дебатата за јадење премногу сол е околу од 1960. Речиси секоја голема владина здравствена организација ја прифаќа идејата дека јадењето премногу сол е штетно за вашето здравје. Повеќето големи медиуми известуваат за овие препораки и луѓето имаат тенденција да се обидат да ги следат. Ова е најверојатно зошто повеќето од нас, особено постарите со срцеви проблеми, знаат да ја намалат количината на сол што ја јадеме. Оние од нас кои ја сакаат идејата дека секоја препорака е поддржана со цврсти докази, мора да се повлечат на оваа. Како што рековме, во моментов нема цврсти докази дека солта хронично ќе го зголеми крвниот притисок. Да, нема.<br/>Па зошто повеќето здравствени организации ја туркаат идејата за диета со ниско ниво на натриум? Теоријата зад нивната претпоставка е здрава, а постојат и некои студии кои покажуваат мал ризик од покачен крвен притисок со исклучително висок внес на сол. За жал, постојат многу други студии кои не покажуваат зголемување, а сепак некои кои покажуваат намалување на внесот на сол може всушност да го зголеми вашиот крвен притисок! Ајде да ја разгледаме контроверзијата подетално.<br/>Идејата дека солта ќе го зголеми крвниот притисок е поврзана со осмотскиот притисок. Осмоза е движење на растворувачот (во овој случај вода) низ полупропустливи мембрани (како клеточни ѕидови), од области со пониска концентрација на раствори (во овој случај сол) до области со повисока концентрација на раствори. Ова природно ја изедначува концентрацијата на раствор на двете страни на мембраната. (Овој осмотски притисок е исто така причината зошто солта може да се користи за зачувување на месото.)<br/>Значи, теоријата вели дека кога јадеме премногу сол, нашиот крвоток има повеќе натриум во него од околните области на нашето тело. Ова предизвикува водата во тие области да се повлече во нашиот крвоток. Зголемувањето на водата во артериите и вените предизвикува зголемување на притисокот во тие артерии и вени. Самата сол, исто така, делува како иритант во артериите што ги предизвикува да се стеснат. Исто така, се смета дека го зголемува вашиот крвен притисок.<br/>Теоријата изгледа, на површината, многу звучна. На крајот на краиштата, можеме да го направиме процесот на влечење на солената вода низ мембраните да се случи одново и одново во лабораторијата. Прашањето е, дали ова навистина се случува во нашите тела, и дали тоа всушност предизвикува долгорочна хипертензија (висок крвен притисок)?<br/>Во 1969 година, Луис Дал сведочел пред сенаторот Џорџ МекГоверн во „изборната комисија за исхрана и човечки потреби“. Тој бил загрижен за високите концентрации на натриум во храната за бебиња и мислел дека ова може да предизвика долгорочно зголемување на крвниот притисок кај луѓето. Неговото мислење било дека студиите направени врз стаорци покажале зголемување на крвниот притисок кај стаорците.<br/>Разговорот за сол и хипертензија почна да циркулира меѓу здравствените организации. Националните институти за здравство, во 1972 година, почнаа да ги воведуваат "образовните програми за висок крвен притисок". Како доказ, тие истакнаа набљудувачки, популациите кои јаделе многу малку натриум имале ниски случаи на висок крвен притисок. Тие исто така посочиле на моделирање на стаорци. Научниците во тоа време го доведоа во прашање ова, бидејќи студиите за стаорци ги натераа да јадат 60 пати повеќе од просечното лице. Тие, исто така, истакнаа дека популациите кои јаделе диета со ниско ниво на натриум, исто така јаделе ниски количини на други работи, како што е шеќер (кој исто така влијае на осмозата).<br/>И покрај нивните приговори, јавно, идејата за исхрана со високо ниво на натриум што предизвикува висок крвен притисок беше тука да остане, и останува и денес. Центрите за контрола на болестите, Националниот институт за здравје, Американската асоцијација за срце и многу други организации во моментов промовираат диета со ниско ниво на натриум.<br/>И покрај навидум обединетиот фронт претставен од овие истакнати организации, контроверзијата меѓу научниците е исклучително загреана. Во 1998 година, наградуваниот автор Таубес, објави "Политичката наука за солта" во Journal of Science. „Контроверзијата околу придобивките, ако воопшто постојат, од намалувањето на солта сега претставува еден од најдолготрајните највитриолошки и надреални спорови во целата медицина.“<br/>Еден генерален хирург во извештајот напишал дека брзината со која американските федерални агенции го прифатиле намалувањето на натриумот „стоела во остра спротивност со тоа колку долго било потребно за препораките за важноста на намалувањето на нивото на холестерол во крвта“. Тој, исто така, забележал дека разликата е уште поизразена со оглед на отсуството на објавени истражувања кои всушност ја тестирале теоријата. Од друга страна, сер Мајкл Ролингс, претседател на Националниот институт за здравје и клиничка извонредност, кој промовира диети за намалување на солта, тврдел дека: „Раководството (во креирањето политики) се заснова на најдобрите достапни докази. Доказите, сепак, можеби не се многу добри и ретко се комплетни.“ Не е многу силен аргумент за намалување на внесот на сол.<br/>Да погледнеме неколку релативно неодамнешни студии. Во 2008 година, италијанските истражувачи почнаа да ги објавуваат резултатите од серија клинички испитувања, од кои сите објавија дека кај пациентите со срцева слабост, намалувањето на потрошувачката на сол го зголемува ризикот од смрт. Овие студии биле проследени со други кои покажале дека кај дијабетичарите од тип 1 и 2, здравите Европејци и пациентите со хронична срцева слабост, оние кои јаделе сол на долната граница на нормалниот опсег, имале поголема веројатност да имаат срцеви заболувања од оние кои јаделе сол во средниот опсег на нормала.<br/>Во 2011 година, два Кокрејнови прегледи не најдоа докази дека диетата со ниска содржина на сол или подобрување или влошување на здравјето на луѓето. По повеќе од 150 случајни клинички испитувања и 13 популациски студии без очигледен сигнал во корист на намалување на натриумот, друга позиција може да биде да се прифати дека таков сигнал можеби не постои.<br/>Дури и со оглед на тоа што нема јасни научни докази кои го поддржуваат тоа, а некои и спротивно, во 2010 година Центарот за контрола и превенција на болести, Институтот за медицина и Американското здружение за хипертензија продолжија да промовираат исхрана со ниско ниво на натриум како средство за контрола на високиот крвен притисок.<br/>На крајот, како медицински професионалец и некој кој има потреба од јасни докази за да донесе одлука за тоа дали можам да додадам обилни количини сол на моите помфрити, задоволен сум што до сега има многу малку! Сите поголеми здравствени организации се чини дека промовираат диета со ниско ниво на натриум, но ниту една не објавила конзистентни студии кои покажуваат дека диетата со ниско ниво на натриум помага во здравјето, особено не и во кардиоваскуларното здравје. Она што најмногу ме вознемирува е тоа што ниту една од овие организации не им кажува на луѓето дека науката зад нивните политики е контроверзна и дека можеби грешат. Роналд Баер, Дејвид Мерит Џонс и Сандро Галеа најдобро го кажале тоа во нивната статија „Сол и јавно здравје“: „По внимателното разгледување на дебатата за солта, заклучивме дека прикривањето на научната неизвесност е грешка која не служи ниту на целите на науката ниту на добрата политика.“<br/>Значи треба да излезеш и да загушиш се во сол сега? Како и со повеќето работи, ако науката не е во можност да одговори на прашањето дефинитивно на еден или на друг начин, и сакате да бидете безбедни наместо да жалите, само одете со старото правило за "умереност во сè". Ако, како мене, сакате да солите сè како раб на чаша маргарита и да бидете проколнати со умереност, барем сега можете да се чувствувате малку подобро за тоа, бидејќи науката се чини дека се повеќе и повеќе се потпира на исхраната со ниско ниво на натриум која е непотребна, а оние со високо ниво на натриум воопшто не се штетни.<br/>Ако ви се допадна оваа статија и бонус факти подолу, исто така може да ви се допадне:<br/>Зошто солта го подобрува вкусот<br/>Што значат броевите во тестот за крвен притисок и што му кажуваат на докторот<br/>Што ги предизвикува рацете, нозете и нозете да заспијат<br/>Топ 5 трикови за прва помош кои секој треба да ги знае<br/>Како да се отстрани свежата дамка од тепихот со ништо друго освен сол<br/>- Високиот крвен притисок не е ниту болест ниту болест сама по себе. Тоа е само фактор на ризик за други проблеми. На пример, ако имате хроничен висок крвен притисок, ризикот од срцев удар или мозочен удар значително се зголемува. Овој висок притисок може да биде предизвикан од прекумерна плака на внатрешноста на ѕидовите на артериите, што ги прави тие артерии помали. Размислете за водовод. Кога цевките што ја транспортираат течноста стануваат помали, притисокот што го зголемува истиот волумен на течноста. Што ќе се случи ако вашиот крвен притисок стане премногу висок? Ќе одговорам на тоа прашање со друг. Што ќе се случи ако притисокот на водата во цевките во вашите домови стане премногу висок? Вашите цевки пукнаа. Истото тука. Доколку вашиот крвен притисок стане премногу висок, вашите артерии имаат поголема шанса да пукнат. Ако има премногу цевки во вашите цевки (плоча во вашите артерии), таа топка од цевки може да стане премногу голема и да ги заглави вашите цевки! Изгледа лошо и јас! Особено, ако тие артерии се во вашиот мозок, или срце. Тоа не е како бубрезите, каде што имате две! Ќе пролеете протекување во тие органи, и вашето семејство конечно добива таа голема плата од вашата полиса за животно осигурување! Не е баш најдобар начин да се плати, добро, освен ако навистина си кретен и сите во твоето семејство те мразат! Тогаш можеби не им пречи толку многу, но сигурно ќе.<br/>- Крвниот притисок се мери во милиметри жива. За референца, 1 psi (фунти по квадратен инч) е еднаков на 51.7149326 милиметри жива. Ако крваревте и сакате да го запрете губењето на крвта со директен притисок, а треба, ќе треба да користите само околу 3 psi за да го спречите. Освен ако немаат навистина висок крвен притисок, тогаш можеби 4 psi. Основна математика повторно го спасува денот!<br/>- Првиот познат експеримент за мерење на точниот крвен притисок бил извршен од Стивен Хејлс на 1 декември 1733 година. Тој земал жив коњ. Прикачил цевка на нејзината лева круларна артерија, а потоа дозволил нејзината крв да брза низ цевката и таа се искачила на висина од 8'3". Тој забележал дека "кога била на полна висина, таа ќе се подигала и паѓала на и по секој пулс 2, 3 или 4 инчи". Да, коњот искрвари, но не мислете дека г-дин Хејлс беше премногу суров, тој го изврши експериментот на коњ кој во секој случај требаше да биде спуштен! За коњот, сигурен сум дека оваа разлика не значеше многу, се разбира.<br/>*Правно одрекување од одговорност: Додека сум медицински професионалец, оваа статија содржи општи информации за медицински состојби и третмани.

Секогаш кога јадам чипс (чипс ако живеете во САД) кој има прилично голема количина на сол, мојот БП значително се зголемува во следните неколку дена.<br/>Се обидов да добијам чипс без сол пред една недела и додадов свој "ло-сол" (замена за сол која се состои од калиум хлорид и натриум хлорид (сол), но двапати повеќе од првиот од вториот).<br/>Како и да е, чипсот со вкус на ло-сол воопшто не ми го подига крвниот притисок.<br/>ОК Знам дека се потребни понатамошни експерименти на себе. Но, во моментов силно се сомневам во солта како виновник. Исто така се сомневам дека шеќерот го зголемува и мојот БП. Но, потребни се многу истражувања за да се утврди тоа!<br/>Можеби имате лош баланс на калиум до натриум. Мајка ми има хипертензија и беше на диета со ниско ниво на натриум, но таа не добиваше доволно калиум и нејзиниот крвен притисок не беше стабилен. Ако сте загрижени, можеби ќе сакате да го проверите нивото на калиум во крвта.<br/>Сега кога консумира доволно калиум, нејзиниот крвен притисок е нормален повеќе од една година, додека консумира натриум во нормални граници (повеќе од 2500 mg).<br/>Не е натриумот... Тоа е маснотии и скроб што ве прави подебели и подебели; и тоа, е зголемување на телесната маса и што го прави потешко за вашето срце да пумпа крв низ вените и артериите кои се скршени во вашето тело од страна на зголемената количина на акумулирани масти.<br/>јадете чист крвав скроб и укажува на сол наместо шеќер, сè за да се избегне инкриминација на шеќер не премногу да се спомене растително масло кое ги зголемува сите причини за смрт. Можете да добиете многу повеќе осмолалност од шеќерот<br/>Потребни цврсти докази? Не е мит и многу лесно да се документира — бара малку интелигенција или обука, секој може да го направи тоа. На возраст од 52-54, ова беше повеќе од две години (2005 и 2006). Користете софтверска програма (Diet Power 4 — платив 50 долари за тоа, но сега е бесплатно за преземање) за следење на храната, натриумот и времето за вежбање на велосипед. Произведени графикони со користење на пенкало и хартија метод иако ќе го стори истото дека програмата немаше одредби за внесување на податоци за крвниот притисок. Лекарот кој чита на секои три до шест месеци е апсолутно безвреден ако не се вложи напор да се чита под исти околности, освен да се покаже општ тренд во текот на неколку години.<br/>Открив дека за да биде од било каква вредност, за мојот тип на графикон и хипотеза (сега докажано), беше неопходно да се земат неколку читања во период од најмалку пет минути или до две блиски (три или помалку нумерички ширење и не повеќе од три bpm на отчукување на срцето) читања. Јас би ги забележал читањата по две милји одење или еден час возење велосипед со бавна до умерена стапка. Широки замавни во текот на пет минути се откажав откако дојдов во физичка форма и останав на исхраната. Професионалните сајтови препорачуваат седење 3 минути или повеќе и да се земе повеќе од едно читање, но имав само еден или двајца лекари во последните дваесет години го прават тоа, некои над потребата брзо да се види друг пациент. Медицинска сестра тврди дека главната причина за мерење на крвниот притисок е тоа што осигурителните компании инсистирале на тоа. Таа тврдела дека некои лекари не ги проверувале читањата што ги направила, па кој се грижи дали е вложен напор да се добие точно читање било нејзиниот заклучок.<br/>Влези откако брзаше да се појави на време, да се искачи по скали или што и да е, седни, една медицинска сестра те фати за рака и ти го зема крвниот притисок. Тој тврди дека ретко чекал, човек со 15 години искуство, иако професионалните сајтови препорачуваат чекање три минути. Друг лекар тврдел дека никогаш не слушнал за На кој влијае на крвниот притисок (тој бил воен лекар со различни стандарди за образование).<br/>Сега на резултатите. Графиконите беа убави и покажаа совршена коалиција помеѓу петте внесени фактори; типот на храна, количината на натриум, вежбањето, срцевиот ритам, тежината.<br/>Бев на крвен притисок медицина за десет години со само нумеричка промена на 5. Јас, исто така, беше во седентарен вработување и доби нула вежбање. Мојата тежина беше на горниот крај на нормална тежина или малку прекумерна тежина. Јас би јадел типични количини на натриум за Американците (2,000+ mg) во текот на два дена. Потоа различни количини на ниско натриум за 4 дена, а потоа постепено се зголемува во текот на период од неколку дена. По 72+ часа на диета со ниско ниво на натриум и програма за вежбање, мојот крвен притисок значително ќе падне. 135/90 до 110/70 во текот на три дена беше типично откако бев на мојот план за исхрана (диета DASH) за еден месец. Нивоа на шеќер и висока хемиска храна, исто така, беа евидентирани како дел од исхраната. Употребата на натриум се појави повеќе од другите вежби како најголема променлива. Висока хемиска храна, исто така, покажа разлика иако висока хемиска храна често имаат високо ниво на натриум.<br/>Во текот на четири дена по продолжување на исхраната DASH ќе има значителна и постепена промена на нагоре. Потребни се два или повеќе дена, во зависност од физичката активност и потрошувачката на вода за да се расипе натриумот во крвта е мојата хипотеза, иако никогаш не сум го потврдил ова од истражувањата.<br/>Сомневам дека нивото на натриум за соодветен крвен притисок варира помеѓу луѓето и различните дизајни на телото (пол, раса, активност, маснотии наспроти слаби, ниво на вежбање, итн.). Многу луѓе можат да имаат мал ефект од 2,000 mg наспроти 600 mg на Na. Јас не сум еден од оние. Се проценува дека пештерските луѓе имале исхрана од 400 до 600mg Na. Она што беше доволно добро за пештерските луѓе (кои имаа краток животен век од други причини) беше доволно добро за мене.<br/>Морав да направам напор да останам на 600 mg поради мојата исхрана. Диетата на која бев беше 200 до 400 mg ако не се присилив да го користам тој шејкер за сол). Натриумот е неопходен дел од вашата исхрана. Најдов Na количини над 1000 mg беа премногу за моето тело. Имам хипертензија и срцеви палпитации со краток здив. Мојот тироидната лабораторија читања стана совршен и лекарот ме зема од тироидната жлезда лекови и крвен притисок лекови. Моето срце палијација и краток здив во 3 до 5 часот наутро секоја ноќ се откажуваат по еден месец. Сите мои проблеми продолжија значително кога се симнав од мојот план за исхрана / вежбање во последниве години. Интересно е тоа што еден постар лекар, кој бил во професијата четириесет години, тврдел дека сум само еден од двајцата луѓе кои отишле од нивото на ТСХ од 0,0 до 4,0 (горниот опсег на нормала) по откажувањето од лековите. Проблемите со тироидната жлезда продолжија заедно со крвниот притисок, палијацијата на срцето и срцето. Сега продолжив со исхраната и планот за вежбање и следење. Ќе испратам ажурирање по три месеци.<br/>Јас сум само една личност, па стави 400 луѓе на истата програма сум бил на и да видиме што се случува. Проблемот, се разбира, е да се најде 200 чесни луѓе од оние 400 кои не се на диета и вежбање база на податоци или претпоставка. Исто така, потребна е моќ на волја за да се држи до програмата. Заглавив со него десет години, а потоа се откажав од разни причини. Отстранете ги оние од базата на податоци кои не покажуваат подобрување кои одбиваат да се заколнат под заклетва и да преземат тест за детектор на лаги!<br/>Солта (натриум) го зголемува крвниот притисок. Отидов на лекар и мојот крвен притисок беше 130/90. Таа ми рече да ја контролирам мојата сол (натриум лимит 1500mg) и имав проверка два дена подоцна со мојот крвен притисок 108/87. Секогаш кога јадам многу солена храна, добивам скок во мојот притисок. Јас сум дефинитивно чувствителен на сол.<br/>СОЛ (натриум) влијае на вашиот крвен притисок. Мора да бидете внимателни (тоа се прикрадува на вас добро) и да ја прилагодите вашата исхрана за да го ограничите внесот на натриум и да внимавате на знаците на зголемување на притисокот. Особено кога вашето однесување на телото се менува.<br/>Вежбајте исто така! Ако сте мрзливи или не толку активни, земете 30 минути прошетки 5 дена во неделата (вкупно 150 минути) минимум за да добиете пристојна вежба.<br/>Мислам дека поентата е дека препораката за диета со пониско ниво на натриум, која можеби влијае на одредена група луѓе, оние кои веќе имаат хипертензија и се чувствителни на сол, на целата популација е смешна. Друга поента е дали високиот внес на сол доведува до хронични кардиоваскуларни проблеми, кои се рекламираат како факт за јавноста, но немаат истражувања за да го поддржат тоа. Конзумирам многу повеќе натриум отколку што препорачува CDC и мојот БП никогаш не бил повисок од 117/70, мојот највисок досега, нормален за 100-110/65-70. Ниту еден од нашите случаи не докажува еден или друг начин на ефектите на "висок" внес на натриум на општата популација.<br/>Може да имате низок клеточен калиум, висок бакар, низок витамин К2, низок магнезиум, низок витамин Е, токсичност на тешки метали како што е олово, сите се изложени на олово и флуорид, овие работи се соединуваат едни со други.<br/>Погледнете ги условите кои предизвикуваат оваа чувствителност на сол, како што е ниско ниво на калиум висок кортизол.<br/>Не се одморајте само на солта, бидејќи најверојатно ќе имате повеќе проблеми, бидејќи речиси никој не јаде сол самостојно.<br/>Солта обично се наоѓа во висок едноставен шеќер без влакна храна со адитиви.<br/>Разбирање на насоките се за целата популација, а не само за вас, ова е проблематично бидејќи нерафинираната сол не се покажа како нездрава за повеќето луѓе и за некои го подобрува здравјето и ги прави овие насоки без препознавање на биохемиската индивидуалност.<br/>Да се разбере дека намалувањето на БПХ не е крај на сè, ова е направено механички со лекови во студии кои не покажуваат подобрување на резултатите, па дури и влошување на симптомите надвор од знакот на мерење на БПХ.<br/>Работи кои треба да се земат предвид, Екстракт од маслинови листови, витамин Е, витамин Ц, витамин К2, калиум, куркумин, стевија (природен засладувач), магнезиум, гранит, л-аргинин, натокиназа, рибино масло, какао, цвекло, алфа липоева киселина, бромелаин, ленено семе, целер, coq10, ленено семе Сите овие ги подобруваат БП и кардиоваскуларните проблеми. Имате многу повеќе во вашиот алатник отколку што мислите<br/>Што се однесува до шеќерот, жените треба да го ограничат шеќерот (Вкупно јаглехидрати е она што е важно и внимавајте на одредени шеќерни алкохоли) 20g-30g закуска и 30g-45g секој оброк. Мажите треба да ја задржат својата закуска иста како и жените 20g-30g закуска и 60g - 75g оброк. Најниските броеви се секако најниски за дијабетичарите.<br/>Верувам дека некои луѓе имаат чувствителност на натриум. Убеден сум дека имам. Откако бев на 3 различни БП лекови во исто време и сè уште имав неконтролирана хипертензија, почнав да читам етикети за храна и драстично го намалувам внесот на натриум. Повеќето преработена храна се натоварени со натриум. Јас бев во можност да се запре 2 лекови целосно и да се намали третиот до 1/4 од пропишаната доза. За мене, намалување на натриум направи огромна разлика. Синоќа земав 10 mg лизиноприл, што е 1/4 од пропишаната дневна доза. Денес мојот БП е премногу низок, 105/48. Навистина морам постојано да го следам, бидејќи нискиот БП не е многу забавен.<br/>Лековите за крвен притисок се неефикасни, тие не успеваат да ги подобрат резултатите само на читањето на БП.<br/>Имате намален внес на ниско калиум високо сол високо шеќер ниско влакна нездрава храна, ова секогаш ќе се намалува вашиот крвен притисок.<br/>Солта не е непријател, ви се потребни само калиум и антиоксиданти за да го балансирате и да го намалите стресот.<br/>Кога луѓето го намалуваат натриумот на овој начин, не можете да придонесете за солта, целосно сте го промениле внесот на многу работи во исхраната, ова е начинот на кој луѓето можат да бидат измамени да мислат дека тоа е само една работа.<br/>Ова припишување на единствена причина за проблемите постојано се прави во хипотеза и тие имаат тенденција да бидат целосно лажни демонизирање на единствени работи како што се Co2, сол, заситени масти, холестерол, недостаток на серотонин, па дури и недостаток на употреба на отровни флуориди.<br/>Овие се сите митови кои не успеваат под контрола, но продолжуваат да се поддржуваат како причини со регулирање на телата со цреша брање и отфрлање на минимизирање на преовладувачки контрадикции. Фармацевтските корпорации за нездрава храна и растително масло имаат корист и ја дезинформацираат јавноста за профит за кој ФДА рекетираат за нивното отстранување на нивната конкуренција.<br/>Медицинските истражувања и голем дел од другите истражувања се инцестуозна измама помеѓу приватниот интерес и зајакнувањето на економијата, како и лекарите на политичарите и владиниот профит.<br/>Уредниците на студиите на списанија се објавени во најдете повеќето студии да бидат целосно недостасува, заклучоци да се врти кон пристрасност кон потврда и дека ние сме во прилично мрачна ера за науката каде што верувањето, консензус и рецензија се помалку за добра наука и повеќе за црна топка натпреварувачки верување и докази кои ќе му наштетат на профит и идни грантови.<br/>Да, сеедно. Верувајте во што сакате. Читам здравствени книги со години....ДЕСЕТИНИ...и сум прочитал во нив ТОЧНО она што е отпечатено во оваа статија. НИКОГАШ нема докажана врска помеѓу солта и високиот крвен притисок. Покрај тоа, во една од книгите се истакнува дека солта се користи за да се направи желудечна киселина, и иронично е дека како што старееме, исхраната со ниско ниво на натриум толку често се рекламира води до дигестивни проблеми.<br/>Продолжете да верувате во лекарите кои земаат 3 кредити за исхрана на колеџ и соединенија кои предизвикуваат полоши несакани ефекти од вистинската болест.<br/>Доктори, кои велат дека киропрактиката не е вистински лек. Еден лекар кој се обидел да докаже дека Чиро е лажен со вршење на аутопсии открил дека 99 од 100 органски откажувања се должат на недостаток на нервна енергија предизвикана од "сублуксации" кои ги штипкаат нервите и го прекинуваат протокот на нервна енергија. (Јас не сум киропрактичар).<br/>Одете да прочитате книги од Норман Вокер, (особено "Свежо овошје и зеленчук."), ТЦ Фрај, и Херберт М. Шелтон (Супериорна исхрана, Постењето може да ви го спаси животот). Ги прочитав сите.<br/>BOTTOM LINE ова е одлична статија и јас сум всушност изненаден да ја видам вистината толку отворено објавени во статија како оваа ... но вие верувате она што го сакате и земете хемикалии притиснати од медицинската професија ... јадете што сакате, пијте што сакате, не вежбајте и кога работите одат наопаку само земете пилула. ...<br/>Се обидов да ги погледнам овие "Winsdor Papers", па дури и Google не знае за што зборувате. Ако навистина сакате да ги освоите луѓето, всушност треба да објавите линкови до информациите што сакате да ги прочитаме.<br/>Момци, сите ви недостасува една точка: натриумот е отровен за нас. Дури и ако не го подигне БП, неговиот отров се уште ; / воопшто не е добар<br/>@Marco: Ќе умреш веднаш без натриум во твоето тело.<br/>Јас не сум истиот Марко како г-дин "Солта е отров".<br/>Се разбира – сè што е во вишок е лошо – по ѓаволите, дури и пиењето премногу вода ќе ве убие.<br/>Сега, секоја личност е различна, па мора да најдете што работи за вас. Мојот, ми се допаѓа солена<br/>Оваа статија е заблуда. Само затоа што негативниот ефект на солта на крвниот притисок е "теорија" не значи дека треба да го игнорираме. Всушност, повеќето од медицината и науката се спроведува на веродостојни теории. Вистината е дека исхраната со ниска сол е помалку штетна од исхраната со висока сол и како и сите нешта, вистинскиот морал на приказната е умереност. Исто така, овој автор си противречи со тоа што вели дека "нема докази ... Да никој" за да ја поддржи оваа теорија, но потоа продолжува да се наведе барем една студија која покажува негативна corolatuon кај луѓето и уште една која вклучува стаорци. Тоа е доказ, барем некои не ниту еден. Поголемиот дел од медицината е црна магија и многу лекари ќе го признаат тоа. Се разбира, понекогаш сме далеку од знаење, но во овој случај има доволно наука зад соли влијание на БП за да го направат вреди да се размисли. Исто така, запомнете дека човечката потрошувачка на големи количини на сол е прилично нова работа на еволутивна скала, па влијанието врз нашите тела е прилично неприродно.<br/>@Мајк: „Нема докази... Да нема“ Мислам дека Скот значи „Нема угледни докази“ или, поточно, „Нема докази кои не се погрешни“.<br/>Како што Скот сака да каже, дури и водата ќе ве убие во доволни дози. Дури еднаш ми раскажал приказна за една жена која се обидел да ја лекува – таа пиела огромни количини вода и на крајот умрела од неа.<br/>"Повеќето од медицината е црна магија и многу лекари ќе го признаат тоа." Мислам дека ниту еден лекар никогаш нема да го каже тоа. Можеби пред еден век или два. Но, има неверојатна количина на добра наука вклучени тука овие денови. Ние сме далеку од тоа да знаеме сè, но тоа сигурно не е црна магија или само претпоставка работа, како што се чини дека подразбира.<br/>Жал ми е што не се согласувам со вас, Дејв. Но, дури и на изворите на видеото, порастот на крвниот притисок на високо-солни диети е евидентно. Додека на крајот на еден од нив, додека зборуваме за безалкохолни пијалоци и закуски компании:<br/>Некои од овие компании се истакнати во обидот да создадат вештачка контроверза во која се сомневаат во врската помеѓу внесот на сол и крвниот притисок, веројатно со надеж дека ќе го запрат или забават секое намалување на внесот на сол во населението за да ја заштитат продажбата на безалкохолни пијалоци.<br/>Дури и, јас не сум специјалист во оваа област, недостатокот на преглед на литературата во извор за ова прашање е вознемирувачки.<br/>Ох диети кои се преработена храна со ниска маснотии висока шеќер висока адитив, набљудувачки студии се бесмислени, овие луѓе јадат обилни количини на шеќер секоја година. Ако мислите дека корпорациите се обидуваат да им се дозволи да користат повеќе сол, тоа е смешно одвлекување на вниманието во правење нешто за да не се погледне во епидемијата на синдромот на метаболизмот на шеќерот.<br/>Колку идиотски што мислите дека набљудувачките студии се важни за нешто друго освен да се предложи хипотеза, тогаш користите интервенција и двојно слепи плацебо студии без променливи за да ги докажете како каузални. Ова не е направено, исто така не е направено за холестерол или заситени масти. Вие сте наивна жртва на патолошката наука, кога тој вели дека нема докази, нема докази дека набљудувачките студии немаат контрола за ништо друго освен за експеримент, ова не е начинот на кој науката функционира. Вие разбирате дека кокраните се можеби најнеутралната група за клинички студии во светот и тие ги разгледаа 150 испитувања и 13 популациски студии. Овде велите дека нивните наоди се погрешни врз основа на што? Ништо друго освен вашето верување базирано на хипотеза без докази.<br/>Ви предлагам да ја прочитате книгата "Сол". Тоа е главно геополитичка историска приказна за солта во нашата цивилизација, но исто така има и многу наука во неа. Ние ја изградивме нашата цивилизација на сол.<br/>Првиот став вели: „само сфатете дека тоа е само теорија и не е поткрепено со голем дел од какви било цврсти научни докази“, верувам дека бидејќи ова е научна веб-страница, таа не треба да ја користи теоријата на зборот во овој контекст, бидејќи во науката, теоријата е прифатено објаснување на феномен, докажано со тестирање.<br/>Ќе морам да ја погледнам историјата на теоријата и да видам дали некој знае како завршила со две толку различни значења.<br/>За медицински професионалец (што доведува до претпоставка за напредно образование), имате ужасно разбирање на граматиката и правописот. Ова го дискредитира многу од она што го кажувате, во мојот ум. Имајќи некој друг да ја прегледа вашата работа пред објавувањето ќе оди долг пат.<br/>Ќе продолжам да го слушам мојот кардиолог за ова прашање и да го ограничам внесот на сол.<br/>@Mark: Нешто што навидум е вистина за голем број медицински професионалци, стереотипот дека нивниот ракопис е ужасен е генерално точен. (Скот е особено лош.) И нивното техничко пишување, исто така, понекогаш може да биде особено страшно, пред-уредување. (Тие учат медицина и човечкото тело, а не пишување, на крајот на краиштата) Но, во повеќе од 100 статии Скот напишал, тој никогаш не е докажано дека се во право во една главна точка (и само неколку случаи на тоа да се биде во право во мала точка). Типови? Непријатна реченица? Секогаш ќе најдете барем еден од овие во секоја од неговите статии, и покрај моите искрени напори да се ослободам од сите нив. Но, на крајот, се грижам за точноста многу повеќе од граматиката. И двете би било добро, но наоѓањето на писател на посебната експертиза на Скот и способноста да размислуваат критички и да обработуваат огромни количини на медицинско знаење е исклучително тешко. Овие луѓе не се десетина пари.<br/>Но, всушност, силата на аргументите на Скот никогаш не се заснова на неговото широко медицинско знаење. Тоа само му помага темелно да ги провери различните студии на оваа тема каде што повеќето би се изгубиле во терминологијата, а камоли да можат критички да размислуваат за нив и нивната методологија. Силата на аргументот е самите студии. Во оваа, би било добро да ги прочитате двете Кокрејнови рецензии, и можеби да ги пренесете на вашиот кардиолог за неговите мисли.<br/>Не бидете изненадени ако тој / таа веќе ги подготвени, иако, а можеби дури и се согласува со нив. Она што лекарите им кажуваат на своите пациенти не е секогаш во согласност со она што тие всушност знаат или веруваат дека е вистина. Особено во вакви случаи кога тужбите може да бидат многу реална можност ако ви кажат да јадете сета сол што сакате, тогаш умревте од срцев проблем (но немајќи никаква врска со солта), тогаш вашето семејство ги тужи и цитира што велат различни владини агенции на оваа тема, наместо што всушност мисли медицинскиот свет. Набљудувањето на натриумот најверојатно нема да боли, но го покрива грбот на кардиолозите. (Всушност, имав интересна дискусија за ова со Скот синоќа за еден доктор со кој разговараше за ова, кој рече нешто многу слично на тоа зошто и покрај тоа што знае дека натриумот нема да биде штетен на овој начин, тој сè уште им кажува на некои од неговите пациенти да го следат нивниот внес на натриум.)<br/>На крајот, како што секогаш велам, "прашајте сè", но исто така и кога прашувате, направете го истражувањето за да ги најдете одговорите, а потоа двојно проверете го истражувањето само за да бидете сигурни. И, можеби не ја прават грешката изедначувајќи ја граматиката и способноста за пишување со познавање на предмет или интелигенција. Сум работел со тони писатели. Можам да кажам, новинарите (и други такви луѓе со позадина за пишување) се одлични во пишувањето ... Речиси сите се ужасни во истражувањето, што ме изненади на новинарите, но можеби објаснува многу за состојбата на медиумите известување за научни студии. Смешно доволно, најдобра комбинација на пишување способност и истражување се чини дека се адвокати. Тие се феноменални и во двете од моето искуство. Научниците, или луѓето со научна позадина, имаат тенденција да бидат сиромашни во пишувањето, но неверојатни во истражувањето и критичкото размислување. Се разбира, тоа се случува само со примерок од неколку десетици писатели со кои сум работел, и има еден исклучок што го најдов во тоа, но тоа е тренд што го забележав.<br/>Мислам дека секој мора да биде различен. За мене солта многу го зголемува крвниот притисок. Јас го проверувам bl pr 4-6x дневно. Останува доволно ниско кога останувам под 300 mg сол. Веднаш штом ќе јадам многу сол, како кинеска храна или дури и месо и сирење или две парчиња пица, мојот bl pr оди на 170/98. Потребни се неколку дена за да ја извадам солта од моето тело. Потоа ќе се спушти на 130/80, а понекогаш и малку пониско. Јас сум 67.<br/>штотуку понудивте работи кои содржат големи количини на едноставни јаглехидрати, исто така содржат пченица. Шеќерот има висока осмоларност, но се игнорира поради тежината што се применува на сол<br/>Самата елиминација на пченицата со исхрана може да го намали крвниот слој за 20-40 mmHG. Проширувањето на животот на компанијата вели дека ова, исто така, позитивно го оптимизира профилот на липиди во крвта.<br/>Дали гледате како можеби го базирате она што го гледате врз претпоставка врз основа на она што ви е кажано врз основа на хипотезата која нема докази.<br/>Кардиоваскуларните проблеми во набљудувачките студии откриле корелација само кај луѓето кои јадат многу голема количина на 5 грама сол на ден, можете да замислите колкава количина на нездрава храна ја јадат за да ја постигнат оваа количина.<br/>Ако вашиот проблем е сол имате основна состојба што го предизвикува, бидејќи не се добива висока сума на било кој начин, но исто така се игнорира други причини што е проблемот кога единствените работи се рекламираат како главен фактор придонес кога нема докази укажуваат дека тие се причината.<br/>размислете за вашиот клеточен калиум, бакар, изложеност на олово, магнезиум, внес на витамин Е, нивоа на coq10, иританти и стрес кои можат да ја зголемат коагулацијата и стеснувањето на крвните садови.<br/>Ако можам да коментирам за целата правописна / граматичка контроверза ... во моето искуство од набљудување на луѓето, населението (барем интелигентните, целото мое семејство е високо IQ и мојот сопруг е гениј, буквално, и бидејќи немам пријатели со пониска интелигенција за контролна група, можам да зборувам само од моите набљудувања на моето семејство и семејството на сопругот,) е поде во два вида: математички луѓе и збор. Татко ми беше математичар, како и јас кога бев многу мал, сепак, живеев со мајка ми, која дефинитивно е личност со зборови, целиот мој живот, што доведе до моето развивање во личност со зборови. Мојот сопруг можеби е најпаметната личност што некогаш сум ја сретнал, но од неговиот правопис, граматика и речник, никогаш нема да знаете. Тој е компјутерски технолог, може да поправи се, многу разноврсен во своите способности за работа, може да ги реши проблемите со алгебрата со кои се борам неколку минути во исто време со само еден поглед, но не може да го спелува името на нашиот син.<br/>Колку што можам да кажам, научниците имаат тенденција да бидат повеќе математички луѓе отколку зборови луѓе. (Само за да се знае, една од моите претходни работни места беше истражување, и јас сум граматика нацистички и sesquipedalian.<br/>Се прашував дали би можел да го прашам авторот на оваа статија за една мала услуга.<br/>На почетокот ја прочитав оваа реченица во врска со внесот на сол:<br/>Но, ќе ја покријам теоријата за тоа зошто солта го зголемува крвниот притисок подолу - само сфатете [тоа е само теорија] и не е поддржана од голем дел од цврстите научни докази.<br/>Тука ја користите "Теорија" во нејзиниот популарен јазик. Што е во ред и сè. Проблемот е во тоа што ова е научна статија поврзана и кога теоријата не е поддржана со докази, ја нарекуваме "Хипотеза".<br/>Оние од нас кои пишуваат во научната сфера треба да направат напор да ја направат оваа разлика, главно затоа што следниот пат кога ќе добијам некој креационист од Младата Земја кој ќе ми каже дека еволуцијата е „само теорија“, се колнам дека ќе почнам да скокам нагоре и надолу како шимпанзо и ќе направам наназад самераулт. Тогаш ќе му фрлам фекалии.<br/>Сигурна сум дека не сакаш ваква сцена да стане реалност.<br/>Затоа, ајде да започнеме кампања за да ја наречеме Теорија „кохерентна група на тестирани општи предлози, кои најчесто се сметаат за точни, кои можат да се користат како принципи на објаснување и предвидување за класа на феномени“ и да наречеме сè што е наменето да биде извлечено од нечиј заден отвор „Хипотеза“.<br/>БТВ: Знам дека речникот ги враќа двете значења. За доброто на науката, ајде да го смениме значењето бидејќи веќе имаме добар работен збор за "Само го извадив ова од мојот газ".<br/>@Marco: Тоа е добра поента. Ќе почнам да работам на таа разлика во идните статии.<br/>Ниту еден легитимен заклучок не може да се извлече од едно мерење на крвниот притисок. БП варира во голема мера дури и од момент до момент. Сум видел многу пати 160/100 пад до 130/75 во текот на неколку минути. Исто така, опремата за мерење на BP е многу променлива и подложна на широки варијации од работи како што се големината на манжетната и варијациите на корисникот.<br/>Сите заклучоци изведени од неколку мерења не се ништо повеќе од шпекулации и желби.<br/>Прво, ова не е рецензирана статија во списанието. Се согласувам, правилната употреба на "теорија" е замаглена од колоквијалната "само претпоставка". Но, ајде да продолжиме, добро?<br/>Не сфаќам дека статијата е во најмала рака заблуда. Јас не сфаќам дека авторот ја прави поентата дека очигледно е изгубена на многу — "Како што е наведено, во моментов нема цврсти докази дека солта хронично ќе го зголеми крвниот притисок. Да, никој."<br/>Тој, исто така, споменува да размислува критички. Значи, ако не му верувате, а) продолжете со вашето верување, или б) дознајте за себе. Направете ја работата со нозете. Прочитајте ги статиите. Сега имате појдовна точка. Му благодарам за тоа.<br/>Според мое мислење, фокусирањето на повремената граматичка грешка или дебатата "теорија наспроти претчувство" непотребно ја намалува намената на авторот. Мојот излез е дека овој напис ми помага да ги предизвикам моите претпоставки за она што мислев дека веќе е научно заклучено. Научив нешто, во тоа е поентата.<br/>@Michael Stelly Не сум сигурен дали конкретно се однесува на мојот пост во врска со употребата на "теорија", но ве уверувам дека мојот коментар не беше наменет да го критикува писателот на сите. Барем не во истите термини како граматичка или правописна "грешка".<br/>Мојот коментар не е за „грешка“, туку е сугестија дека оние од нас кои читаат и пишуваат за науката го прават нашиот дел за да ја вратат употребата на зборот „теорија“ од мејнстримот или дека барем се обидуваме.<br/>Постојат оние кои коментираат за очигледни правописни грешки и се согласувам дека тие не се важни во контекст на информациите дадени во статијата (иако се согласувам дека тие можат да бидат одвлекување на вниманието и јас зборувам од не-мајчин англиски говорник), но освен ако нивниот број и карактер е таков што го прават разбирањето на статијата тешко или дури и невозможно, нема да ме најдете објавување за нив.<br/>Зборот "теорија", од друга страна, е збор кој активно се користи од страна на одредени фракции на науката / религијата дискусија за да се отфрли 200 години на научен напредок и активно се користи за да се заведат децата во отфрлање на науката во целина.<br/>Ако сте ја гледале дебатата Нај-Хам, Гокер побарал од некои креационисти да напишат прашање до поддржувачите на еволуцијата на парче хартија и тие ги објавиле овие прашања во форма на слики. Секогаш се појавило прашањето "тоа е само теорија".<br/>Во тој дух ги замолив кураторите на оваа веб-страница да се обидат да го користат зборот во неговото научно значење. Ако ние во науката и техничките полиња не го направиме тоа, не можеме да очекуваме оние кои сакаат да ја извртат науката за своите цели да го направат тоа сами.<br/>Значи, со сета почит, јас нема да го прифати вашиот совет. Јас сигурно ќе се лизгаат глупави правописни грешки, но ова е важно за мене и тоа треба да биде важно за сите нас кои ја сакаат науката.<br/>никој не ја искривува науката повеќе од еволуционистите, заклучоци и шпекулации врз основа на претпоставка на факти не се докази. Ниту едно поле нема толку многу измами и претпоставки како еволуцијата.<br/>Продолжувајќи да го користиме погрешниот контрадикторен аргумент и претпоставката дека бидејќи создавањето мора да биде погрешно, еволуцијата мора да биде вистинита не е наука, доказите не покажуваат дека макроеволуцијата е можна во овој момент под било која од многуте актуелни конкурентни теории базирани исклучиво на мутација и природна селекција. Мора да се најде друг механизам.<br/>Како што стои, контрадикторните докази се целосно игнорирани или дури се тврдат како доказ за посложен процес, но сепак доказ за еволуција кога тоа не е така во сите случаи.<br/>Во моментов имаме докази за абиогенезата дека тоа е апсолутно факт, како што е микроеволуцијата апсолутно точна, сепак, во однос на макроеволуцијата, би предложил науката да се врати да биде базирана на докази, а не на претпоставка за факти и извртување на податоците за да ја индуцира премногу да се вклопи во теоријата.<br/>Како што стои еволуцијата не е наука, тоа е верување слично на теоријата на Големата експлозија која има масивни противречни докази дека во минатото, кога луѓето користеле докази за да ја докажат или побијат теоријата оваа теорија би била отфрлена, комбинацијата на двете теории е слична на религијата, религијата на секуларните хуманисти. Тоа е како политички како што доаѓаат заедниците кои ги поддржуваат овие верувања црна топка и ad hominem тие не можат да стојат на докази, но на заплашување. Студиите покажуваат дека ad hominem е корисен како аргументиран аргумент, ова се користи од страна на нелигитамната наука, како што се климатскиот алармизам базиран на CO2 и макроеволуцијата, кои во моментов немаат докази во нивна корист, но ги користат истите видови на пропаганда и напади кои сугерираат дека секој кој им се спротивставува е анти-наука или морон.<br/>Препорачувам да го прочитате http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>Луѓето кои не се согласуваат со еволуцијата автоматски не веруваат во создавањето, еволуционистите секогаш напаѓаат и го одвлекуваат вниманието од сопствените слаби аргументи, создаваат сопствени ѕвезди на она во што другите веруваат и претпоставуваат врз основа на нивните сопствени често моронски претпоставки дека тие се поддржани од докази кога тие не се.<br/>Еден факт би сакал да го додадам:<br/>Тиазиди и тиазидни диуретици се уште еден доказ во оваа контроверза. Интересно е дека тиазидите се нарекуваат диуретици, но кога се земаат дневно, овој диуретичен ефект станува речиси нула. По периодот на хронична терапија со тиазиди, примарната корист од овие лекови е дека тие ја зголемуваат елиминацијата на натриум и хлоридни јони од крвта преку Na / Cl симпортерот во дисталната завиткана тубула (заедно со други ефекти како што е задржување на калциум). И покрај губењето на диуретичкиот ефект, тиазидот го задржува долгорочниот ефект на намалување на крвниот притисок и е еден од лековите кои се користат во првата линија за намалување на крвниот притисок. Овој ефект на намалување генерално се припишува на елиминацијата на натриумот и се чини дека е во согласност со идејата дека високите нивоа на натриум го зголемуваат крвниот притисок.<br/>Верувале или не, солта ми го намалува крвниот притисок. Ако изедам премногу чипс, всушност ми се врти од нискиот крвен притисок. Не можам да кажам дека го добивам.<br/>Оваа "теорија" е едноставно глупава. Солта го зголемува крвниот притисок големо време! Тоа е факт, забележан, следен. Случајно изедете некои прилично солени работи еден ден отколку што е потребна недела на диуретици за да се ослободите од целата таа сол од телото и да го вратите крвниот притисок од 190-200 (!! да, тоа високо го доби!!!) во нормала (120-130). Не кажувајте приказни кои не се вистинити.<br/>Не сите луѓе реагираат подеднакво на солта во исхраната. Мојот предлог за нас е да го земеме предвид нивото на натриум во нашата нормална лабораторија, што резултира со минимална годишна физика.<br/>Од детството, јас сум навикнат да се земе повеќе сол со моите оброци, но никогаш не се соочи со проблемот на висок БП, наместо тоа понекогаш оди под нормално. Googled овој проблем и дојде до заклучок дека моето тело има потреба од сол повеќе од нормално да се компензира за генетски пренесени "низок БП" проблем. Па? Вашиот мозок е инструктор за вашето здравје. Мора да ги следите неговите наредби за да останете навистина здрави!<br/>Па, јас сум само нутриционист (како универзитетска нутриционистка која ќе дипломира во мај) и можеби она што го научив е бик, но откако размислував за патофизиологијата на тоа како натриумот може да влијае на крвниот притисок, сметам дека препораката има смисла, но ќе треба да направите повеќе од само намалување на натриумот. Едно нешто што е важно е соодносот на натриум: калиум (т.е. јадете куп високо преработени, натриум додадени намирници во споредба со свежо или замрзнато овошје и зеленчук). Ќе признаам дека не секој е чувствителен на сол и дека ние свесно одлучивме, во областа на здравјето, да претпоставиме дека секој е затоа што тестирањето за чувствителност на сол (ако тоа е збор!) е скапо, долго и непрактично. Но, идејата дека нема добри веродостојни докази кои ја поврзуваат солта и хипертензијата е лажна. Еве само 6 статии. Овие не се оние кои беа дадени од страна на нашите професори да читаат (иако ако сакате да ги најдете за вас јас сум сигурен дека можам), но тие сепак се добри и не ви треба посебен универзитетски код или членство за да пристапите до нив. Во секој случај, еве го во случај да сакате да прочитате повеќе:<br/>Дали некој од овие покажуваат дека постои корелација без други фактори? Вие велите "ќе треба да направите повеќе од само намалување на натриум"... има ли докази дека правењето на овие други активности без намалување на натриумот не функционира исто како и намалувањето на натриумот?<br/>Зарем не прочитавте? Кокрејн користеше 150 испитувања и 13 студии право? па имате 6, ова е вашето "образование" на работа. Мозочно перење, а потоа потврда пристрасна потрага за поддршка на неисправната хипотеза за која се покажа дека веќе не е со висок квалитет.<br/>Ако Кокрејн не го користеше тоа не е висококвалитетна статија, ако го направи, тогаш поддршката не беше значајна во статијата. Механизмот на осмолалитет се однесува на исхраната со високо ниво на шеќер, но сепак сето тоа е за сол<br/>Проблемот тука е низок квалитет на студии се објавуваат постојано дека луѓето заклучуваат каузалност од каде што тие не можат да го направат тоа, бидејќи тие не ги контролираат сите променливи.<br/>Истото се прави и за хипотезата за липидите и хипотезата за холестеролот.<br/>Ова се исто така митови, холестеролот од сите податоци е обратно поврзан со срцеви заболувања.<br/>Апсолутно намалување на ризикот од срцеви заболувања е 1,4%, што едвај е значајно, ефектите на статините за намалување на срцевите проблеми кај оние кои веќе имаат срцев удар може целосно да се должат на нивното дејство како антикоагулант. Науката за патолошко ѓубре повторно се користи за притискање на третмани без препознавање на механизми и променливи. Повеќето луѓе ќе бидат оштетени со инхибирање на синтезата на витамин К и холестерол преку статини, но лекарите поддржани од фармацевтската алчност промовираат давање на сите.<br/>Заситените масти немаат механизам преку кој може да го зголеми холестеролот, ниту една студија за замена на маслото чисто заменети масти за масло во двојни слепи ги контролира сите променливи и колку поблиску до тоа, толку полоши се резултатите од интервенцијата на ПУФА, зголемувајќи ги сите причини за смрт.<br/>Како што е кажано дека испитувањата се со низок квалитет, нема многу волја да се поништи хипотезата дека регулирањето на телата и лекарите имаат религиозно верување во тоа што не е поддржано со докази. Оваа дезинформација доведува до лошо здравје и фармацевтски профит.<br/>Бев растргнат помеѓу да јадам повеќе сол или не, бидејќи јадењето повеќе сол го намалува срцевиот ритам и БП и ме прави подобро да спијам; моите раце и нозе се чувствуваат полни и топли. Мојот волумен на пот се зголемува додека возам велосипед или одам. Но, потоа по земањето на недела или 2 тогаш забележувам дека БП станува упорно висок; што ме тера да се чувствувам дека сум направил погрешно со јадење. Она што оваа статија го споменува е зголемување на волуменот на течноста што е интересно. Пред да го зголемам внесот на сол, прстите ми се чувствуваат слаби. Можеби по нивото на течностите се чувствувам нормално да ја намалат солта на нормално ниво. Јас само претпоставувам дека луѓето кои имаат чувствителни на сол имаат добар волумен на течност и треба да гледаат внес на сол, други можат да земаат сол, но да престанат кога се чувствува полна. Во основа, користете сол за одржување на волуменот на течноста.<br/>Врз основа на само-експериментирање, мислам дека одржувањето на волуменот на течноста е многу важно. Понекогаш, наоѓам дека се чувствувам жеден и пијам вода и дека постојано излегува; што бара малку внес на сол. Во суштина, јас не јадам конзервирана храна или многу брза храна, мојот внес на сол е она што намерно се додава во готвењето. По вежбање, (јадење од книгата и вежбање итн предизвикуваат проблеми премногу) Јас забележувам дека кога ќе стане од седечка положба, јас се чувствувам вртоглавица, но не нормално. Мислам дека може да се потење надвор сол и, се разбира, пијат многу вода за време на вежбањето. Јас не предлагам да јадете повеќе сол. Она што го велам е начинот на кој телото ви кажува дека вашата сол е исцрпена е кога не се чувствувате полни во вашите нозе и раце. Мислам дека тоа е во извесна мера точно, бидејќи телото повеќе работи на концентрацијата на нештата отколку на апсолутните количини. Тоа не е сеопфатна теорија, бидејќи постојат и други работи кои можат да го зголемат волуменот на крвта, можеби веќе имате премногу сол во крвта итн. За протоколот, мојот натриум во крвта е секогаш близу до долниот крај на опсегот, па мојата грешка нема да ме турка надвор од опсегот.<br/>Добро, што е заклучокот? Дали го користам шејкерот за сол сега или не? Предолго го држам.<br/>Мислам дека оваа статија е неодговорна во тоа што солта апсолутно не го зголемува BP кај оние кои имаат чувствителност на сол. Ако јадам нешто многу солено, буквално можам да одам во хипертензивна криза за еден час.<br/>Овој тип на чувствителност е честа појава и да не ја споменуваме (бидејќи не се вклопува со теоријата на авторите?) е опасна.<br/>@Jim porter: "бидејќи тоа не се вклопува со теоријата на авторите?" "Авторската теорија" не постои. Тоа навистина не е она што го правиме тука. Ова е статија која едноставно пишува за научните студии на оваа тема и го кажува она што тие го кажуваат, за да не мора да ги пребарувате и да го пребарувате целиот медицински жаргон; ние го правиме тоа за вас - во суштина, она за што пишуваме ја одразува моменталната состојба на човечкото знаење за оваа тема. Ако се промени во некој момент, ќе го ажурираме написот. Во овој случај, сепак, најзначајните два Кокрејнови прегледи се прилично убедливи: „По повеќе од 150 случајни клинички испитувања и 13 популациски студии без и очигледен сигнал во корист на намалувањето на натриумот, друга позиција може да биде да се прифати дека таков сигнал можеби не постои.“ Постојат исклучоци од секое правило, и навидум вие сте едно и тоа е многу интересно ако е така и би било интересно да се дознае основната причина. Но, повторно, ние гледаме што велат научните студии и се обидуваме да го одразиме тоа во она што го пишуваме. Во суштина, ние пишуваме форма на "светлосно читање" стил забавни истражувачки трудови на теми, наместо да пишуваат истражувачки трудови.<br/>Нагласувањето за солта најверојатно ќе ве убие долго пред самата сол. Правете го она што ве прави среќни и најверојатно ќе живеете подолго од поинаку; и дури и ако не, барем ќе уживате во времето што го имате.<br/>Верувам дека проблемот е кога солта се меша со масти и ТОА предизвикува висок крвен притисок. На пример, некој зборуваше за нивното зголемување кога јадат чипс / чипс-тоа е затоа што чиповите содржат масти. Истото би важело и за помфрит или други масни јадења. Меѓутоа, ако попрскате сол на нешто како овошје, тоа нема да го има истиот ефект и нема да го зголеми крвниот притисок.<br/>Мислам дека натриумот добива лош рап и некои луѓе всушност консумираат премногу малку. Мислам дека да се има сол со овошје или салати е во ред, но проблемот е комбинацијата сол/маст и ако размислите за тоа, тоа е местото каде луѓето обично ги добиваат своите чипови со сол, помфрит, тешко зачинето месо, во кремасти јадења итн.<br/>Личноста која ја напишала оваа статија не додава ништо вредно на дискусијата за високиот крвен притисок, освен да ги поттикне луѓето да ги стават главите во песокот.<br/>Се борам со висок крвен притисок околу 12 години откако една сериозна несреќа ме натера да бидам физички неактивен околу една година по несреќата.<br/>Високиот крвен притисок може да се контролира со и без лекови и поединци реагираат различно на различни третмани и постојат природни лекови за оваа болест.<br/>Високиот крвен притисок може да предизвика мозочен удар, хеморагии на мозокот и да придонесе за дијабетес и болести на бубрезите.<br/>Равнотежата помеѓу калиумот и натриумот во крвта е многу критична и за жал, повеќето лекари немаат поим за ефектот што исхраната и правилната хидратација имаат врз оваа состојба.<br/>Поголемиот дел од лекарите што сум бил само да даде рецепти кои може или не може да работат.<br/>Постојат природни супстанции кои ми овозможиле да го намалам крвниот притисок во рок од неколку дена од екстремно висок до речиси нормален, додека лекарите и фармацевтите ќе кажат дека лековите (како Cozaar и Norvasc) може да потраат до еден месец за да работат.<br/>Открив дека сок од еден лимон со кора или етерично масло додаден во 16 унци минерална вода има значајни ефекти.<br/>Пиењето на ова еднаш или двапати дневно имаше многу значаен ефект во мојот случај; мојот крвен притисок се зголеми од 220/95 на 130/90 во рок од 3 дена.<br/>Лукот (дезодориран) исто така помага, а овошните или зеленчуковите сокови со намалена содржина на сол и висока содржина на калиум исто така помагаат. (V-8 ниска сол или V-8 зелена).<br/>Ова не е размислување за желби; тоа има врска со хемијата; тоа не значи дека сите ќе реагираат исто на овие третмани, но јас не се согласувам многу силно кога некој вели дека солта нема ефект врз крвниот притисок.<br/>Мислам дека ова е неодговорно и кавалерско, освен ако не работите за еден од производителите на сол.<br/>Солта е неопходна и повеќето кујнски соли содржат јод, кој е суштинска хранлива материја за луѓето.<br/>Пиењето доволна количина чиста вода е исто така многу важно, нешто што моите лекари никогаш не се труделе да го спомнат.<br/>Ова му овозможува на телото да се ослободи од вишокот сол и му помага на телото да се прочисти.<br/>Постојат многу природни супстанции и некои намирници (како песто) кои можат да помогнат во намалување на крвниот притисок и можете да најдете многу постови на интернет за нив.<br/>Web Md и Клиниката Mayo имаат постови на оваа тема и им верувам многу повеќе од авторот на овој пост.<br/>Мислам дека ова е вежба за одбрана на неодбранливото.<br/>За која цел?<br/>Кој бил Хипократ и што знаел?<br/>Имам екстремно низок крвен притисок. Ако станам пребрзо, ќе се онесвестим на лицето. Докторот ми рече да јадам колку што сакам сол, без грижи.<br/>Во секој случај, ќе ги прифатам сите овие совети со малку... знаеш што. ;-D<br/>Јадам многу сол (и мислам на *ЛОТ *). Пред неколку години, откако ми беше доста постојано да ми кажуваат колку е лошо, решив да го тестирам. Како д-р знам како научно да планирам тест, и во текот на неколку месеци минимизирајќи колку што е можно повеќе променливи, го тестирав мојот крвен притисок додека на мојот редовен внес на сол наспроти низок внес на сол. Резултатите беа речиси како што се очекуваше, иако некои луѓе /можеби/ се малку нетолерантни на релативно високи нивоа на внес на сол, за мене воопшто немаше разлика. Се вратив на јадење храна на начинот на кој го сакам (слано), и да им кажам на сите кои советува против ова тие едноставно не знаат што зборуваат за LOL<br/>Јас сум 27 жена. Почнав да имам висок крвен притисок додека земав Accutane пред една и пол година (Accutane го зголемува акумулацијата на холестерол). Она што го доживеав беше интензивна, мојот пулс беше на 120bpm, бев вртоглавица, моите раце се стегнати во необична канџа форма и тие пецкаат додека не се изгуби чувство. Мислев дека всушност умирам. Ми беше кажано дека тоа е само напад на паника, но никогаш не сум имал никакви вистински проблеми со анксиозноста. Ми беше даден кислород за целиот час кога одеднаш почнав да копнеам по сол. Го замолив мојот пријател да трча до McDonalds и да ми донесе некои екстра солени помфрити. За неколку минути откако ја изедов целата сол, мојот крвен притисок се врати во нормала, рацете ми се вратија и можев повторно да одам и да дишам нормално.<br/>Сметам дека работите кои го предизвикуваат тоа најмногу за мене се недостаток на спиење, не јадат ништо по цел ден, пченка, пченица и хемиски соли како што е MSG. Но, морската сол и нормалната кујнска сол не го влошуваат, тие го прават тоа подобро! Со тоа рече, Отсекогаш сум имал резултати од крвните тестови кои покажуваат високо ниво на калиум. Може ли ова некако да биде вклучено? Мојот д-р Само го спушта рамената како предизвикано од мојата љубов кон компири и цитрусни плодови lol<br/>Можеби ќе ви треба нов лекар со високо ниво на калиум или хиперкалемија може да предизвика епизоди што ги опишувате и Accutane може да предизвика хиперкалемија.<br/>Калиумот и натриумот се очигледно поврзани, бидејќи вашите клетки постојано ги разменуваат во и надвор од клетките за да одржуваат повисоки интрацелуларни концентрации на калиум.<br/>Кортизолот кој се зголемува со лишување од сон, не јадење и други стресови го свртува овој процес на концентрација на калиум во клетката, но има за цел да ја зголеми екскрецијата на калиум, клеточната апсорпција на натриум и задржување на натриум во бубрезите, може да има нешто што не е во ред со овој процес со не се излачува калиум. Нормалната причина е инхибиција на системот ренин-ангиотензин кој го регулира крвниот притисок.<br/>Солта ги негува надбубрежните жлезди, но можеби ќе сакате да добиете повеќе витамин Ц, кој е концентриран таму, како и во хипофизата, бидејќи тие го регулираат вашиот кортизол и витаминот Ц го намалува кортизолот и стресот, најверојатно, ја намалува сериозноста на епизодите.<br/>Работи кои треба да се разгледаат, магнезиум, витамин е, надбубрежни жлезди, нивоа на бакар / цинк, функција на бубрезите и надбубрежните жлезди.<br/>Фармацевт тука. Ви благодариме за сите корисни коментари на оваа страница. Може да се видат сите интелигентно напишани мислења од луѓе кои го намалиле својот висок крвен притисок со ограничување на солта. Јас сум еден од овие луѓе. Мојот крвен притисок пред една година беше во просек 180/120 кога не се земаа лекови, а кога се земаа три различни лекови, во просек 140/90. Откако се чувствував ужасно, или од несакани ефекти од лековите или од главоболки од висок крвен притисок, одлучив да ја променам исхраната. Резултатите што ги постигнав беа прекрасни. Крвниот притисок е совршено нормален, 120/80. Нема главоболки, или чувство како моето грло беше отечен, или чувство како мојата глава беше премногу топло.... Можам да одам на и на. Јас го направив ова со НЕ скапи производи. Јас само, колку што е можно во денешно време во САД, јадеше непреработена храна, и избегнуваше сите додадени сол. Забележете, сите "додадени" сол. Како што многумина правилно истакнаа, солта е неопходна за човечкиот живот. И многу намирници природно ја содржат целата сол што ни е потребна, така што не е неопходно да се додава. Слушајќи ги овие претпоставени експерти, се прашувам како било кој човек некогаш преживеал пред 10.000 години, ако не биле доволно среќни да најдат солен блок за лижење секој ден! Прочитав еден коментар за некој кој има добри резултати од "сок од еден лимон со кора или етерично масло додадено на 16 унци минерална вода". Јас би предизвикал него и другите да само пробајте сок од лимон со вода. Откривам дека ако се исчистам со само една чаша вода од лимон еднаш неделно, тоа имаше прекрасен ефект врз моето здравје. Другите состојки може да помогнат, но тоа ќе биде интересен експеримент за вас. Па јас, како, многу, многу други, јас сум чувствителен на сол. Можеби некои луѓе можат да јадат огромна количина на сол на редовна основа без негативни ефекти врз здравјето. Тоа не е вистина за многу од нас, и тоа е навредливо кога таканаречените "професионалци" или "научници" го оспоруваат ова. Една работа секогаш им кажувам на моите пациенти, "Кога станува збор за вашето здравје, верувајте си пред сите други". Ако сте убедени дека одреден лек ве тера да се чувствувате лошо, а вашиот лекар или фармацевт имплицира дека сè е во вашата глава, верувајте си себеси, а не нив. Ако, како мене, се чувствувате илјада пати подобро кога ја ограничувате потрошувачката на сол или преработена храна, тогаш ве молам, продолжи да го правиш тоа што го правиш, и не ги слушај оние кои сугерираат спротивно! Ќе бидете поздрави и посреќни. Ви благодарам што слушавте, пријатели мои од далеку.<br/>Иако секако е можно дека сте чувствителни на сол, кога одлучивте да ја промените вашата исхрана, променивте многу други работи покрај тоа колку сол сте јаделе. Два од најлесните начини за намалување на крвниот притисок без промена на солта се 1. губење на тежината. 2. јадете повеќе зеленчук и овошје (ака храна богата со калиум). Бројни клинички и набљудувачки студии покажаа дека соодносот на натриум и калиум е веројатно поважен од тоа колку натриум јадете. [Забележете дека ова се однесува само на 99,999999% од човештвото кое јаде помеѓу 3k и 6k mgs натриум на ден. Солта веројатно е проблем ако јадете надвор од нормалниот опсег, како 12,000mg + натриум на ден.]<br/>Сакав во основа да го кажам истото. Имав висок крвен притисок... Направив 30 ден Палео предизвик... Сите чисти од храната на земјата. Јас всушност го зголемив внесот на сол со воведување на многу солено говедско месо и кисела храна во мојата исхрана за закуски. Не само што мојот крвен притисок заврши речиси совршена... Јас исто така изгуби 16 фунти. Јас дури и не бев некој што навистина ќе се смета за прекумерна тежина за да започне со... 178 lbs до 162 lbs во 30 дена. Убеден сум дека солта и крвниот притисок не се поврзани и мислам дека тоа е полицаец за луѓе кои навистина треба да се на вистинска здрава исхрана.<br/>Оваа статија е опасна и може да убеди некој да ја користи целата сол што ја сака. Но, се што треба да направам е да изедам неколку големи вреќи компири чипс и добивам 180/90 во рок од неколку дена, останувам надвор од солта 3-4 дена и добро хидратирам, назад до 130/70. Сега "можеби" сум преосетлив, но бидејќи ова се повтори половина дузина пати, избегнувам сол. Има многу во нормалната храна /<br/>Изгледа дека не знаете за што зборувате... прочитајте го влезот на д-р Курт Никол ДД подолу. и повторно прочитајте ја оваа статија... сте биле пристрасни од изложеноста на лекарите кои се пристрасни со години и години на сите yada..yada..yada ... прочитајте ја статијата повторно. Се разбира, нема да почнете да јадете сол покрај фунтата... сè ќе има ужасен вкус во секој случај.<br/>Она што е опасно е советите и третманите без научна основа врз основа само на хипотезата, споредниот ефект на намалување на редовниот внес на сол кај повеќето луѓе е јадењето помалку преработена храна која содржи огромни количини рафинирани или едноставни јаглехидрати, високо оксидативни масла, денатурирани супстанции, загадувачи и адитиви.<br/>Намалувањето на овие вредности ќе доведе до подобрување на целокупната исхрана.<br/>Ограничувањето на солта сама по себе без други променливи ќе покаже малку или никаков ефект кај повеќето луѓе и може да биде штетно за другите.<br/>Јас да. Влегов во детален коментар на стоп и почеток тестови кои 100% ја докажа мојата хипотеза дека Na беше еден од големите придонесувачи на крвниот притисок. Зема напор да се документираат и снимање методи и резултат. Мојот беше како висок како 205/115. Го спуштив на конзистентен 100/65 за две години. Мојата работа е документирана во овој дел за коментари, но сè уште не се појави.<br/>Многу луѓе овде велат дека јадењето вреќа чипс го зголемува нивниот крвен притисок. Зарем не сфаќаат дека тоа не е здрава храна? Дали мислат дека можеби не ги содржи сите погрешни работи?<br/>Мора да има некоја друга храна со високо ниво на натриум што може да ја користат за да покажат како солта влијае на нивниот крвен притисок.<br/>Така е... она што е лошо е маслото и мастите кои одат во цевките и ги ограничуваат... плус чипс, сето тоа е скроб, кој се претвора во шеќер, а потоа маснотии...<br/>Не би бил доволно доверлив да помислам дека солта не е поврзана со висок крвен притисок и зголемена телесна температура, бидејќи сигурно е така. Јас се намали мојот 160 над 80 крвен притисок надолу на 119 над 81 во неколку недели со намалување на мојот внес на сол сериозно. Зошто е тоа секој пат кога ќе јадат неколку порции на компири чипс, или јадат помфрит Мек Доналд, јас веднаш се соочуваат со црвенило и треска? Дури и ги почувствував и слушнав, да, стеснетите вени во мојата глава, откако имав висок крвен притисок, се проширив, се проширив и повторно се отворив, откако пиев чаши и чаши со вода, со исчезнување на треската, исчезнување на непријатност или чувство на пренатрупаност на главата и намалување на крвниот притисок.<br/>Ова навистина ме мачи, и јас t признае дека е малку збунет сега. Љубовта на сол и може да се консумираат повеќе во еден оброк отколку што треба да се консумираат во еден ден. Тоа никогаш не се чинеше да влијае на мојот Б.П.<br/>Потоа, кога мојот Б.П. почна да се зголемува како што стареам, мојот доктор рече да се намали сол. Па јас го направив ... без вистински ефект. Всушност, бев примен во болница со сериозна инфекција, само за да откријам дека кога бев отпуштен, бев на диета со ниско ниво на натриум, иако на прием, нивото на натриум беше опасно ниско.<br/>Сето ова ме натера да верувам дека опасностите од натриумот се само мит, барем за мене. Но, тогаш мојата сопруга се разболе. Нејзиниот б.п. беше постојано следен како што продолжи да оди премногу ниско. Се користеше да и се вбризга со "натриум" (солена вода верувам) и нејзиниот крвен притисок ќе дојде до речиси веднаш. Ова беше интравенозно, сепак.<br/>Па дали е тоа дека не сум чувствителен на сол, или е нешто во стомакот што делува s бариера (така што внесената сол не влијае на вас), додека IV солта ќе?<br/>За нешто што е толку фундаментално во медицинските совети, тоа е толку фрустрирачки што се чини дека има толку малку истражување, барем квалитетно истражување направено за тоа.<br/>Спротивно на тоа, на подоцнежниот прием во болница, повторно ме ставија на ниско ниво на натриум (штом идиот го стави на вашите медицински досиеја, се чини дека е невозможно да се симне...) и ми дадоа лекови за намалување на крвниот притисок. Мојот Б.П. падна низ подот и ги загрижуваше во една фаза.<br/>БП лекови не се докажани за подобрување на резултатите или да бидат безбедни во повеќето ситуации. Модерната медицина е прилично опасна тие ги убиваат луѓето постојано со она што го препишуваат.<br/>Вашата сопруга може да има проблеми со бубрезите и надбубрежните жлезди, додека вие најверојатно имате васкуларни проблеми. Размислете за можните еколошки причини, пиете вода со флуорид која ја зголемува апсорпцијата на олово, недостаток на антиоксиданси како ала, vit a / e / c / d / k2 може да доведе до зголемен оксидативен стрес артериска склероза и калцификација на артериите ограничување на способноста на весалите да дијалираат, зголеста изложеност на иритација на витаминот ја зголемува вазноста на вазата.<br/>Овие работи можат да предизвикаат проблеми насекаде.<br/>Штотуку поминав еден час пишувајќи коментар. Мојот лекар сака да го види. Јас не се појавувам. Што се случува? Дали го потрошив времето? Ве молиме одговорете.<br/>Одлична статија. Статии од овој тип извади здравје лудаци и знае-тоа-сите.... само погледнете во коментарите. Ова исто така ме потсетува на „глобалното затоплување“. „Климатските промени“ (или како и да ги нарекуваат оваа недела) „експерти“ кои го проповедаат како да е евангелие кога и тие немаат дефинитивен доказ. |
| Nomadic Kirghiz. Golodnaia Steppe.<br/>This remarkable photograph shows a nomadic Kyrgyz family resting in the steppe grasslands. The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group widely spread over the area of eastern Turkestan. The man, with weathered face, is dressed in a skullcap and a frayed traditional striped coat. He is burdened with padded blankets and probably a small tent. The woman, with brilliant white turban, wears a tattered cloak and carries smaller bundles of blankets and clothes. Their small boy wears a colorful skullcap and a sparkling green silk jacket in the Chinese style. To the left is a desert thorn bush. The image is by Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863–1944), who used a special color photography process to create a visual record of the Russian Empire in the early 20th century. Some of Prokudin-Gorskii’s photographs date from about 1905, but the bulk of his work is from between 1909 and 1915, when, with the support of Tsar Nicholas II and the Ministry of Transportation, he undertook extended trips through many different parts of the empire. In 1911 he made two trips to an area of Central Asia then known as Turkestan (present-day Uzbekistan and neighboring states), where he photographed Islamic architectural monuments as well as Russian development projects, such as an irrigation scheme to make Golodnaia Steppe (“Hungry Steppe”) a productive area for raising cotton and wheat.<br/>Photo: Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.<br/>- acku Afghanistan<br/>- Image Size<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>- Contained in galleries | Номадски Киргиски.

Некои од фотографиите на Прокудин-Горски датираат од околу 1905 година, но поголемиот дел од неговите дела се од 1909 до 1915 година, кога, со поддршка на царот Николај II и Министерството за транспорт, тој презел проширени патувања низ многу различни делови на империјата. Во 1911 година направил две патувања во областа на Централна Азија, тогаш позната како Туркестан (денешен Узбекистан и соседните држави), каде што фотографирал исламски архитектонски споменици, како и руски развојни проекти, како што е шема за наводнување за да ја направи Голоднаја Степа продуктивна област за одгледување памук и пченица.<br/>Фото: Сергеј Михајлович Прокудин-Горски.<br/>- аку Авганистан<br/>- Големина на сликата<br/>- 1800x1667 / 693.3KB<br/>Содржани во галерии |
| Prescribed burning is a tool used in native landscapes and commercial timberlands across the world. There are many reasons why a land manager might use prescribed burning to enhance or manage the land.<br/>One of the most beneficial results of prescribed burning, regardless of the intended end goal, is the reduction of fuel loads in the case a wildfire breaks out. Wildfires can be devastating for urban and rural communities across the country. In 2020, one of the worst most recent wildfire seasons in the United States, nearly 18,000 structures were lost to out-of-control fires, over half of those being homes. In the last decade, it has cost between $1.5 billion and $3 billion dollars each year for federal wildfire suppression tactics, including equipment and personnel.<br/>The top 10 most destructive fires by financial losses have occurred in California, with the largest being the 2018 Camp Fire, which incurred over $10.4 billion in expenses for those affected. Wildfires aren’t just financially impactful, they can cause major environmental damage and be a nuisance to general human activities.<br/>Of course, raging fires burning in the area means that road closures are likely, which impacts travel. In addition, smoke generated by wildfires can have strong effects on communities even hundreds of miles away as it is carried in the atmosphere. This can drop ash and particulate matter and impacts air quality, making it difficult for many to be outside. Communication can be impacted if fires approach telephone lines, cellphone towers, or even energy distribution centers.<br/>You can see why minimizing wildfires would result in a reduction to impacts to human activity.<br/>Environmental damage can be significant since wildfires often burn large swaths of lands, are high intensity, and have severe impacts. In 2020, nearly 60,000 fires in the United States, impacting over 10 million acres on the east and west coast. Typically more fires in the eastern states, but these fires are smaller in size and generally are less severe. Western states see marginally fewer fires than the East, but the western fires can be more intense and consume more acreage at once. This regional difference is generally seen because of the landscapes, the types of plants and fuel available to burn, as well as weather differences, particularly drought conditions. Wildfires impact plant communities and wildlife in the area, and overall have a negative influence on the environment.<br/>It may seem weird to fight fire with fire, but there are “good fires” and “bad fires.” Prescribed burning are like a prescription written by a doctor — the “doctor” in this case being the land manager. The prescription details what the goals of the burn are, the weather conditions when the burn should be conducted for the best results and least human impact, and the intensity of the fire to achieve the results.<br/>This prescription means that the fire will occur in a safe, controlled way with little impact on the environment or humans.<br/>Prescribed fire does more than just prevent raging wildfires, it can also benefit native landscapes, improve food sources and habitat for wildlife, or control underbrush in timber stands. Many native plants across the world are designed for fire to occur, since fires would naturally occur long before human intervention. Some plants need fire for their seed pods to open, some need other plants to be cleared out by fire so their seeds can germinate and succeed, while others are designed to withstand fire with thick, insulating bark or waxy foliage.<br/>Prescribed burners can tell you many stories of deer, turkey, quail, and other wildlife coming in immediately after a fire to consume plants and insects. Wildlife also benefit from improved nutrition in plants and better habitats in areas regenerating after a fire.<br/>Prescribed fire might be a beneficial tool for your land too. Reach out to your local forest service or prescribed burn association to see how prescribed burning might be implemented on your property. This important resource is vital to protect and encourage with the way we vote, so make sure those in office know this issue matters to you.<br/>Michelle Miller, the “Farm Babe,” is an internationally recognized keynote speaker, writer, and social media influencer and travels full time to advocate for agriculture.

Постојат многу причини зошто менаџерот на земјиштето може да користи пропишано горење за подобрување или управување со земјиштето.<br/>Еден од најкорисните резултати од пропишаното горење, без оглед на наменетата крајна цел, е намалување на оптоварувањата со гориво во случај да избие шумски пожар. Шумските пожари можат да бидат разорни за урбаните и руралните заедници низ целата земја. Во 2020 година, една од најлошите сезони на шумски пожари во САД, речиси 18.000 објекти беа изгубени поради пожари надвор од контрола, повеќе од половина од нив беа домови. Во последната деценија, таа чини помеѓу 1,5 и 3 милијарди долари годишно за федерални тактики за сузбивање на шумските пожари, вклучувајќи опрема и персонал.<br/>Десетте најразорни пожари поради финансиски загуби се случија во Калифорнија, а најголем е пожарот во кампот во 2018 година, кој предизвика повеќе од 10,4 милијарди долари трошоци за оние кои беа погодени. Шумските пожари не се само финансиски влијателни, тие можат да предизвикаат голема штета на животната средина и да бидат пречка за општите човечки активности.<br/>Се разбира, бесните пожари што горат во областа значи дека е можно да се затворат патиштата, што влијае на патувањето. Покрај тоа, чадот што го создаваат шумските пожари може да има силни ефекти врз заедниците дури и стотици километри оддалечени бидејќи се носи во атмосферата. Ова може да падне пепел и честички материја и влијае на квалитетот на воздухот, што го прави тешко за многу да бидат надвор. Комуникацијата може да се влијае ако пожари пристап телефонски линии, мобилни кули, па дури и дистрибуција на енергија центри.<br/>Можете да видите зошто минимизирањето на шумските пожари би резултирало со намалување на влијанието врз човечката активност.<br/>Оштетувањето на животната средина може да биде значајно бидејќи шумските пожари често горат големи делови од земјиштето, се со висок интензитет и имаат сериозни влијанија. Во 2020 година, речиси 60.000 пожари во САД, влијаејќи на повеќе од 10 милиони хектари на источниот и западниот брег. Обично повеќе пожари во источните држави, но овие пожари се помали по големина и генерално се помалку сериозни. Западните држави забележуваат маргинално помалку пожари од источните, но западните пожари можат да бидат поинтензивни и да консумираат повеќе површина одеднаш. Оваа регионална разлика генерално се гледа поради пејзажите, видовите на растенија и горивото достапни за горење, како и разликите во времето, особено сушните услови. Шумските пожари влијаат на растителни заедници и дивиот свет во областа, и генерално имаат негативно влијание врз животната средина.<br/>Може да изгледа чудно да се бори оган со оган, но постојат "добри огнови" и "лоши огнови". Пропишани горење се како рецепт напишан од лекар - "доктор" во овој случај е менаџерот на земјиштето. Рецептот детално ги опишува целите на изгореницата, временските услови кога изгореницата треба да се спроведе за најдобри резултати и најмалку човечко влијание, како и интензитетот на пожарот за да се постигнат резултатите.<br/>Овој рецепт значи дека пожарот ќе се случи на безбеден, контролиран начин со мало влијание врз животната средина или луѓето.<br/>Пропишаниот оган не само што спречува шумски пожари, туку исто така може да има корист од домородните пејзажи, да ги подобри изворите на храна и живеалиштата за дивиот свет или да го контролира недостигот на четка во дрвените штандови. Многу локални растенија ширум светот се дизајнирани за пожар, бидејќи пожарите природно би се случиле долго пред човечката интервенција. На некои растенија им е потребен оган за да се отворат нивните семки, на некои други растенија треба да бидат исчистени со оган за да можат нивните семиња да никнат и да успеат, додека други се дизајнирани да издржат оган со густа, изолирачка кора или восочно лисје.<br/>Пропишаните горелки можат да ви кажат многу приказни за елен, мисирка, препелица и други диви животни кои доаѓаат веднаш по пожарот за да консумираат растенија и инсекти. Дивите животни, исто така, имаат корист од подобрената исхрана на растенијата и подобри живеалишта во областите кои се регенерираат по пожарот.<br/>Пропишаниот оган може да биде корисна алатка и за вашата земја. Поврзете се со вашата локална шумска служба или пропишана изгореница за да видите како пропишаното горење може да се спроведе на вашиот имот. Овој важен ресурс е од витално значење за заштита и охрабрување со начинот на кој гласаме, па бидете сигурни дека оние на функцијата знаат дека ова прашање е важно за вас.<br/>Мишел Милер е меѓународно призната говорничка, писателка и влијателна личност на социјалните медиуми и патува со полно работно време за да се залага за земјоделството.

| The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I – Book Review<br/>The Fourth Marine Brigade in World War I: Battalion Histories Based on Official Documents. George B. Clark. McFarland, 2015. 288 pages, photographs, maps. Paperback. $39.95.<br/>The Fourth Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, was one of the more famous combat units in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of the Great War. Consisting of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion (Marine), the Fourth Brigade went through five main battles: Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont, and the closing days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.<br/>Clark, a former Marine and an author with many historical Marine Corps books to his credit, based this history largely upon official records. The book is not footnoted until Chapter 3, and then it is only sparsely footnoted. Thus, in most cases, we cannot know precisely where a given quote or information comes from. While we may assume that an operations report or field message is the origin of some data, there is nothing to tell us where we may find that information. Quotes, including entire block quotations, are left un-footnoted with no indication as to the origin of the material. Probably most of the information comes from the ten-volume Records of the Second Division, listed in the bibliography, which is grist for the Marine Corps enthusiast’s mill.<br/>The book is divided into eight chapters; the first chapter gives an overview of the Fourth Brigade’s history as a whole. Each of the rest of the chapters covers one of the battalions of the brigade, plus the brigade’s machine gun battalion. Each chapter is in turn arranged chronologically in a style reminiscent of a diary or log, with narrative falling under a given day or range of days. This arrangement makes for a disjointed overall history of the brigade; it is difficult to get the feel of how the battalions fit into the division’s role during a battle. The narrative falls into recording what seem like disjointed events without the benefit of broader context. Furthermore, the battalion/chapter arrangement ensures an amount of repetition because the same background must be repeated for each battalion, and each battle is “fought” seven times. There are many fine photographs included, and the maps are adequate, although I would prefer more maps with greater detail. Surprisingly, neither the photographs nor the maps are credited.<br/>With all that being said, it should be recognized that the author, an expert on this subject, has made an important effort to document the history of this brigade. The original sources, field messages in particular, capture the confusion and flavor of combat as experienced by the junior officers in the brigade. Historians interested in the Fourth Brigade are fortunate to have available an abundance of its field messages (or at least copies thereof). Readers who are not familiar with these messages will find those quoted in the book to be an enlightening window on the world of AEF combat.<br/>Likewise, there are some interesting tidbits to be gleaned from the extensive array of operations reports included. One example, which illustrated how the AEF learned “on the fly,” is a report written by Lt. Col. Frederick M. Wise, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, after fighting at Belleau Wood. Wise’s enumeration of twenty-three lessons learned is quoted in full and provides some interesting reading. What also comes through in these messages and reports is that, especially in the early battles, command and control issues plagued even the vaunted Marines. Platoons and companies became lost and diverged from their intended path as battalion commanders anxiously sought information via runners. It’s also interesting to see the degree of involvement at Belleau Wood by the brigade commander, Brigadier General James G. Harbord (US Army). Harbord wasn’t shy about sending messages directly to battalion and even company commanders, bypassing regimental commanders.<br/>Despite the issues and troubles, which were common to all units fighting in World War I, the 2nd Division succeeded in making an enviable record (although, it must be said, at a great cost in casualties). Most historians agree that it was one of the two best divisions in the AEF (the other being the First Division), and the Fourth Brigade did its part to earn that reputation. The success of the brigade can in part be attributed to the personal heroism of its officers and men. The author, probably using award citations or recommendations, has carefully recorded the heroic feats of individual Marines, soldiers, and Navy corpsmen; this is a valuable contribution to the history of the brigade and a fine tribute to brave men.<br/>This book will appeal to readers who are interested in the Marine Corps. For those who are not familiar with the 2nd Division, it might be helpful to first read a history of that division (for example, The Battery Press’s 1989 reprint of The Second Division, American Expeditionary Force in France, 1917-1919). That history, although a bit dry in places, will help put the action described in Clark’s book in context.<br/>Peter L. Belmonte is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and freelance historian. A veteran of Operation Desert Storm, he has written extensively on immigration and military history, and his current studies focus on the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. His most recent book, Days of Perfect Hell: The 26th U.S. Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, October-November, 1918, will be released by Schiffer Books in October. | Четвртата бригада на морнарицата во Првата светска војна - Преглед на книгата<br/>Четвртата маринска бригада во Првата светска војна: Историја на баталјонот врз основа на официјалните документи. Џорџ Б. Кларк. Мекфарленд, 2015. 288 страници, фотографии, мапи. Мека. $ 39.95.<br/>Четвртата бригада, дел од Втората дивизија, била една од најпознатите борбени единици во Американските експедициски сили (АЕФ) од Големата војна. Состоејќи се од 5-ти и 6-ти полк и 6-ти митралезен баталјон (морнарица), Четвртата бригада поминала низ пет главни битки: Бело Вуд, Соасон, Сен Мијел, Блан Мон и завршните денови на офанзивата Меза-Аргон.<br/>Кларк, поранешен маринец и автор со многу историски книги на маринците на негова заслуга, ја заснова оваа историја во голема мера на официјалните записи. Книгата не е запишана со фусноти до поглавје 3, а потоа е само ретко запишана со фусноти. Така, во повеќето случаи, не можеме точно да знаеме од каде потекнува даден цитат или информација. Додека можеме да претпоставиме дека извештајот за операции или пораката од полето е потеклото на некои податоци, нема ништо да ни каже каде можеме да ги најдеме тие информации. Цитатите, вклучувајќи ги и целиот блок цитати, се оставени без забелешка без индикација за потеклото на материјалот. Веројатно поголемиот дел од информациите доаѓаат од десеттомните Записи на Втората дивизија, наведени во библиографијата, која е наменета за мелницата на ентузијастите на маринците.<br/>Книгата е поделена на осум поглавја; првото поглавје дава преглед на историјата на Четвртата бригада во целина. Секој од останатите поглавја опфаќа еден од баталјоните на бригадата, плус митралезниот батаљон на бригадата. Секое поглавје за возврат е хронолошки подредено во стил што потсетува на дневник или дневник, со наратив кој паѓа под одреден ден или опсег на денови. Овој аранжман ја прави севкупната историја на бригадата неповрзана; тешко е да се добие чувство за тоа како баталјоните се вклопуваат во улогата на дивизијата за време на битката. Наративот спаѓа во снимањето на она што се чини дека не се поврзани настани без корист од поширок контекст. Понатаму, аранжманот на баталјонот / поглавје обезбедува количина на повторување, бидејќи истата позадина мора да се повтори за секој баталјон, а секоја битка се "бори" седум пати. Вклучени се многу убави фотографии, а мапите се соодветни, иако би претпочитал повеќе мапи со поголеми детали. Изненадувачки, ниту фотографиите, ниту мапите не се кредитираат.<br/>Со сето тоа што е кажано, треба да се признае дека авторот, експерт на оваа тема, направи важен напор да ја документира историјата на оваа бригада. Оригиналните извори, особено теренските пораки, ја снимаат збунетоста и вкусот на борбата како што ја доживеале помладите офицери во бригадата. Историчарите заинтересирани за Четвртата бригада се среќни што имаат достапни изобилство на нејзините теренски пораки (или барем нивни копии). Читателите кои не се запознаени со овие пораки ќе ги најдат оние кои се цитирани во книгата како просветлувачки прозорец во светот на борбата против АЕФ.<br/>Исто така, постојат некои интересни информации што треба да се соберат од широкиот спектар на вклучени извештаи за операции. Еден пример, кој илустрира како АЕФ научил "во лет", е извештај напишан од потполковникот Фредерик М. Вајз, командант на 2-ри баталјон, 5-ти маринец, по борбата во Бело Вуд. Набројувањето на Мудриот на дваесет и трите научени лекции е цитирано во целост и обезбедува интересно читање. Она што исто така се појавува во овие пораки и извештаи е дека, особено во раните битки, прашањата за команда и контрола ги мачеле дури и фалените маринци. Водовите и четите се изгубија и се оддалечија од нивниот наменет пат, бидејќи командантите на батаљонот вознемирено бараа информации преку тркачи. Исто така е интересно да се види степенот на вклученост во Бело Вуд од страна на командантот на бригадата, бригадниот генерал Џејмс Г. Харборд (Армијата на САД). Харборд не се срамеше да испраќа пораки директно до командантите на батаљонот, па дури и до командантите на четите, заобиколувајќи ги командантите на полковите.<br/>И покрај проблемите и проблемите, кои биле заеднички за сите единици кои се бореле во Првата светска војна, Втората дивизија успеала да направи завидлив рекорд (иако, мора да се каже, со голема цена во жртвите). Повеќето историчари се согласуваат дека тоа била една од двете најдобри дивизии во АЕФ (другата била Првата дивизија), а Четвртата бригада го направила својот дел за да ја заработи таа репутација. Успехот на бригадата делумно може да се припише на личниот херојство на нејзините офицери и мажи. Авторот, најверојатно користејќи наградни цитати или препораки, внимателно ги забележал херојските подвиги на поединечните маринци, војници и морнари; ова е вреден придонес во историјата на бригадата и убава почит за храбрите мажи.<br/>Оваа книга ќе им се допадне на читателите кои се заинтересирани за морнарицата. За оние кои не се запознаени со Втората дивизија, може да биде корисно прво да се прочита историјата на таа дивизија (на пример, The Battery Press 1989 репринт на Втората дивизија, Американски експедициски сили во Франција, 1917-1919). Таа историја, иако малку сува на места, ќе помогне да се стави делото опишано во книгата на Кларк во контекст.<br/>Питер Л. Белмонте е пензиониран офицер на воздухопловните сили на САД и слободен историчар. Тој е ветеран во операцијата Пустинска бура, пишувал многу за имиграцијата и воената историја, а неговите тековни студии се фокусираат на американските експедициски сили во Првата светска војна. Неговата најнова книга, Days of Perfect Hell: The 26th U.S. Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, октомври-ноември 1918, ќе биде обја од Schifer Books. |
