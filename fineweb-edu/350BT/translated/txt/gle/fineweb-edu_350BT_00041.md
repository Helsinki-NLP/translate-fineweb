| The workplace can be a complex environment, with numerous laws and regulations that govern the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers. In Canada, the legal framework that governs employment relationships is known as status law. Status law covers a wide range of issues, from hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety. Understanding these laws is critical for employees, who can use this information to protect their rights and advocate for themselves in the workplace. This guide will provide a brief overview of some of the most common law cases in Canada.<br/>Hiring and Termination:<br/>One of the most important aspects of status law is the hiring process. Employers must comply with anti-discrimination laws and ensure that they do not make hiring decisions based on factors such as race, gender, age, or religion. Once an employee has been hired, the employer is also required to follow specific procedures if they decide to terminate the employee. By Law includes providing the employee with adequate notice, or paying them severance if the termination is without cause. best employment lawyer Toronto can advise about it.<br/>Discrimination and Harassment:<br/>Another critical aspect of status law is protecting employees from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated unfairly based on a personal characteristic, such as race, gender, age, or religion. Harassment is any behavior that creates a hostile or offensive working environment. In both cases, employees have the right to file a complaint with their employer or with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.<br/>Wages and Hours of Work:<br/>Status law also regulates the wages and hours of work for employees. Employers must comply with minimum wage laws and ensure that employees receive the appropriate overtime pay for any hours worked over the standard workweek. In addition, employers must provide employees with breaks and time off for holidays, vacations, and sick leave.<br/>Finally, status law requires employers to maintain a safe working environment for their employees. This includes providing adequate training, equipment, and safety protocols to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. Employees have the right to refuse work if they believe it is unsafe, and employers must investigate and address any safety concerns raised by employees and represented by the best employment lawyer in Toronto.<br/>In conclusion, understanding the common cases in Canadian status law is essential for employees to navigate the workplace and protect their rights. From hiring and termination to discrimination and workplace safety, employees need to be aware of the laws that govern their employment relationship. If employees have any questions or concerns, they can seek advice from a lawyer or consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. By knowing their rights and responsibilities, employees can ensure a fair and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues. | Is timpeallacht chasta í an t-ionad oibre, agus is iomaí dlí agus rialachán a rialaíonn cearta agus freagrachtaí fostaithe agus fostóirí. I gCeanada, tugtar dlí ar chaidrimh fostaíochta. Clúdaíonn dlí an stádais raon leathan saincheisteanna, ó earcú agus deireadh a chur le hidirdhealú agus le sábháilteacht san ionad oibre. Tá tuiscint ar na dlíthe seo ríthábhachtach d’fhostaithe, ar féidir leo an fhaisnéis seo a úsáid chun a gcearta a chosaint agus chun abhcóideacht a dhéanamh dóibh féin san ionad oibre. Tabharfaidh an treoir seo forbhreathnú gairid ar roinnt de na cásanna dlí is coitianta i gCeanada.<br/>Foscadh agus Foirceannadh:<br/>Is é ceann de na gnéithe is tábhachtaí den dlí stádais an próiseas fruilithe.Caithfidh fostóirí dlíthe frith-idirdhealaithe a chomhlíonadh agus a chinntiú nach ndéanann siad cinntí fostaithe bunaithe ar fhachtóirí cosúil le cine, inscne, aois nó reiligiún. A luaithe a fhostaítear fostaí, éilítear ar an bhfostóir freisin nósanna imeachta sonracha a leanúint má chinneann siad an fostaí a fhoirceannadh. De réir an Dlí áirítear fógra leordhóthanach a sholáthar don fhostaí, nó má bhíonn an foirceannadh gan chúis. Is féidir le dlíodóir fostaíochta is fearr Toronto comhairle a chur air.<br/>Idirdhealú agus Ciapadh:<br/>Gné chriticiúil eile de dhlí an stádais is ea fostaithe a chosaint ar idirdhealú agus ar chiapadh san ionad oibre.Tarlaíonn idirdhealú nuair a chaitear go míchothrom le fostaí bunaithe ar shaintréith phearsanta, amhail cine, inscne, aois nó reiligiún. Is é ciapadh aon iompar a chruthaíonn timpeallacht oibre naimhdeach nó ionsaitheacha.Sa dá chás, tá sé de cheart ag fostaithe gearán a chomhdú lena bhfostóir nó le Coimisiún um Chearta an Duine Cheanada.<br/>Pánna agus Uaireanta na hOibre:<br/>Rialaíonn dlí an stádais freisin pá agus uaireanta na hoibre d’fhostaithe. Ní mór d’fhostóirí na dlíthe íosta pá a chomhlíonadh agus a chinntiú go bhfaigheann fostaithe an íocaíocht ‘muirearach chuí’ ar feadh uair an chloig a oibríodh thar an gnáth-seachtaeachta. Ina theannta sin, ní mór d’fhostóirí sosanna agus am saor a thabhairt d’fhostaithe le haghaidh laethanta saoire, laethanta saoire agus saoire bhreoiteachta.<br/>Mar fhocal scoir, éilíonn dlí stádais ar fhostóirí timpeallacht shábháilte oibre a choinneáil dá bhfostaithe.Áirítear leis seo oiliúint, trealamh agus prótacail sábháilteachta a chur ar fáil chun tionóiscí agus gortuithe san ionad oibre a chosc. Tá sé de cheart ag fostaithe an obair a dhiúltú má chreideann siad go bhfuil sé neamhshábháilte, agus ní mór d'fhostóirí aon ábhair imní sábháilteachta a d'ardaigh fostaithe agus a ndéanann an dlíodóir fostaíochta is fearr i Toronto ionadaíocht dóibh a imscrúdú agus aghaidh a thabhairt orthu.<br/>Mar fhocal scoir, tá tuiscint ar na cásanna coitianta i ndlí stádais Cheanada riachtanach d’fhostaithe chun an t-ionad oibre a nascleanúint agus a gcearta a chosaint. Ní mór d’fhostaithe a bheith ar an eolas faoi na dlíthe a rialaíonn a gcaidreamh fostaíochta agus iad a fhostú agus a fhoirceannadh. Má tá aon cheist nó imní ag fostaithe, féadfaidh siad comhairle a lorg ó dhlíodóir nó dul i gcomhairle le Coimisiún um Chearta an Duine Cheanada. Trí eolas a fháil ar a gcearta agus a bhfreagrachtaí, is féidir le fostaithe timpeallacht oibre chothrom agus shábháilte a chinntiú dóibh féin agus dá gcomhghleacaithe. |
| There's an old adage in the auto industry that says your vehicle loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot. The computer and technology industry is not so different, in that new parts and systems are constantly pushing the envelope of performance and value, making it impossible to have a top-of-the-line system for very long. The purpose of this paper is to step back in time 10 years and examine the technology landscape then to see how it compares to today's technologies we know and love.<br/>Much has been written, and much is still debated about the technology axiom called; Moore's Law. Some people interpret the law to mean a doubling of computer power every 18 months to 2 years, while others maintain it means a doubling of the numbers of transistors (microscopic on / off switches if you will) engineers are able to print into the same amount of silicon. In fact Moore stated that transistor counts would double every year, which he later adjusted to be every 2 years) Regardless, this trend of performance and transistor growth has held true for over 40 years.<br/>More recently, Moore's law has been applied to graphics processing units (GPUs) as well. The GPU is actually not even 10 years old at the time of writing. The official term GPU was coined with the nVidia GeForce 256 series of 3D cards. Released in August 1999, this was the first chip that was able to compute vertex transformations and pixel lighting in hardware. Since its release, graphics processing power has followed a similar trend of doubling performance every 18 months to 2 years. This article is not a technical document, rather a glimpse into the past 10 years ago to give you an idea of how far we've come in such a short time.<br/>A Little History About the Author:<br/>The year was 1999. It was my sophomore / junior year in high school. Now I'll pause so that 90% of the readers who grow up in the 70s and 80's can turn up their nose and stop reading.<br/>Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's continue.<br/>I am an internet child. I got into computers, and all manner of electronic geekery just as the Internet was becoming something that "just might catch on". My high school was not quite on the boring edge of technology as it was, but we were one of the first public schools in my area to be equipped with a full T1 line and the 1.5Mbps of awesome dedicated bandwidth that it piped through the network . Our network was built from a hodge-podge mixture of nice PC computers labs (mostly K6 200MHz / Win 95 machines), and a network engineers nightmare concoction of Macintoshes; LC II's up through new G3 iMacs.<br/>In 1999 I was still rocking a 486 DX-33 PC with 8MB of ram and Windows 3.11 as my PC at home, while my parents had a nice Pentium 100 Windows 95 machine my siblings and I would fight for time on. So what was the point of those last couple paragraphs you're probably asking? Well, that is where I was, and what I was using 10 years ago in computing, and hopefully it got you thinking back a decade to what you were computing on.<br/>10 years ago today, The computer world was working itself into a frenzy, getting ready for the near future release of the brand new Intel Pentium III Processor. The best money could do was a Pentium II processor at 450MHz with PC100 Memory. Rival AMD was doing alright for itself peddling its budget conscious K6-2 series of processors. Your average computer cost around $ 2000- $ 2500 at this time for a PC with a solid Pentium II processor. The Pentium III was due to be released on February 26th, and was the subject of a wicked debate over the merits of its built in unique ID number. Also noteworthy was its inclusion of the first SSE instruction set (The modern Core i7 processor is at SSE4 +). However without software designed to make use of the new instructions the processor was not much faster than an equivalent clocked Pentium II CPU and took quite a bit of heat from the press.<br/>On the graphics front the war between nVidia and 3DFx was raging. nVidia, a relative newcomer to the field, was riding high on top of their very successful TNT (Twin-Texel) video processor, while 3DFx was fighting to retain its market leadership title with its Voodoo3 line of graphics cards. The Voodoo cards were excellent performers, however the TNT cards had the advantage of 32 bit color while the Voodoo's were stuck at 24 bits. ATI was around and kicking with their Rage series of 3D cards (especially popular as integrated chips in servers and workstations), however they never really entered into the hardcore 3D accelerator race until the Radeon line debuted in 2000.<br/>In 1999 the internet boom was just beginning and attracting massive amounts of attention and investment capital from all over the globe. The big business of the time was in the search and portal business. Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and Lycos were perhaps the most recognizable and capable players in this industry. Google -say-wha? Other companies from other industries, such as television media, and ISPs were taking notice, and buying up internet portals right and left in an attempt to tap into the viral spread of the internet. New technologies like Java were coming into their own, and began to lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. Studies determined that by 1999 about half of US households had a computer, and most of the new computer purchases were being made to get online.<br/>PDA's were quickly becoming the new must have gadget. The Palm Pilot being the device that led the charge. I myself had a Palm IIIe toward the later half of 2000. Personal pagers were still hot sellers, but cell phones were getting smaller and more practical and affordable. Also a war was heating up in the computer memory segment. Samsung introduced new DDR memory chips that promised to double the effective bandwidth of existing memory chips in future setups, however Rambus was busy developing their own high speed RAM for use in high end Intel systems.<br/>This field is possibly a bit too large to cover here, but a brief OS recap: The PC world was running strong with windows 98, and anxiously awaiting the updated Windows 98 Second Edition due out in May 1999. The Macintosh crowd was plugging away happily on their Mac OS 8.5 Machines, while awaiting an update to OS 9 sometime later that year. Linux was also starting to come into its own, as big name vendors like IBM were starting to bundle distributions of Redhat, Caldera, and others with some servers.<br/>I'll admit this article was more for my amusement and reminiscing than anything else. I hope that somewhere in the course of this mass of words and broken sentences, you too had some good recollections of computer equipment past. It's good to remember the technologies we grow up with and we are fortunately enough to have the robust internet we are used to today to help conjure up images and technical specs of those glory days. Sites like the Tech Time Machine exist to help us relive those days, and have a few chuckles at equipment we thought we'd never use to its full potential. I remember touching a Pentium 200MMX machine for the first time and being in awe at its raw speed and seemingly infinite possibilities. Now I constantly get upset with the speed of my current 3GHz dual core Athlon X2 6000+ PC. I can not even imagine how many windows that Pentium 200 would have thrown out of today. It's a crazy world we live in. | Níl aois sa tionscal uathoibríoch a deir go gcaillfidh d'fheithicil luach chomh luath agus a thiomáineann tú é as an go leor. Níl an tionscal ríomhaireachta agus teicneolaíochta chomh difriúil, sa mhéid is go bhfuil páirteanna agus córais nua ag brú i gcónaí ar an gclúdach feidhmíochta agus luacha, rud a fhágann go bhfuil sé dodhéanta córas barr-ar-líne a bheith aige ar feadh an-fhada. Is é cuspóir an pháipéir seo céim siar in am 10 mbliana agus iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar thírdhreach na teicneolaíochta ansin chun a fháil amach conas a chuireann sé i gcomparáid le teicneolaíochtaí an lae inniu a bhfuil aithne agus grá againn orthu.<br/>Tá go leor scríofa, agus tá mórán plé déanta fós faoin axiomóid teicneolaíochta ar a dtugtar; Dlí Moore. Déanann daoine áirithe an dlí a léirmhíniú chun dúbailt cumhachta ríomhaireachta a chiallaíonn gach 18 mí go 2 bhliain, agus ciallaíonn cuid eile go bhfuil sé faoi dhó ar líon na n-trasnóirí (rómhábharach ar lasca / as a chéile más rud é go mbeidh tú) in ann innealtóirí a phriontáil isteach sa mhéid céanna sileacain. Deir Moore go mbeadh tras-aistrithe dúbailte gach bliain, rud a d’athraigh sé ina dhiaidh sin a bheith gach 2 bhliain) Beag beann ar an treocht sin d’fheidhmíocht agus d’fhás trasraoltóir le breis agus 40 bliain.<br/>Le déanaí, cuireadh dlí Moore i bhfeidhm ar aonaid phróiseála grafaicí (GPUs) freisin. Ní fiú 10 mbliana d’aois ag tráth na scríbhneoireachta. Bhí an téarma oifigiúil GPU ar aon dul leis an sraith cártaí nVIDIA GeForce 256 a 3D. Scaoileadh é i mí Lúnasa 1999, ba é seo an chéad sliseanna a bhí in ann athruithe ingearacha agus soilsiú picteilín i crua-earraí a ríomh.Ón rud é a scaoileadh, lean cumhacht próiseála grafaicí treocht den chineál céanna feidhmíochta dúbailt gach 18 mí go 2 bhliain. Ní doiciméad teicniúil é an t-alt seo, in áit spléachadh a thabhairt duit 10 mbliana ó shin le tuiscint a fháil ar cé chomh fada agus a tháinig muid i mbeagán ama.<br/>Stair Beag Maidir leis an Údar:<br/>Ba í 1999. Bhí sé ar mo bhróim/bliain sóisearach ó scoil ard. Anois beidh mé ag sos ionas gur féidir le 90% de na léitheoirí a fhásann sna 70idí agus sna 80’s a gcuid srón a iompú agus stop a léamh.<br/>Ceart go leor, anois go bhfuil amach as an mbealach seo, a ligean ar leanúint ar aghaidh.<br/>Is leanbh idirlín mé. Fuair mé isteach i ríomhairí, agus bhí an bealach ar fad de geeker leictreonach díreach mar a bhí an Idirlíon ag éirí rud éigin go "d'fhéadfadh ach ghabháil air". Ní raibh mo scoil ard go leor ar imeall leadránach na teicneolaíochta mar a bhí sé, ach bhí muid ar cheann de na chéad scoileanna poiblí i mo cheantar le bheith feistithe le líne T1 iomlán agus 1.5Mbps de bandaleithead tiomanta uamhnach a phíobáin sé tríd an líonra. Tógadh ár líonra ó mheascán fálaithe de lipéid ríomhairí PC deas (meaisíní K6 200MHz / Win 95 den chuid is mó), agus conction nightmare innealtóirí líonra de Macintoches; LC II's suas trí iMacs G3 nua.<br/>I 1999 bhí mé fós ag rocadh ar 486 LX-33 PC le 8MB de reithe agus Windows 3.11 mar mo ríomhaire sa bhaile, cé go raibh mo thuismitheoirí deas Pentium 100 Windows 95 meaisín deartháireacha agus ba mhaith liom troid ar feadh tamaill ar. Mar sin, cad é an pointe de na míreanna lánúin deiridh a bhfuil tú ag iarraidh is dócha?, Bhuel, is é sin an áit a raibh mé, agus cad a bhí mé ag baint úsáide as 10 bliain ó shin i ríomhaireacht, agus tá súil agam go bhfuair tú ag smaoineamh ar ais le deich mbliana ar an méid a bhí tú ag ríomh ar.<br/>10 mbliana ó shin, Bhí an domhan ríomhaire ag obair é féin i frenzy, ag fáil réidh le haghaidh an scaoileadh nua branda Intel Pentium III Próiseálaí., Ba é an t-airgead is fearr a d'fhéadfadh a dhéanamh ná próiseálaí Pentium II ag 450MHz le PC100 Cuimhne. Bhí Rival AMD ag déanamh ceart dó féin Pedling a bhuiséad sraith próiseálaithe comhfhiosach K6-2.Cosnaíonn do mheán ríomhaire thart ar $ 2000- $ 2500 ag an am seo le ríomhaire soladach Pentium II próiseálaí. Eisíodh an Pentium III ar 26 Feabhra, agus bhí sé ina ábhar díospóireachta wicked thar fhiúntais a tógadh i n-uimhir aitheantais uathúil. Chomh maith leis sin bhí sé ina áireamh ar an gcéad sraith teagaisc SSE (Tá an próiseálaí nua-aimseartha i7 ag SSE4 +). Mar sin féin gan bogearraí atá deartha chun úsáid a bhaint as na treoracha nua nach raibh an próiseálaí i bhfad níos tapúla ná LAP Pentium nasctha comhionann agus thóg sé beagán de teasa ón bpreas.<br/>Ar na grafaicí chun tosaigh ar an gcogadh idir nVideo agus 3DFx a bhí raging. n Vidia, núíosach coibhneasta leis an réimse, bhí marcaíocht ard ar bharr a bpróiseálaí físeáin TNT-Twin-Texel, agus bhí 3DFx ag troid chun a theideal ceannaireachta margaidh a choinneáil lena líne cártaí grafaicí Voodo3. Ba thaibheoirí den scoth iad na cártaí Voodoo, áfach, bhí buntáiste ag na cártaí TNT ar 32 giotán dath agus greamaíodh an Voodoo ag 24 giotán. Bhí ATI thart agus kicking lena sraith Raon cártaí 3D (go háirithe tóir mar sliseanna comhtháite i freastalaithe agus stáisiúin oibre), áfach, ní raibh siad riamh i ndáiríre isteach sa rás luasaire hardcore 3D go dtí an líne Radeon tús i 2000.<br/>I 1999 ní raibh an borradh idirlín ach ag tosú agus ag mealladh méideanna ollmhóra airde agus caipitil infheistíochta ó gach cearn den domhan. Bhí gnó mór an ama sa ghnó cuardaigh agus tairsí. B’fhéidir gurb iad Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, agus Lycos na himreoirí is aitheanta agus is féidir a chur ar fáil sa tionscal seo. Bhí cuideachtaí eile ó thionscail eile, mar shampla meáin teilifíse, agus ISP ag tabhairt faoi deara, agus bhí siad ag ceannach suas tairseacha idirlín ar dheis agus d’fhág siad in iarracht a dhéanamh leas a bhaint as scaipeadh víreasach an idirlín. Bhí teicneolaíochtaí nua cosúil le Java ag teacht isteach ina gcuid féin, agus thosaigh siad ag leagan na talún don idirlíon mar is eol dúinn inniu é. Chinn staidéir go raibh ríomhaire ag thart ar leath de theaghlaigh na Stát Aontaithe faoi 1999, agus go raibh an chuid is mó de na ceannacháin ríomhaire nua á ndéanamh chun dul ar líne.<br/>Bhí mé go tapa ag éirí leis an gadget nua., An Pailme Píolótach a bheith ar an gléas a stiúir an muirear., Bhí mé féin a Pailme III i dtreo an leath níos déanaí de 2000. Ba dhíoltóirí te iad leathanaigh phearsanta fós, ach bhí fóin phóca ag éirí níos lú agus níos praiticiúla agus níos inacmhainne freisin.Bhí cogadh ag téamh sa deighleog cuimhne ríomhaire. tugadh isteach Samsung nua sceallóga cuimhne DDR a gheall ar bandaleithead éifeachtach na sliseanna cuimhne atá ann cheana féin i socruithe amach anseo, ach bhí Rambus gnóthach a gcuid RAM ardluais féin a fhorbairt lena n-úsáid i gcórais Intel ard.<br/>Is é an réimse seo b'fhéidir le beagán ró-mhór a chlúdach anseo, ach athmhúnlú Sinsearach gairid: Bhí an domhan ríomhaire ag rith láidir le fuinneoga 98, agus go himníoch ag fanacht leis na Windows 98 cothrom le dáta Edition mar atá leagtha amach i mí na Bealtaine 1999. Bhí an slua Macintosh ag bualadh amach go sona sásta ar a Mac OS 8.5 Meaisíní, agus iad ag fanacht ar an nuashonrú chun OS 9 uair níos déanaí an bhliain sin. Bhí Linux ag tosú freisin ina chuid féin, mar bhí díoltóirí ainm mór cosúil le IBM ag tosú le dáileadh cuachta ar Reddit, Caldera, agus daoine eile le roinnt freastalaithe.<br/>Beidh mé a admháil an t-alt seo a bhí níos mó do mo spraoi agus a mheabhrú ná aon rud eile., Tá súil agam go bhfuil áit éigin i gcúrsa an mais na focail agus abairtí briste, go raibh tú freisin roinnt de na bailiúcháin maith ar threalamh ríomhaire am atá caite. Is maith cuimhneamh ar na teicneolaíochtaí a fhásaimid agus is dócha go mbeidh an t-idirlíon láidir againn atá in úsáid inniu chun cabhrú linn íomhánna agus sonraíochtaí teicniúla na laethanta ghlóire sin a chur i mbaol. Tá suíomhanna cosúil leis an Meaisín Am Tech ann chun cabhrú linn na laethanta sin a mhaolú, agus tá cúpla seicní ag an trealamh a cheapamar nár úsáideamar riamh dá lánacmhainneacht. Is cuimhin liom teagmháil a dhéanamh le meaisín Pentium 200MX don chéad uair agus a bheith i awe ag a luas amh agus cosúil le féidearthachtaí gan teorainn. anois mé i gcónaí a fháil trína chéile leis an luas de mo chroí reatha 3GHz Alon X2 6000+ PC. Ní féidir liom a shamhlú fiú cé mhéad fuinneoga a chaithfeadh Pentium 200 as an lá atá inniu ann., Is domhan craiceáilte é ina gcónaímid. |
| The cultural anthropology major and minor offer a holistic understanding of human diversity. By exploring, analyzing, and understanding patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors, shared histories, language, visual representations and material realities, cultural anthropology focuses on what it means to be human. Our courses address relevant concerns such as food and nutrition; urban, rural, and global adaptive strategies; environmental sustainability; and economic development. Through its comparative and engaged field research methods, cultural anthropology recognizes culture as the primary means by which humans engage in social and environmental interactions to define meaningful and purposeful lives. Cultural anthropology complements well all other undergraduate majors.<br/>Top 3 Skills Learned<br/>- Critical thinking<br/>- Qualitative research methods<br/>- Partnership & collaboration with community<br/>Usually this happens toward the end of the Introduction to Anthropology course, when you realize that anthropology opens doors to new ways of looking at relevant problems in our world.

| Fact or Myth: Sodium Raises Blood Pressure<br/>Well, Matt, it turns out a high sodium diet might not raise blood pressure, nor have any sort of adverse effect on cardiovascular health at all. But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence (and there is more evidence that says it doesn’t than does).<br/>The debate over eating too much salt has been around since the 1960s. Almost every major governmental health organization embraces the idea that eating too much salt is damaging to your health. Most major news outlets report on these recommendations and people tend to try and follow them. This is most likely why most of us, especially the elderly with heart problems, know to reduce the amount of salt we eat. Those of us who like the idea that any recommendation be backed up by solid evidence, have to step back on this one. As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.<br/>So why have most health organizations pushed the idea of low sodium diets? The theory behind their supposition is sound, and there are some studies that show a minor risk of elevated blood pressure with extremely high salt intake. Unfortunately, there are many other studies that show no increase, and still some that show reducing salt intake might actually raise your blood pressure! Let’s look at the controversy in more detail.<br/>The idea salt will increase your blood pressure has to do with osmotic pressure. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell walls), from areas of lower solute concentration (in this case salt) to areas of higher solute concentration. This naturally equalizes the solute concentration on both sides of the membrane. (This osmotic pressure is also why salt can be used to preserves meat.)<br/>So the theory goes that when we eat too much salt, our bloodstream has more sodium in it than the surrounding areas of our body. This causes the water in those areas to be pulled into our bloodstream. The increase in water within the arteries and veins causes an increase in the pressure within those arteries and veins. The salt itself also acts like an irritant within the arteries causing them to constrict. This too is thought to increase your blood pressure.<br/>The theory seems, on the surface, very sound. After all, we can make the process of salt pulling water through membranes happen time and time again in the lab. The question is, does this actually happen within our bodies, and does this actually cause long term hypertension (high blood pressure)?<br/>In 1969, Lewis Dahl testified before Sen. George McGovern’s “select committee on nutrition and human needs”. He was concerned about the high concentrations of sodium in baby foods and thought this might cause increase in people’s blood pressure long term. His reasoning was that studies done on rats showed increases in the blood pressure of the rats.<br/>The conversation about salt and hypertension began to circulate among health organizations. The National Institutes of Health, in 1972, began introducing “High Blood Pressure Education Programs”. As their evidence, they pointed out observationally, populations who ate very little sodium had low incidents of high blood pressure. They also pointed to the rat modeling. Scientists at the time questioned this, as the rat studies had them eating 60 times what the average person does. They also pointed out the populations who ate low sodium diets, also ate low amounts of other things, like sugar (which also affects osmosis).<br/>Despite their objections, publicly, the idea of high sodium diets causing high blood pressure was here to stay, and remains today. The Centers For Disease Control, The National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and many other organizations currently promote low sodium diets.<br/>Despite the seemingly unified front presented by these distinguished organizations, the controversy among scientists is extremely heated. In 1998, award winning author Taubes, published “The Political Science of Salt” in the Journal of Science. He stated, “The controversy over the benefits, if any, of salt reduction now constitutes one of the longest running most vitriolic and surreal disputes in all of medicine.”<br/>One surgeon general in a report wrote, the speed with which US federal agencies embraced sodium reduction, “stood in stark contrast to how long it had taken for recommendations to emerge on the importance of reducing blood cholesterol levels”. He also noted that the difference was even more remarkable considering the absence of published research that actually tested the theory. On the flip-side, Sir Micheal Rawlings, the chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, who promotes salt reduction diets argued that, “Guidance (in policy making) is based on the best available evidence. The evidence may not, however, be very good and is rarely complete.” Not a very strong argument for reducing salt intake.<br/>Let’s look at a few relatively recent studies. In 2008, Italian researchers began publishing the results from a series of clinical trials, all of which reported that, among patients with heart failure, reducing salt consumption increased the risk of death. These studies were followed by others which showed among Type 1 and 2 diabetics, healthy Europeans and patients with chronic heart failure, those that ate salt at the lower limit of the normal range were more likely to have heart disease than those who ate salt in the middle range of normal.<br/>In 2011, two Cochrane reviews found no evidence that low salt diets either improved or worsened peoples’ health. They stated, “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.”<br/>Even in the face of no clear scientific evidence to support it and some to the contrary, in 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Society of Hypertension all continued to promote low sodium diets as a means of controlling high blood pressure.<br/>In the end, being a medical professional and someone who needs clear evidence to make a decision about whether I get to add copious amounts of salt on my fries, I am pleased to find that so far there is very little! All the major health organizations seem to promote low sodium diets, but none have actually published consistent studies that show low sodium diets help in health, particularly not in cardiovascular health. What I find most annoying, a pet peeve of mine, is that none of these organizations tell people that the science behind their policies is controversial and they might be flat wrong. Ronald Bayer, David Merritt Johns, and Sandro Galea said it best in their article “Salt And Public Health”- “After a careful consideration of the debate over salt, we have concluded that the concealment of scientific uncertainty is a mistake that serves neither the ends of science nor good policy.”<br/>So you should you go out and smother everything in salt now? As with most things, if science hasn’t been able to answer the question definitively one way or the other, and you want to be safe rather than sorry, just go with the age old rule of “moderation in everything”. If you, like me, like to salt everything like the rim of a margarita glass and moderation be damned, at least now you can feel a little better about it as science seems to be leaning more and more towards low sodium diets being unnecessary and high sodium ones not being harmful at all.<br/>If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below, you might also like:<br/>- Why Salt Enhances Flavor<br/>- What Do the Numbers in a Blood Pressure Test Mean and What Do They Tell the Doctor<br/>- What Causes Arms, Legs, and Feet to “Fall Asleep”<br/>- Top 5 First Aid Tricks Everyone Should Know<br/>- How to Remove a Fresh Carpet Stain with Nothing But Salt<br/>- High blood pressure is neither a disease nor an illness in and of itself. It’s merely a risk factor for other problems. For instance, if you have chronic high blood pressure, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke goes up significantly. This high pressure could be caused by excessive plaque on the inside of your artery walls, making those arteries in effect, smaller. Think plumbing. When the pipes that transport fluid get smaller, the pressure that same volume of fluid exerts goes up. What happens if your blood pressure gets too high? I’ll answer that question with another one. What happens if the water pressure in your houses pipes gets too high? Your pipes burst. Same thing here. Should your blood pressure get too high, your arteries have a greater chance of bursting. If there is too much gunk inside your pipes (plaque inside your arteries), that ball of gunk could get too big and clog off your pipes! Seems bad too me! Especially, if those arteries are in your brain, or heart. It’s not like kidneys, where you have two! You spring a leak in those organs, and your family finally gets that big paycheck from your life insurance policy! Not really the best way to get paid, well, unless you’re really a jerk and everyone in your family hates you! Then they might not mind so much, but you certainly would.<br/>- Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury. For reference, 1 psi (pounds per square inch) is equal to 51.7149326 millimeters of mercury. If you were bleeding and wanted to stop the blood-loss with direct pressure, and you should, you would only need to use about 3 psi to stop it. Unless they have really high blood pressure, then maybe 4 psi. Basic math saves the day again!<br/>- The first known experiment to measure the exact pressure of blood was performed by Stephen Hales on December 1, 1733. He took a live horse. Attached a tube to her left crural artery, then allowed her blood to rush through the tube and it rose to a height of 8’3”. He noted that “when it was at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each pulse 2, 3,or 4 inches”. Yes the horse bled out, but don’t think Mr. Hales was too cruel, he performed the experiment on a horse that was about to be put down anyway! To the horse, I’m sure this distinction didn’t matter much of course. 🙂<br/>*Legal Disclaimer: While I am a medical professional, this article contains general information about medical conditions and treatments.

There, I’ve covered myself.Expand for References<br/>&#124;Share the Knowledge!&#124;<br/>I’m getting more and more convinced that salt does significantly increase my BP. Whenever I eat crisps (chips if you live in the USA) which have a fairly large amount of salt, my BP goes up significantly the next few days.<br/>I tried getting saltless crisps about a week ago and added my own “lo-salt” (a salt substitute consisting of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (salt), but twice as much as the former than the latter).<br/>Anyway the lo-salt flavoured crisps (chips) diodn’t raise my BP at all.<br/>OK I know that further experiments on myself is required. But at the moment I’m strongly suspecting salt as the culprit. I’m also suspect that sugar increases my BP too. But lots of investigation required to establish that!<br/>Maybe you have a poor potassium to sodium balance. My mum has hypertension and was on a low sodium diet but she was not getting enough potassium and her blood pressure was not stable. If you are concerned you may want to have your blood potassium level checked.<br/>Now that she is consuming enough potassium she her blood pressure has been normal for over a year while consuming sodium within normal ranges(more than 2500 mg)<br/>It’s not the sodium…. it’s the fat and starch that is making you fatter and fatter; and that, is you body mass increasing and making it harder for your heart to pump blood through the veins and arteries that get squished in your body by the increased amount of accumulated fat.<br/>you are eating pure bloody starch and pointing to salt instead of the sugar, anything to avoid incrimination of sugar not too mention vegetable oil that increases all causes of death. You get far more osmolality from the sugar<br/>Hard evidence needed? Not a myth and very easy to document — requires little intelligence or training, anyone can do it. At the age of 52-54, this was over a two year period (2005 and 2006). Used a software program (Diet Power 4 — I paid $50 for it but it is now free to download) to track food, sodium, and bicycle exercise time. Produced graphs using the pen and paper method although will do the same thing being the program had no provisions to enter data on blood pressure. A doctor taking a reading every three to six months is absolutely is of no value in my opinion if an effort is not made to take the reading under identical circumstances other than to show a general trend over several years.<br/>I found that to be of any value, for my graph type and hypothesis (now proven), it was necessary to take several readings over a period of at least five minutes or until two close (three or less numerical spread and no more than three bpm on heart rate) readings. I would take note of readings after a two mile walk or an hour of biking at a slow to moderate rate. Wide swings over five minutes quit after I got in physical shape and stayed on the diet. Professional sites recommend sitting down 3 minutes or more and taking more than one reading but I only had one or two doctors in the last twenty years doing that, some over the need to quickly see another patient. A nurse claimed the significant reason for taking blood pressure readings were the insurance companies insisting on it. She claimed some doctors did not look at the readings she took so who cares if an effort was made to get an accurate reading was her conclusion.<br/>Walk in after rushing to show up on time, climbing stairs or whatever, sit down, a nurse grabs your arm and takes your blood pressure. At one time I convinced a doctor to take a second reading after ten minutes of discussing with me my medical problems. He claimed he had seldom waited, a man with 15 years of experience although professional sites recommended waiting three minutes. Another doctor claimed he had never heard of Na effecting blood pressure (he had been an army doctor with different standards for education he claimed).<br/>Now to the results. The graphs were beautiful and showed a perfect coalition between the the five factors entered; food type, sodium amounts, exercise, heart rate, weight.<br/>I had been on blood pressure medicine for ten years with only a numerical change of 5. I also was in sedentary employment and received zero exercise. My weight was at the upper end of normal weight or slightly overweight. I would would eat typical amounts of sodium for Americans (2,000+ mg) over two days. Then various amounts of low sodium for 4 days then gradually increase over a period of several days. After 72+ hours of a low sodium diet and exercise program, my blood pressure would drop significantly. 135/90 to 110/70 over three days was typical after being on my diet plan (the DASH diet) for one month. Sugar levels and high chemical foods were also recorded as part of diet. Sodium intake showed up more than others exercise as the biggest variable. High chemical foods also showed a difference although high chemical foods often have high sodium levels.<br/>Over four day after resuming the DASH diet there would be a significant and gradual change to the upside. It takes two or more days, depending on physical activity and water consumption to dissipate the sodium in your blood is my hypothesis although I have never confirmed this from research.<br/>I suspect sodium levels for proper blood pressure varies between people and different body designs (gender, race, activity, fat vs skinny, exercise level, etc). Many people may have little if any effect from a 2,000 mg vs 600 mg of Na. I’m not one of those. It is estimated cavemen had a diet of 400 to 600mg Na. What was good enough for cavemen (who had short lives for other reasons) was good enough for me.<br/>I had to make an effort to stay at 600 mg because of my diet. The diet I was on was 200 to 400 mg if I did not force myself to use that salt shaker). Sodium is a necessary part of your diet. I found Na amounts over 1000 mg were too much for my body. I have hypertension and heart palpitations with shortness of breath. My thyroid lab readings became perfect and the doctor took me off thyroid medication and blood pressure medication. My heart palliation’s and shortness of breath at 3 to 5 a.m. every night quit after one month. All my problems resumed significantly when I got off my diet plan/exercise in recent years. Of interest one older doctor who had been in the profession for forty years claimed I was only one of two people that went from a TSH level of 0.0 to 4.0 (the upper range of normal) after quitting the medication. Thyroid problems have resumed along with blood pressure, heart and heart palliation’s. I have now resumed the diet and exercise plan and tracking. I’ll send in an update after three months.<br/>I’m only one person, so put 400 people on the same program I’ve been on and see what happens. Problem of course is finding 200 honest people out of that 400 that do not fib on the diet and exercise database or guess. It also takes will power to stick to a program. I stuck with it for ten years then quit for miscellaneous reasons. Remove the ones from the database that show no improvement who refuse to swear under oath and take a lie detector test!<br/>Salt (Sodium) DOES raise your blood pressure. I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 130/90. She told me to control my salt (sodium 1500mg limit) and I had a check up two days later with my blood pressure 108/87. Anytime I eat lots of salty foods, I get a spike in my pressure. I am definitely salt sensitive.<br/>SALT (SODIUM) DOES affect your blood pressure. You have to be careful (it sneaks up on you good) and adjust your diet to limit sodium intake and watch for signs of your pressure raising. Especially when your body behavior changes.<br/>Work out as well! If you are lazy or not that active, take 30 minute walks 5 days a week (150 minutes total) minimum to get a decent exercise.<br/>I think the point is that recommending a lower sodium diet, that maybe affects a specific set of people, those who already have hypertension and are salt sensitive, to an entire population is ridiculous. Another point is whether high salt intake leads to chronic cardiovascular problems, which is being touted as fact to the public but has no research to back it up. I consume way more sodium than the CDC recommends and my BP has never been higher than 117/70, my highest ever, normal about 100-110/65-70. Neither of our cases prove one way or the other the effects “high” sodium intake has on the general population.<br/>You may have low cellular potassium, high copper, low vitamin k2, low magnesium, low vitamin E, heavy metal toxicity such as lead, everyone is exposed to lead and fluoride, these things compound each other.<br/>Look at conditions that cause you to have this salt sensitivity such as low potassium high cortisol.<br/>Don’t just rest on salt because you likely will have multiple issues as well almost no-one just eats salt by itself.<br/>Salt is generally found in high simple sugar no fiber foods with additives.<br/>Understand guidelines are for the whole population not just for you, this is problematic because unrefined salt is not shown to be unhealthy for most people and to some it improves health and in making these guidelines with no recognition of biochemical individuality.<br/>Understand lowering HBP is not the be all and end all, this has been mechanically done by drugs in studies which show no improvement in outcomes and even worsening of symptoms outside of the sign of BP measurement.<br/>Things to consider, Olive leaf extract, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin k2, potassium, curcumin, stevia(the natural sweetener), magnesium, pomegranite, l-arginine, nattokinase, fish oil, cocoa, beetroot, alpha lipoic acid, bromelain, flax seed, celery, coq10, flax seed, hawthorne. All these improve BP and cardiovascular issues. You have a lot more in your toolkit than you think<br/>As for Sugar, women should limit their sugar (Total Carbs is what matters and watch out for certain sugar alcohols) 20g-30g a snack and 30g-45g each meal. Men should keep their snack the same as women 20g-30g a snack and 60g – 75g a meal. The lowest numbers are the lmit for diabetics of course.<br/>I believe that some people have a sensitivity to sodium. I’m convinced that I do. After being on 3 different BP meds at one time and still having uncontrolled hypertension, I started reading food labels and drastically reducing my sodium intake. Most processed foods are loaded with sodium. I have been able to stop 2 meds completely and reduce the third one to 1/4 the prescribed dosage. For me, reducing sodium has made a huge difference. Last night I took 10 mg of lisinopril, which is 1/4 of the prescribed daily dosage. Today my BP is too low, 105/48. I really have to consistently monitor it, as low BP isn’t much fun, either.<br/>Blood pressure drugs are ineffective, they fail to improve outcomes only the BP reading.<br/>You have reduced your intake of low potassium high salt high sugar low fiber junk foods, this was always going to lower your blood pressure.<br/>Salt is not the enemy you just require potassium and antioxidants to balance it out and lower stress.<br/>When people reduce sodium in this way you cant contribute it to salt itself, you have completely altered your dietary intake of many things, this is how people can be fooled into thinking its a single thing.<br/>This attribution of a singular cause to problems is constantly done in hypothesis and they tend to be completely bogus demonizing singular things like Co2, salt, saturated fat, cholesterol, lack of seratonin, even lack of the poison fluorides use.<br/>These are all myths that fail under scrutiny but continue to be upheld as causes by regulating bodies by cherry picking and dismissal of minimization of overwhelming contradictions. The pharmaceutical junk food and vegetable oil corporations benefit and misinform the public for profit to which the FDA racketeers for them killing off their competition.<br/>Medicine research and much of other research is a cesspool of incestuous deception between private interest and boosting the economy as well as politicians doctors and government profit.<br/>The editors of the journals studies are published in find most studies to be entirely lacking, conclusions to be spun towards confirmation bias and that we are in quite a dark age for science where belief, consensus and peer review are less about good science and more about blackballing competing belief and evidence that will damage profits and future grants.<br/>Yea, whatever. Believe what you want. I have been reading health books for years….DECADES…and I’ve have read in them EXACTLY what is printed in this article. There NEVER has been a proven link between salt and high blood pressure. Furthermore, in one of books it pointed out that salt is used to make stomach acid, and it’s ironic that as we age, the low sodium diet so often touted leads to digestive problems.<br/>Keep believing doctors who take 3 credits of Nutrition in college and pitch compounds that cause worse side effects than the actual disease.<br/>Doctors, who say Chiropractic is “not real medicine.” Read the Winsdor papers. A doctor who set out to prove Chiro was fake by doing autopsies found that 99 out of 100 organ failures were due to lack of nerve energy caused by “subluxations” which pinch the nerves and interrupt nerve energy flow. (I’m not a chiropractor).<br/>Go read books by Norman Walker, (especially “Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.”), TC Fry, and Herbert M. Shelton (Superior Nutrition, Fasting can save your life). I’ve read them all.<br/>BOTTOM LINE this is an excellent article and I’m actually surprised to see the truth so openly posted in an article like this…but you believe what you want & take chemicals pushed by the medical profession…eat what you want, drink what you want, don’t exercise and when things go wrong just take a pill….<br/>I attempted to look up these “Winsdor Papers” and even Google doesn’t know what you are talking about. If you really want to win people over, you should actually post links to the information you want us to read.<br/>Guys you all are missing one point: sodium is poisonous to us. Even if does not raise BP, its still poison ;/ not good at all<br/>@Marco: You would die instantly without sodium in your body.<br/>I am not the same Marco as Mr. “Salt is poison”. Just to be clear<br/>Of course – everything in excess is bad – heck, even drinking too much water will kill you.<br/>Now, every person is different so you have to find what works for you. Mine, I like salted 🙂<br/>This article is misleading. Just because salt’s negative effect on blood pressure is a “theory” doesn’t mean we should ignore it. In fact most of medicine and science is carried out on plausible theories. The truth is a low salt diet is less harmful than a high salt diet and like all things the real moral of the story is moderation. Also this author contradicts themselves by saying there is “no evidence… Yes none” to support this theory, but then goes on to cite at least one study that shows the negative corrolatuon in humans and another involving rats. That’s evidence, at least some not none. Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that. Sure sometimes we are far from knowing but in this case there’s enough science behind salts impact on BP to make it worth considering. Also remember the human consumption of high salt quantities is a fairly new thing on the evolutionary scale, so it’s impact on our bodies is fairly unnatural.<br/>@Mike: “No evidence… Yes none” I think Scott is meaning “No reputable evidence” Or, rather, “No evidence that is not flawed.”<br/>“Everything in moderation” Yep, exactly. As Scott is fond of saying, “Even water will kill you in high enough doses.” He even once told me a story of a woman he attempted to treat for this very thing- she drank massive amounts of water and ended up dying from it.<br/>“Most of medicine is black magic and many doctors will admit that.” I don’t think any doctors would ever say that. Maybe a century or two ago. But there is an amazing amount of good science involved here these days. We are far from knowing everything, but it’s certainly not black magic or just guess work, as that would seem to imply.<br/>Sorry to disagree with you Dave. But even on the sources of the video, the rise of blood pressure on high-salt diets is evident. While in the end of one of them, while talking about softdrinks and snacks companies:<br/>“Some of these companies have been preeminent in trying to create an artificial controversy doubting the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure,16,17 presumably in the hope of stopping or slowing down any reduction in population salt intake to protect soft drink sales.”<br/>Even, I’m not a specialist in the area, the lacks of a literature review in source about this matter is disturbing.<br/>oh diets that are processed foods with low fat high sugar high additive, observational studies are meaningless, these people are eating copious amounts of sugar each year. If you think corporations are trying to be allowed to use more salt its ridiculous distraction in doing anything to not look at the sugar metabolism syndrome epidemic.<br/>How moronic that you think observational studies matter for anything other than proposing a hypothesis, you then use intervention and double-blind placebo studies with no variables to prove them causal. THIS IS NOT DONE, this is also not done for cholesterol or saturated fat. You are a gullible victim of pathological science, when he says there is no evidence there is no evidence observational studies do no control for anything they are not an experiment, this is not how science works. You do understand cochrane are perhaps the most neutral group for clinical study in the world and they reviewed 150 trials and 13 population studies. Here you are saying their findings are wrong based on what? nothing other than your belief based on a hypothesis with no evidence.<br/>I suggest you read the book “Salt”. It is mostly a geopolitical historical account of salt in our civilization, but it also has a good deal of science in it. We built our civilization on salt.<br/>The first paragraph says ” just realize it is just a theory and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence,” I believe that since this is a scientific minded website it shouldn’t use the word theory in this context, since in science, a theory is an accepted explanation of a phenomenon, proven by testing.<br/>Yeah, he should have used hypothesis. I’m going to have to look up the history of theory and see if anyone knows how it ended up with two such different meanings.<br/>For a medical professional (which leads to an assumption of advanced education), you have a horrible grasp of grammar and spelling. This discredits much of what you say, in my mind. Having someone else review your work before publishing would go a long way.<br/>I will continue to listen to my cardiologist on this matter and limit my salt intake.<br/>@Mark: Something you’ll find seemingly true about a large number of medical professionals, the stereotype of their handwriting being horrible is generally correct. (Scott’s is particularly bad.) And their technical writing can also sometimes be particularly terrible, pre-edit. (They study medicine and the human body, not writing, after all) But, in over 100+ articles Scott has written, he has never been shown to be wrong on a main point (and only a few cases of being wrong on a minor point). Typos? Awkward sentence? You will always find at least one of these in each of his articles, despite my sincerest efforts to get rid of them all. But in the end, I care about accuracy much more than grammar. Both would be good, but finding a writer of Scott’s particular expertise and ability to think critical and process vast amounts of medical knowledge is extremely difficult. These people aren’t a dime a dozen. 🙂<br/>But really, the strength of Scott’s arguments are never based on his extensive medical knowledge. That just helps him thoroughly vet the various studies on the subject where most would get lost in the terminology, let alone be able to think critically about them and their methodology. The strength of the argument is the studies themselves. In this one, you’d do well to actually read the two Cochrane reviews, and perhaps forward them to your cardiologist for his/her thoughts.<br/>Don’t be surprised if he/she has already ready them though, and maybe even agrees with them. What doctors tell their patients doesn’t always line up with what they actually know or believe to be true. Particularly in cases like this where lawsuits may be a very real possibility if they told you to eat all the salt you wanted, then you died of a heart issue (but having nothing to do with the salt), then your family sues them and cites what various government agencies say on the subject, rather than what the medical world actually thinks. 🙂 Watching your sodium isn’t likely to hurt either, but covers the cardiologists’ backside. (I actually had an interesting discussion about this with Scott just last night about a doctor he was discussing this with who said something very similar as to why despite that he knows sodium isn’t going to be harmful in this way, he still tells certain of his patients to watch their sodium intake.)<br/>In the end, as I always say, “Question everything,” but also when questioning, do the research to find the answers too, and then double check that research just to make sure. 🙂 And, maybe don’t make the mistake of equating grammar and writing ability with knowledge of a subject or intelligence. I’ve worked with a ton of writers. I can say, journalists (and other such people with a writing background) are great at writing… They almost all are horrid at research, which surprised me on the journalists, but maybe explains a lot about the state of media reporting on scientific studies. Funny enough, the best combo of writing ability and research seems to be lawyers. They are phenomenal at both in my experience. Scientists, or people with a science background, tend to be poor at writing, but incredible at research and critical thinking. Of course, that’s only going with a sample-size of a few dozen writers I’ve worked with, and there is one exception I’ve found in that, but it’s a trend I’ve observed.<br/>I think everyone must be different. For me salt raises my blood pressure a lot. I check the bl pr 4-6x a day. Stays low enough when i stay under 300 mg of salt. As soon as i eat a lot of salt, like chinese food or even a meat and cheese sub or two slices of pizza my bl pr goes to 170/98. It takes a couple days to get the salt out of my body. Then it will go down to 130/80 and sometimes a bit lower. I am 67.<br/>you just offered up things containing large amounts of simple carbohydrates, also containing wheat. Sugar has high osmolality but is ignored due to the weight applied to salt<br/>Dietary wheat elimination alone can lower bp by 20-40 mmHG. The company life extension says this also beneficially optimizes blood lipid profiles.<br/>Do you see how you are perhaps basing what you see on assumption based on what you have been told based on the hypothesis that has no evidence.<br/>cardiovascular issues in observational studies only found a correlation with people eating the very large amount of 5 grams of salt a day, you can imagine what amount of junk foods they are eating to attain this amount.<br/>If your problem is salt you have an underlying condition causing it because you are not getting a high amount in any way, however you are also ignoring other causes which is the problem when singular things are touted as the main contributing factor when no evidence suggests they are the cause.<br/>consider your cellular potassium, copper, lead exposure, magnesium, vitamin E intake, coq10 levels, irritants and stress that can increase coagulation and vessel constriction.<br/>If I may comment on the whole spelling/grammar controversy… in my experience from observing people, the populace (at least the intelligent ones, my whole family is high IQ and my husband is a genius, literally, and as I have no lower-intelligence friends for a control group, I can only speak from my observations of my family and husband’s family,) is divided into two types: math-people and word-people. My father was a math person, as was I when I was very small, however, I lived with my mother, who is most definitely a words person, my whole life, leading to my developing into a words person. My husband may very well be the smartest person I’ve ever met, but from his spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, you’d never know it. He’s a computer repair tech, can fix anything, highly versatile in his job abilities, can solve algebra problems that I’m struggling with for minutes at a time with just a glance, but can’t spell our son’s name.<br/>As far as I can tell, scientists tend to be math people more than word people. (Just for the record, one of my previous jobs was research, and I’m a grammar Nazi and sesquipedalian. 😉<br/>I was wondering if I could ask the author of this article for a small favor.<br/>At the beginning I read this sentence in regard to salt intake:<br/>“But I’ll cover the theory on why salt raises blood pressure below- just realize [it is just a theory] and one not backed up by much of any hard scientific evidence…”<br/>Here you are using “Theory” in its popular parlance. WHich is fine and all. The problem is that this is a scientific related article and when a theory is not supported by evidence we call it a “Hypothesis”.<br/>Those of us that write in the scientific realm should make an effort to make this distinction, mostly because the next time I get some Young Earth Creationist telling me evolution is “just a theory” I swear I am going to start jumping up and down like a Chimpanzee and make backward sammerault. Then I’ll throw feces at him/her.<br/>I am sure you don’t want such a scene to become reality. Heck, you probably don’t want to think it up in your mind.<br/>So let’s start a campaign to call a Theory a “a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena” and call anything that is meant to be pulled from one’s rear orifice an “Hypothesis”.<br/>BTW: I know the dictionary return both meanings. FOr the sake of Science, let’s change the meaning back since we already have a good working word for “I just pulled this out of my ass”.<br/>@Marco: That’s a good point. I’ll start working that distinction in to future articles. 🙂<br/>Not a single legitimate conclusion can be drawn from a single blood pressure measurement. BP varies widely even from moment to moment. I have many times seen 160/100 drop to 130/75 over the course of a few minutes. As well, BP measuring equipment is highly variable and susceptible to wide variations from things like cuff size and user variations.<br/>Any conclusions drawn from a few measurements are nothing more than speculation and wishful thinking.<br/>First, this is not a peer-reviewed journal article. I agree, the correct use of “theory” has been obfuscated by the colloquial “just a hunch” version. But, let’s move on, ok?<br/>I don’t get that the article is in the least bit misleading. I do get that the author makes the point that apparently is lost on many — “As stated, currently there is no solid evidence that salt will chronically raise your blood pressure. Yes, none.”<br/>He also mentions to think critically. So, if you don’t believe him, a) continue with your belief, or b) find out for yourself. Do the legwork. Read the articles. Now you have a starting point. Thank him for that.<br/>In my opinion, focusing on the occasional grammatical error or “theory vs. hunch” debate unnecessarily diminishes the author’s intent. My takeaway is that this article helps challenge my assumptions about what I thought was already scientifically concluded. I learned something. That’s the point.<br/>@Michael Stelly I am not sure if you were referring specifically to my post in regard to the usage of “theory”, but I assure you that my comment was not intended to criticize the writer at all. At least not in the same terms as a grammatical or spelling “error”.<br/>My comment is not about an “error” rather it is a suggestion that those of us that read and write about science do our part to reclaim the usage of the word “theory” from the mainstream or that at least we try.<br/>There are those that comment on obvious spelling errors and I agree they are not important in the context of the information provided in the article (although I agree they can be distracting and I am speaking from a non native English speaker), but unless their number and character is such that they make understanding the article difficult or even impossible, you won’t find me posting about them.<br/>The word “theory” on the other hand is a word that is being actively used by certain factions of the science / religion discussion to discount 200 years of scientific advancement and it is being actively used to mislead children into discounting science as a whole.<br/>If you have watched the Nye – Ham debate, Gawker asked some creationists to write a question to evolution supporters on a piece of paper and they published these questions in the form of pictures. Invariably the “it’s just a theory” question appeared.<br/>It’s in that spirit that I have asked the curators of this website to try to use the word in its scientific meaning. If we in the science and technical fields don’t do that, we cannot expect those that want to distort science for their objectives to do it on their own.<br/>So, with all due respect, I won’t take your advice. I will certainly let slide silly spelling errors but this is important to me and it should be important to all of us that love science.<br/>no one distorts science more than evolutionists, inference and speculation based on an assumption of fact are not evidence. No field has as many hoaxes and assumptions as evolution.<br/>Continuing to use the flawed contrasting argument and assumption that because creation must be wrong evolution must be true is not science, the evidence does not show macroevolution to be possible at this point under any of the many current competing theories based solely on mutation and natural selection. I would suggest another mechanism must be found.<br/>As it stands contradictory evidence is completely ignored or even claimed as evidence of a more complex process but still a proof of evolution when it is no such thing in all cases.<br/>We currently have evidence for abiogenesis that it is an absolute fact as is microevolution absolutely correct, however, in terms of macroevoltuion I would suggest science returned to being based on evidence not an assumption of fact and skewing of data to induce it too fit the theory.<br/>As it stands evolution is not science it is a belief much like the big bang theory which has massive conflicting evidence that in the past when people used evidence to prove or disprove theories this theory would have been shelved, the combination of both these theories is akin to a religion, the religion of secular humanists. It is as political as they come the communities that uphold these beliefs black ball and ad hominem they cannot stand on the evidence but on intimidation. Studies show ad hominem is as useful as reasoned argument, this is used by illigitamate science suche as Co2 based climate alarmism and macroevolution which currently do not have evidence in their favor yet use the same types of propaganda and attacks suggesting anyone opposing them is anti-science or a moron.<br/>I suggest reading http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>People who do not agree with evolution don’t automatically believe creation, the evolutionist always attacks and distracts from their own weak argument creates their own strawman of what others believe and assume based on their own often moronic assumptions that they are backed by evidence when they are not.<br/>One fact I would like to add:<br/>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are another piece of evidence in this controversy. Interestingly, thiazides are called diuretics but when taken daily this diuretic effect becomes almost zero. After a period of chronic thiazide therapy, the primary benefit these medications provide is that they increase the elimination of sodium and chloride ions from the blood by way of the Na/Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule (along with other effects such as retention of calcium). Despite losing the diuretic effect thiazides retain their blood pressure lowering effects long-term and are one of the medications used first line for lowering blood pressure. This lowering effect is generally attributed to the elimination of sodium and seems to be in line with the idea that high sodium levels do increase blood pressure.<br/>Believe it or not. Salt appears to lower my BP. If I eat too many chips I actually get dizzy from low BP. Can’t say I get it.<br/>This “theory” is simply stupid. Salt DOES increase blood pressure big time! It’s a fact, observed, monitored. Accidentally eat some pretty salty stuff one day than needed a week of diuretics to get rid of all that salt from the body and bring the blood pressure from 190-200 (!!yes, that high it got!!!) back to normal (120-130). So don’t tell stories which aren’t true.<br/>Not all people respond the same to dietary salt. My suggestion for us is to take note of the sodium level in our normal lab results in minimal annual physicals.<br/>From childhood, I am used to take more salt with my meals, but never faced the problem of High BP, instead sometimes it goes below normal. I Googled this problem & came to the conclusion that my body needs salt more than normal to compensate for genetically transmitted ‘Low BP’ problem. So? Your Brain is the instructor for your health. You must follow its orders to stay Really Healthy!<br/>Well, I’m just a nutritionist (like a University Nutrition major that will be graduating in May) and maybe what I learnt is bull, but after being thought about the pathophysiology of how sodium can impact blood pressure, I find that the recommendation makes sense, but you would need to do more than just cut sodium. One thing that’s important is the sodium: potassium ratio (ie you eat a bunch of high processed, sodium added foods compared to fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables). I’ll admit that not everyone is salt sensitive and that we have consciously decided, in the health field, to assume that everyone is because testing for salt-sensitiveness (if that’s a word!) is expensive, long, and impractical. But the idea that there is no good plausible evidence linking salt and hypertension is false. Here’s just 6 articles. These aren’t the ones that were given by our professors to read (though if you want me to find them for you I’m sure I can), but they’re good one’s nonetheless and you don’t need a special University code or membership to access them. Anyways, here you go in case you want to read more:<br/>Do any of those show that there’s a correlation without other factors? You say “you would need to do more than just cut sodium”… is there evidence that doing those other actions without cutting sodium doesn’t work as well as cutting sodium too?<br/>Did you not read? Cochrane used 150 trials and 13 studies right? so you have 6, this is your “education” at work. Brainwashing and then confirmation biased search for support of the faulty hypothesis that has been found to be not of high quality already.<br/>If Cochrane did not use it it is not a high quality article, if it did then the support was not significant in the article. The osmolality mechanism applies to high sugar diets yet its all about salt<br/>The problem here is low quality studies are published constantly that people infer causation from where they can’t possibly do so as they did not control all the variables.<br/>The same thing is done for the lipid hypothesis and the cholesterol hypothesis.<br/>These are also myths, cholesterol from all data is inversely related to heart disease slightly.<br/>Statins absolute risk reduction for heart disease is 1.4% this is hardly significant, statins effects for decreasing heart problems in those already having a heart attack may be entirely due to their effect as an anticoagulant. Once again pathological junk science is being used to push treatments without recognizing mechanisms and variables. Most people will be harmed by inhibiting vitamin k coq10 and cholesterol synthesis via statins yet doctors backed by pharmaceutical greed promote giving them to everyone.<br/>Saturated fat has no mechanism via which it can raise cholesterol, no study of oil replacement purely substituted fat for oil in double blinds controls all variables and the closer they come to doing so the worse the outcomes for PUFA intervention becomes increasing all causes of death.<br/>Like is said the trials are low quality there is not much will to overturn hypothesis that regulating bodies and doctors have a religious belief in that is not backed by evidence. This misinformation leads to poor health and pharmaceutical profit.<br/>I have been torn between to eat more salt or not, because eating more salt reduces my heart rate and BP and makes me sleep better; my hands and feet feel full and warm. My sweat volume increase as I bike or walk. But then after taking it for a week or 2 then I notice that BP becomes persistently high; which makes me feel I did wrong by eating. What this article mentions is fluid volume increase which is interesting. Before increasing my salt intake my fingers feel thin. Maybe after fluid levels feel normal cut back on salt to normal levels. So I am just hypothesizing that people who have are salt sensitive have good fluid volume and should watch salt intake, others can take salt but stop when it feels full. Basically use salt maintain fluid volume.<br/>Based on self-experimentation, I think maintaining fluid volume is very important. At times, I find that I feel thirsty and drink water and that it keeps coming out; that calls for some salt intake. Basically, I do not eat canned food or much fast foods, my salt intake is what is purposely added in cooking. After exercise, (eating by the book and working out etc cause problems too) I notice that when I stand up from sitting position, I feel dizzy but not normally. I think I may be sweating out salt and , of course, I drink a lot of water during the exercise. I am not proposing eating more salt. What I am stating is the way the body is telling you that your salt is depleted is when you are not feeling full in your feet and hands. I think this is correct to some extent, as the body works more on concentration of things than the absolute amounts. It is not a comprehensive theory as there are other things that may increase blood volume, you may be already having too much salt in blood etc. For the record, my sodium in the blood is always near the low end of the range so my err wont push me outside of the range.<br/>Ok what is the conclusion? do I use the salt shaker now or not? I have been holding too long.<br/>I think this article is irresponsible in that salt absolutely does raise bp in those who have a salt sensitivity. If I eat something very salty I can literally go into hypertensive crisis in a matter of an hour.<br/>This type of sensitivity is common and to not mention it (because it does not fit with the authors theory?) is dangerous.<br/>@Jim porter: “because it does not fit with the authors theory?” The “author’s theory” doesn’t exist. That’s really not what we do here. This is an article simply writing about scientific studies on the topic and saying what they say, so you don’t have to sift through them and all the medical jargon; we do it for you- essentially what we write about reflects the current state of human knowledge on the subject at hand. If it changes at some point, we update the article. In this case, however, most notably the two Cochrane reviews are pretty convincing: “After more than 150 random clinical trials and 13 population studies without and obvious signal in favor of sodium reduction, another position could be to accept that such a signal may not exist.” There are exceptions to every rule, and seemingly you are one and that’s very interesting if so and it would be interesting to learn the root cause. But, again, we look at what the scientific studies say and try to reflect that in what we write. Essentially we write a form of “light-reading” style entertaining survey papers on subjects, rather than write research papers.<br/>Stressing about salt will likely kill you long before salt itself will. Do what makes you happy and you will likely live longer than otherwise; and even if you don’t, at least you’ll enjoy the time you have.<br/>I believe the problem is when salt is mixed with fat and THAT causes high blood pressure. For example, someone talked about theirs rising when eating crisps/chips-that’s because the chips contain fat. The same would apply say to french fries or other fatty dishes. However, if you were to sprinkle salt on something like fruit, it wouldn’t have the same effect and not raise your blood pressure.<br/>I do think sodium gets a bad rap and some people actually do consume too little. I think having salt with fruit or salads is o.k. but the problem is the salt/fat combination and if you think about it, that’s where people usually get their salt-in potato chips, french fries, heavily seasoning meats, in creamy dishes, etc.<br/>The person who wrote this article adds nothing of value to the discussion about high blood pressure except to encourage people to stick their heads in the sand.<br/>I have been wrestling with high blood pressure for about 12 years since a serious accident caused me to be physically inactive for about a year after the accident.<br/>High blood pressure can be controlled with and without medications and individuals respond differently to different treatments and there are natural cures for this affliction.<br/>High blood pressure can cause strokes, brain hemmorhages and contribute to diabetes and kidney disease.<br/>The balance between potassium and sodium in our blood is very critical and unfortunately most doctors don’t have a clue about the effect that nutrition and proper hydration has on this condition.<br/>Most of the doctors I have been to just give out prescriptions which may or may not work.<br/>There are natural substances which have enabled me to lower my blood pressure within a few days from extremely high to almost normal while doctors and pharmacists will say that medications (like Cozaar and Norvasc)may take up to a month to work.<br/>I’ve found that the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water<br/>had significant effects.<br/>Drinking this once or twice per day has had a very significant effect in my case; my blood pressure went from 220/95 to 130/90 within 3 days.<br/>Garlic (deodorized) also helps and fruit or vegetable juices with lowered salt content and high potassium content also help. (V-8 low salt or V-8 green).<br/>This is not wishful thinking; it has to do with chemistry; this doesn’t mean that everyone will respond the same to these treatments but I disagree very strongly when someone says that salt has no effect<br/>on blood pressure.<br/>This seems to me to be irresponsible and cavalier, unless of course you work for one of the salt manufacturers.<br/>Salt is necessary and most table salts have iodine in them, which is an essential nutrient for humans.<br/>Drinking sufficient amounts of pure water is also very important; something that my doctors never bothered to mention.<br/>This enables the body to rid itself of excess salt and helps the body cleanse itself.<br/>There are many natural substances and some foods (like pesto) which can help lower blood pressure and you can find many posts on the internet about them.<br/>Web Md and The Mayo Clinic both have posts on the subject and I trust them a hell of alot more than the author of this post.<br/>This appears to me to be an exercise in defending the indefensible.<br/>To what purpose?<br/>Who was Hippocrates anyway and what the hell did he know?<br/>I have extremely low blood pressure. If I stand up too fast, I’ll faint flat on my face. My doctor told me to eat as much salt as I want, no worries.<br/>In any case, I’ll take all of this advice with a pinch of… you know what. ;-D<br/>I eat a lot of salt (and I do mean a *LOT*). A few years ago after getting fed up with constantly being told how bad this is, I decided to put it to the test. As a Ph.D. I know how to scientifically plan a test, and over several months minimizing as many variables as possible, I tested my blood pressure while at my regular salt intake versus low salt intake. The results were pretty much as expected, although some people /may/ be slightly intolerant to relatively high levels of salt intake, for me there was no difference at all. I have returned to eating food the way I like it (salty), and tell anybody who advises against this they simply don’t know what they are talking about LOL<br/>I’m 27 female. I started having high blood pressure while I was taking Accutane a year and a half ago (Accutane increases cholesterol buildup). What I experienced was intense, my pulse was at 120bpm, I was dizzy, my hands clamped up into an unusual claw shape and they tingled until they lost feeling. I thought I was actually dying. I was told it was just a panic attack, but I’ve never had any real anxiety issues. I was given oxygen for an entire hour when suddenly I started craving salt. I asked my friend to run to mcdonalds and get me some extra salty fries. Within minutes of eating all that salt, my blood pressure was back to normal, my hands got their feeling back, and I could walk and breath normally again.<br/>I find the things that trigger it the most for me are a lack of sleep, not eating anything all day, corn, wheat, and chemical salts such as MSG. But sea salt and normal table salt don’t make it worse, they make it better! With that said, I’ve always had blood test results showing high levels of potassium. Could this somehow be involved? My Dr. Just shrugs it off as caused by my love for potatoes and citrus fruits lol<br/>You might need a new doctor high potassium or hyperkalemia can cause the episodes you describe and Accutane can cause hyperkalemia.<br/>Potassium and sodium are obviously related as your cells constantly exchange these into and out of cells to maintain higher intracellular concentrations of potassium.<br/>Cortisol which raises with sleep deprivation, not eating and other stresses reverses this process of potassium concentration into the cell, but is meant to increase potassium excretion, cellular uptake of sodium absorption and sodium retention in the kidneys, there may be something going wrong with this process with potassium not being excreted. The normal reason is the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system which regulates blood pressure.<br/>Salt nourishes adrenals but you might want to get some more vitamin C which is concentrated there as well as in the pituitary gland as these regulate your cortisol and vit c lowers cortisol and stress likely lessening the severity of episodes.<br/>Things to look into, magnesium, vitamin e, adrenal glandular, copper/zinc levels, kidney and adrenal function.<br/>Pharmacist here. Thank you for all the helpful comments on this site. One can see all the intelligently written posts from people who have reduced their high blood pressure by limiting salt. I am one of these people. My blood pressure a year ago was running on average 180/120 when not medicated, and when on 3 different medications, on average 140/90. After feeling awful, either from adverse effects from the meds or from headaches from high blood pressure, I decided to alter my diet. The results I achieved were stunning. Blood pressure perfectly normal, 120/80. No headaches, or feeling like my throat was swollen, or feeling like my head was too hot….I could go on and on. I did this with NO expensive products. I just, as much as is possible nowadays in the U.S., ate non-processed foods, and avoided all added salt. Notice, all “added” salt. As many have correctly pointed out, salt is necessary to human life. And many foods naturally contain all the salt we need, so it is not necessary to add any. Listening to these supposed experts, I wonder how any humans ever survived 10,000 years ago if they weren’t lucky enough to find a salt block to lick every day! I read one comment about someone who has had good results from “the juice of one lemon with zest or essential oil added to 16 ounces of mineral water”. I would challenge him and others to just try the lemon juice with water. I find that if I clean myself out with just one glass of lemon-water once a week, it has had a splendid effect on my health. The other ingredients may help, but it would be an interesting experiment for you. So I, like, many, many others, am sensitive to salt. Maybe some people can eat a huge amount of salt on a regular basis with no adverse health effects. That is not true for many of us, and it is offensive when so called “professionals” or “scientists” dispute this. One thing I always tell my patients, “When it comes to your health, trust yourself above all others”. If you are convinced a particular medication is making you feel sick, and your doctor or pharmacist imply it’s all in your head, trust yourself, not them. If you, like me, feel a thousand times better when you limit your consumption of salt or processed foods, then please, keep doing what you are doing, and don’t listen to those who suggest otherwise! You will be healthier and happier. Thanks for listening, my friends from far away.<br/>While it’s certainly possible that you are salt sensitive, when you decided to alter your diet, you changed many other things in addition to how much salt you ate. Two of the easiest ways to lower blood pressure without altering salt are 1. lose weight. 2. eat more veggies and fruits (aka foods rich in potassium). Numerous clinical and observational studies have shown that the sodium-potassium ratio is likely more important than how much sodium you eat. [Note that this only applies to the 99.999999% of humanity who eats between 3k and 6k mgs of sodium a day. Salt probably is a problem if you’re eating way out of the normal range, like 12,000mg + of sodium a day.]<br/>I was going to basically say the same thing. I had high blood pressure… I did a 30 day Paleo Challenge… All clean from the earth foods. I actually increased my salt intake by introducing a lot of salty beef jerky and pickled food into my diet for snacking. Not only did my blood pressure end up near perfect… I also lost 16 pounds. I wasn’t even someone you would really consider over weight to begin with… 178 lbs to 162 lbs in 30 days. My weird headaches were gone… the whole nine yards that come with high blood pressure. I’m convinced the salt and blood pressure are not related… and I think its a cop out to people who really need to get on an actual healthy diet.<br/>This article is dangerous and might convince someone to use all the salt they want. But all I have to do is eat a couple of big bags of Potato chips and I am getting 180/90 within a couple of days, stay off the salt then for 3-4 days and hydrate well, back to 130/70. Now “maybe” I am hypersensitive, but since this has repeated a half dozen times, I avoid salt. There is plenty in normal foods/<br/>Looks like you dont know what you are talking about… read Curt Nicol DD PhD entry below. and read again this article… you’ve been biased by exposure to the doctors who got biased by years and years of all the yada..yada..yada… read the article again. Of course, you are not going to start eating salt by the pound… everything would taste awful anyway.<br/>What is dangerous is advice and treatments with no scientific basis based on hypothesis alone, the collateral effect of reducing most peoples regular salt intakes is eating less processed food containing huge amounts of refined or simple carbs, highly oxidation prone oils, denatured substances, contaminants and additives.<br/>Reducing these will lead to improved overall nutrition.<br/>Limiting salt on its own with no other variables will show little to no effect in most people and can be detrimental to others.<br/>Me to. I’ve entered a detail comment of stop and start tests that 100% proved my hypothesis that Na was one of the large contributors to blood pressure. Takes an effort to document and record methods and result. Mine was as high as 205/115. I got it down to a consistent 100/65 for two years. My work is documented in this comment section but has yet to show up.<br/>A lot of people here saying that eating a bag of chips increases their blood pressure. Do they not realize it isn’t a health food? Do they think it possibly doesn’t contain all the wrong stuff?<br/>There has to be some other high sodium food they can use to show how salt affects their blood pressure.<br/>That’s right… what is bad is the oil and grease that is going the the pipes and constraining them… plus potato chips, it’s all starch, which turns to sugar, then fat …<br/>I would not be credulous enough to think for a minute, that salt is NOT related to high blood pressure, and increased body temperatures, for it certainly DOES. I reduced my 160 over 80 blood pressure down to 119 over 81 in a few weeks by cutting my salt intake severely. Why is it everytime I eat a several servings of potato chips, or eat Mc Donald’s french fries, I get immediately face flushed and feverish? I have even felt and heard, yes, the constricted veins in my own head, after having high blood pressure, dilate, expand, and break open again,after drinking cups, and cups of water, with the disappearance of the fever, disappearance of discomfort or congested head feeling, and reduced blood pressure.<br/>This really bothers me, and I have t confess to being somewhat confused now. I LOVE salt and can consume more in a single meal than you are supposed to consume in a day. It never seemed to affect my b.p.<br/>Then when my b.p. started increasing as I got older, my doc said to cut out salt. So I did…with no real effect. I was actually admitted into hospital with a serious infection, only to find that when I was discharged, I had been kept on a low sodium diet, even though on admission, my sodium level was dangerously low.<br/>This all made me believe that the dangers of sodium were only a myth, at least for me anyway. But then my wife got ill. Her b.p. was being constantly monitored as it kept going too low. They used to inject her with “sodium” (salty water I believe) and her blood pressure would come up almost immediately. This was intravenously however.<br/>So is it that I’m not salt-sensitive, or is it something about the stomach that acts a s barrier (so ingested salt does not affect you), while IV salt will?<br/>For something that is so fundamental in medical advice, it is so frustrating that there seems to be so little research, at least quality research done on it.<br/>Conversely, on a later admission to hospital, they had me on low sodium again (once and idiot puts it on your medical records, it seems impossible to get it off…) and gave me a blood pressure reducing medication. My b.p. dropped through the floor and was worrying them at one stage.<br/>BP medications are not evidenced to improve outcomes or be safe in most situations. Modern medicine is quite dangerous they kill people constantly with what they prescribe.<br/>Your wife may have kidney and adrenal problems while you more likely have vascular problems. Consider the possible environmental causes, you drink water with fluoride that increases absorption of lead, lack of antioxidants like ala, vit a/e/c/d/k2 can lead to increased oxidative stress arterial sclerosis and calcification of arteries restricting the ability of vessals to dialate, increased irritant exposure raises vasoconstriction and coagulation by increased seratonin release and lower amounts of nitric oxide produced by endothelial damage, low vitamin c leads to lessened collagen synthesis as does raised cortisol levels, both lead to poor circulation.<br/>These things can cause problems anywhere.<br/>I just spent an hour writing up a comment. My doctor wishes to see it. I doe not show up. What is going on? Did I waste my time? Please respond.<br/>Excellent article. Articles of this type bring out the health nutters and know-it-alls….just take a look at the comments. This also reminds me of the “global warming”….”climate change” (or whatever they are calling it this week) “experts” who preach it like it was gospel when they too have no definitive proof. | Fíoras nó miotas: Ardaíonn Sóidiam brú fola<br/>Bhuel, Matt, casadh sé amach ní fhéadfadh aiste bia sóidiam ard brú fola a ardú, ná aon éifeacht díobhálach a bheith aige ar shláinte cardashoithíoch ar chor ar bith. Ach beidh mé a chlúdach an teoiric ar cén fáth ardaíonn salann brú fola thíos - ach realize go bhfuil sé ach teoiric agus ceann amháin nach bhfuil tacaíocht suas le go leor de aon fhianaise eolaíoch crua (agus tá níos mó fianaise a deir nach bhfuil sé ná nach bhfuil).<br/>Tá an díospóireacht maidir le ithe an iomarca salann thart ó na 1960í. Cuimsíonn beagnach gach móreagraíocht sláinte an smaoineamh go bhfuil ithe an iomarca salainn ag déanamh dochair do do shláinte. Tá formhór na n-asraonta nuachta bunaithe ar na moltaí seo agus bíonn claonadh ag daoine iarracht a dhéanamh iad a leanúint.Is dóichí go n-itheann sé seo an fáth go n-itheann formhór dúinn, go háirithe daoine scothaosta le fadhbanna croí, go bhfuil a fhios againn an méid salainn a ithimid a laghdú. Ní mór dóibh siúd againn ar mhaith leo an smaoineamh go dtacaíonn fianaise láidir le haon mholadh, céim siar ar an gceann seo.Mar atá luaite, faoi láthair níl aon fhianaise láidir ann go n-ardóidh salann do bhrú fola go ainsealach.<br/>Mar sin, cén fáth gur bhrúigh an chuid is mó d’eagraíochtaí sláinte an smaoineamh ar aistí bia sóidiam íseal?Is é an teoiric atá taobh thiar dá bhfuíd ná fuaim, agus tá roinnt staidéir ann a léiríonn mion-riosca brú fola ardaithe le iontógáil salann an-ard. Ar an drochuair, tá go leor staidéir eile ann nach léiríonn aon mhéadú, agus fós d’fhéadfadh roinnt a léiríonn laghdú ar iontógáil salann do bhrú fola a ardú!<br/>Méadóidh an salann smaoineamh do bhrú fola le brú Osomotic. Is é Osmosis gluaiseacht tuaslagóir (sa chás seo uisce) ar fud na seicní leath-thréscaoilteacha (cosúil le ballaí cealla), ó réimsí tiúchan níos ísle réiteach (sa chás seo salann) go limistéir tiúchana níos airde de thuaslagtha. Is ionann é seo go nádúrtha agus tiúchan na tuaslagóirí ar dhá thaobh an ts membrane (is é an brú omotic freisin cén fáth gur féidir salann a úsáid chun feoil a chaomhnú.)<br/>Mar sin téann an teoiric go bhfuil nuair a ithimid an iomarca salann, tá ár sruth fola níos sóidiam ann ná na ceantair máguaird inár gcorp. Cruthaíonn an t-ardú in uisce laistigh de na hartairí agus na féitheacha méadú sa bhrú laistigh de na hartairí agus de na féitheacha sin. Feidhmíonn an salann féin mar ghreann laistigh de na hartairí is cúis leo srian a chur leo. Meastar go méadóidh sé seo do bhrú fola.<br/>Is cosúil go bhfuil an teoiric, ar an dromchla, an-fuaime.Tar éis an tsaoil, is féidir linn a dhéanamh ar an bpróiseas salann ag tarraingt uisce trí seicní tharlaíonn am agus am arís sa saotharlann. Is í an cheist, a tharlaíonn sé seo i ndáiríre laistigh dár gcomhlachtaí, agus a dhéanann sé seo faoi deara i ndáiríre Hipirtheannas fadtéarmach (brú fola ard)?<br/>Sa bhliain 1969, rinne Lewis Dahl tástáil ar “roghnaíocht George McGovern ar chothú agus ar riachtanais an duine”. Bhí imní air faoi thiúchaintí arda an sóidiam i mbia leanaí agus cheap sé go dtiocfadh méadú ar bhrú fola daoine fad. Ba é an réasúnaíocht atá aige ná gur léirigh staidéir a rinneadh ar francaigh méaduithe i mbrú fola na francaigh.<br/>Thosaigh an comhrá maidir le salann agus Hipirtheannas ag scaipeadh i measc eagraíochtaí sláinte.Thosaigh na hInstitiúidí Náisiúnta Sláinte, i 1972, ag tabhairt isteach "Ardchláir Oideachais Brú an Fola". Mar a bhfianaise, chuir siad in iúl go soiléir go raibh teagmhais ísle de bhrú fola ar líon na ndaoine a ithíonn sóidiam an-beag.Tháinig siad chomh maith leis an samhaltú francach. Thug eolaithe ag an am ceist air seo, mar bhí 60 uair á n-ithe ag na staidéir francaigh an méid a dhéanann an gnáthdhuine. Thug siad le fios freisin na daonraí a ithíonn aistí bia sóidiam íseal, méideanna ísle rudaí eile a ithe freisin, cosúil le siúcra (a théann i bhfeidhm freisin ar shosimóis).<br/>In ainneoin a gcuid agóidí, go poiblí, ba é an smaoineamh go raibh an brú fola ard anseo chun fanacht, agus tá sé fós inniu. Cuireann na Lárionaid um Rialú Galar, Na hInstitiúidí Náisiúnta Sláinte, Cumann Croí Mheiriceá, agus go leor eagraíochtaí eile aistí bia sóidiam íseal chun cinn faoi láthair.<br/>In ainneoin an tosaigh a bhí aontaithe de réir a chéile a chuir na heagraíochtaí idirdhealaitheacha seo i láthair, is mór an t-údar buaiteach é an chonspóid i measc eolaithe. Sa bhliain 1998, d’fhoilsigh an t-údar Tiúbanna dar teideal “An Eolaíocht Pholaitiúil” in Iris Eolaíochta. Dúirt sé, “Is é an chonspóid maidir leis na buntáistí, más ann dóibh, maidir le laghdú salainn anois ceann de na díospóidí is buaine agus is measa atá ag rith i ngach ceann de leigheas.”<br/>Ginearálta amháin Máinliaigh i dtuarascáil a scríobh, an luas a ghabh gníomhaireachtaí cónaidhme na Stát Aontaithe laghdú sóidiam, "a sheas i gcodarsnacht lom cé chomh fada a thóg sé le moltaí a thagann chun cinn ar an tábhacht a bhaineann le leibhéil colaistéaról fola a laghdú". Thug sé faoi deara freisin go raibh an difríocht níos suntasaí fós ag smaoineamh ar easpa taighde foilsithe a rinne tástáil ar an teoiric. Ar thaobh na smeach de, d’áitigh Sir Micheal Rawlings, cathaoirleach na hInstitiúide Náisiúnta um Shláinte agus Feabhais um Chliniciúil, a chuireann aistí bia laghdaithe salainn chun cinn, “Tá Treoir (le déanamh polasaithe) bunaithe ar an bhfianaise is fearr atá ar fáil. B’fhéidir nach mbeidh an fhianaise an-mhaith, áfach, agus is annamh a chomhlánaítear í.” Ní argóint an-láidir í chun iontógáil salainn a laghdú.<br/>Breathnaímid ar chúpla staidéar réasúnta le déanaí.In 2008, thosaigh taighdeoirí na hIodáile ag foilsiú na dtorthaí ó shraith trialacha cliniciúla, agus thuairiscigh gach ceann díobh sin, i measc na n-othar a raibh teip croí orthu, gur mhéadaigh laghdú ar thomhaltas salann an baol báis. Leanadh leis na staidéir seo ag daoine eile a léirigh i measc diaibéiteas Type 1 agus 2, na hEorpaigh sláintiúla agus othair a bhfuil teip chroí ainsealacha acu, ba dóichí go mbeadh galar croí orthu siúd a ithonn i lár an ghnáthraoin.<br/>In 2011, ní raibh aon fhianaise ag dhá léirmheas Conchraen go bhfuil sláinte daoine níos fearr nó níos measa ag aistí bia salainn ísle. Dúirt siad, "Tar éis níos mó ná 150 staidéar cliniciúla randamach agus 13 daonra gan comhartha soiléir i bhfabhar laghdú sóidiam, d'fhéadfadh seasamh eile a bheith ann glacadh leis nach bhfuil comhartha den sórt sin ann."<br/>Fiú amháin i bhfianaise aon fhianaise eolaíoch soiléir chun tacú leis agus lena mhalairt, in 2010 lean na Lárionaid um Rialú agus Cosc ar Ghalair, an Institiúid Leigheas, agus Cumann Mheiriceá Hypertension ag cur aistí bia sóidiam íseal chun cinn mar bhealach chun brú fola ard a rialú.<br/>Sa deireadh, a bheith ina ghairmí leighis agus duine éigin a bhfuil gá fianaise shoiléir chun cinneadh a dhéanamh faoi cibé an bhfuil mé a fháil a chur le suimeanna copious de salann ar mo fries, tá áthas orm a fháil go dtí seo tá an-beag! Is cosúil go gcuireann na móreagraíochtaí sláinte go léir aistí bia íseal sóidiam chun cinn, ach níl aon staidéir chomhsheasmhacha foilsithe ag aon cheann acu a léiríonn cabhair aiste bia íseal sóidiam sa tsláinte, go háirithe i sláinte cardashoithíoch. Is é an rud is annoying, peve mone peataí, ná go n-insíonn aon cheann de na heagraíochtaí seo do dhaoine go bhfuil an eolaíocht taobh thiar dá mbeartais conspóideach agus go bhféadfadh siad a bheith cothrom mícheart. Dúirt Ronald Bayer, David Merriott Johns, agus Sandra Galea gur fearr ina n-alt “Salann Agus Sláinte Poiblí” - “Tar éis breithniú cúramach a dhéanamh ar an díospóireacht maidir le salann, ní mór dúinn a thabhairt chun críche nach botún é deireadh na heolaíochta ná an dea-bheartais.”<br/>Mar sin, ba chóir duit dul amach agus smother gach rud salann anois? Mar is amhlaidh le mórchuid na rudaí, mura raibh an eolaíocht in ann an cheist a fhreagairt go cinntitheach ar bhealach amháin nó ar an taobh eile, agus ba mhaith leat a bheith sábháilte seachas brón, téigh díreach leis an riail d'aois de “ measarthacht i ngach rud”. Más maith leat mé, cosúil le gach rud cosúil le imeall gloine margarita agus modhnóireacht a mhilleadh, ar a laghad anois is féidir go mbraitheann tú beagán níos fearr faoi mar is cosúil go bhfuil an eolaíocht ag caitheamh níos mó agus níos mó i dtreo aistí bia sóidiam gan ghá agus daoine arda nach bhfuil díobhálach ar chor ar bith.<br/>Más maith leat an t-alt seo agus na Fíricí Bónas thíos, b'fhéidir gur mhaith leat freisin:<br/>- Cén fáth go bhfeabhsaíonn Salt blas<br/>- Cad a Dhéanann na huimhreacha i Tástáil Brú Fola agus Cad a Dhéanann siad Insíonn an Dochtúir<br/>- Cad is cúis le hAirm, Cosa agus na Cosa ar “Tabhaile ina chodladh”<br/>- Barr 5 Seifteanna Garchabhrach Ba chóir do gach duine A fhios<br/>- Conas a bhaint Satin cairpéad Úr le rud ar bith ach salann<br/>- Ní galar ná tinneas ann féin é an brú fola ard.Níl ann ach fachtóir riosca le haghaidh fadhbanna eile.Mar shampla, má tá brú fola ard ainsealach agat, téann do riosca ionsaí croí nó stróc suas go suntasach.

Má bhí tú ag fuiliú agus ag iarraidh stop a chur leis an gcaillteanas fola le brú díreach, agus ba chóir duit, ní bheadh ort ach thart ar 3 psi a úsáid chun stop a chur leis.Mura bhfuil siad i ndáiríre brú fola ard, ansin b'fhéidir 4 psi.Agus tú ag sábháil an lá arís!<br/>- Rinne Stephen Halles an chéad turgnamh ar a dtugtar chun brú cruinn na fola a thomhas ar an 1 Nollaig, 1733. Ceangailte feadán léi ar chlé tar éis an tsaoil tuaithe, ansin lig sí a fuil le Rush tríd an bhfeadán agus d’ardaigh sé ar airde 8’3’. Thug sé faoi deara “nuair a bhí sé ar a airde iomlán, go n-ardóidh sé agus go dtiteann sé ag 2, 3, nó 4 orlach”. Sea, dhún an capall amach, ach ní dóigh go raibh an tUasal Hales ródhian, rinne sé an turgnamh ar chapall a bhí le cur síos ar aon nós!

Ag aois 52-54, bhí sé seo os cionn tréimhse dhá bhliain (2005 agus 2006). Úsáidtear clár bogearraí (Die Power 4 – d’íoc mé $ 50 as ach tá sé saor in aisce anois) chun bia, sóidiam, agus am a fheidhmiú rothair a rianú. Ní raibh aon fhorálacha ag grafaí a tháirgtear ag baint úsáide as an bpeann agus an modh páipéir cé go ndéanfaidh siad an rud céanna ar an gclár chun sonraí a chur isteach ar bhrú fola. Níl luach ar bith ar dhochtúir atá ag glacadh léitheoireachta gach trí nó sé mhí i mo thuairim mura ndéantar iarracht an léitheoireacht a ghlacadh in imthosca comhionanna seachas treocht ghinearálta a thaispeáint thar roinnt blianta.<br/>Chinn mé go raibh sé sin le bheith ar aon luach, do mo chineál graf agus hipitéis (atá cruthaithe anois), bhí sé riachtanach roinnt léamha a ghlacadh thar thréimhse cúig nóiméad ar a laghad nó go dtí dhá dúnta (trí cinn nó níos lú scaipeadh uimhriúla agus níos mó ná trí bpm ar ráta chroí) léamha. Ba mhaith liom nóta a thabhairt faoi léamha tar éis dhá shiúlóid míle nó uair an chloig de rothaíocht ar ráta mall go measartha.Sceanglaíonn leathan os cionn cúig nóiméad tar éis dom dul i gcruth fisiciúil agus d'fhan mé ar an aiste bia. Molann suíomhanna gairmiúla ina suí síos 3 nóiméad nó níos mó agus níos mó ná léamh amháin a ghlacadh ach ní raibh ach dochtúir amháin nó dhá dhochtúir agam le fiche bliain anuas agus é sin á dhéanamh, cuid acu thar an ngá atá ann othar eile a fheiceáil go tapa. D'éiligh altra an chúis shuntasach le léamha brú fola a thógáil ab iad na cuideachtaí árachais a bhí ina gcoinne. D'éiligh sí nár fhéach roinnt dochtúirí ar na léamha mar sin cé a bhí i gceist má rinneadh iarracht chun léamh cruinn a fháil.<br/>Siúil i ndiaidh rushing a thaispeáint ar an am, staighre dreapadóireachta nó cibé rud, suí síos, tá altra grab do lámh agus a thógann do bhrú fola.Ag aon am amháin cinnte mé an dochtúir a ghlacadh léamh dara tar éis deich nóiméad a phlé le mo chuid fadhbanna leighis. D'éiligh sé go raibh sé annamh, fear le 15 bliain de thaithí cé go mhol suíomhanna gairmiúla fanacht trí nóiméad. D'éiligh dochtúir eile nár chuala sé riamh faoi bhrú fola a bhí i bhfeidhm aige (b' dhochtúir airm é le caighdeáin éagsúla oideachais a d'éiligh sé).<br/>Anois leis na torthaí. Bhí na graif álainn agus léirigh comhrialtas foirfe idir na cúig fhachtóir isteach; cineál bia, méideanna sóidiam, cleachtadh, ráta croí, meáchan.<br/>Bhí mé ar leigheas brú fola ar feadh deich mbliana gan ach athrú uimhriúil 5. Bhí mé i bhfostaíocht thánaisteach agus a fuair cleachtadh nialasach freisin.Ba é mo mheáchan ag deireadh uachtarach an ghnáthmheáchain nó beagán róthrom. Ba mhaith liom a ithe méideanna tipiciúil de sóidiam le haghaidh Meiriceánaigh (20+ mg) thar dhá lá.Agus méadaíonn méideanna éagsúla sóidiam íseal ar feadh 4 lá de réir a chéile thar thréimhse de roinnt laethanta. Tar éis 72+ uair an chloig de aiste bia sóidiam íseal agus clár aclaíochta, thit mo bhrú fola go suntasach. 135/90 go 110/70 thar thrí lá a bhí tipiciúil tar éis a bheith ar mo phlean aiste bia (an aiste bia DASH) ar feadh míosa. Rinneadh leibhéil siúcra agus bianna ardcheimiceacha a thaifeadadh freisin mar chuid den aiste bia. Léirigh iontógáil sóidiam níos mó ná mar a bhíodh ag feidhmiú mar an athróg is mó. Léirigh bianna ceimiceacha difríocht freisin cé gur minic go mbíonn leibhéil arda sóidiam ag bianna ceimiceacha.<br/>Thar cheithre lá tar éis aiste bia DASH a atosú bheadh athrú suntasach agus de réir a chéile ar an taobh thuas. Tógann sé dhá lá nó níos mó, ag brath ar ghníomhaíocht fhisiciúil agus ar thomhaltas uisce chun an sóidiam a scaipeadh i d’fhuil is é mo hipitéis cé nár dhearbhaigh mé é seo ó thaighde riamh.<br/>Tá amhras orm go n-athraíonn leibhéil sóidiam le haghaidh brú fola ceart idir daoine agus dearaí coirp éagsúla (inscne, cine, gníomhaíocht, saill vs skinny, leibhéal aclaíochta, srl). D'fhéadfadh go leor daoine a bheith beag más rud é go bhfuil aon éifeacht aige ó 2,000 mg vs 600 mg de Na. Níl mé ar cheann acu sin. Meastar go raibh aiste bia de 400 go 600mg de Na. Bhí an rud maith go leor le haghaidh uaimh (a raibh saol gairid aige ar chúiseanna eile) maith go leor domsa.<br/>Bhí orm iarracht a dhéanamh fanacht ag 600 mg mar gheall ar mo aiste bia. Bhí an aiste bia 200 go 400 mg mura raibh mé i bhfeidhm mé féin chun an croiteoir salann sin a úsáid).Is cuid riachtanach de do aiste bia é Sóidiam. Fuair mé méideanna os cionn 1000 mg i bhfad ró do mo chorp. Tá Hipirtheannas agus palpitations croí agam le ganntanas anála.Tháinig mo léamha saotharlainne thyroid foirfe agus thóg an dochtúir mé as cógais thyroid agus cógais brú fola. Gach oíche a chaith mo chuid fadhbanna go suntasach nuair a d'éirigh mé as mo phlean aiste bia / aclaíocht le blianta beaga anuas, scoirfidh mé go léir ag 3 go 5 a. Ar ús dochtúir amháin níos sine a bhí sa ghairm ar feadh daichead bliain d’éiligh mé nach raibh mé ach duine amháin de bheirt a chuaigh ó leibhéal TSH 0. go 4.0 (an raon uachtarach de ghnáth) tar éis an cógas a scor. D'éirigh le fadhbanna thyroid a thosú arís chomh maith le brú fola, pailniú croí agus croí.Thog mé an plean aiste bia agus rianú a fheidhmiú anois. Seolfaidh mé isteach nuashonrú tar éis trí mhí.<br/>Tá mé ach duine amháin, mar sin a chur 400 daoine ar an gclár céanna mé ar siúl agus a fheiceáil cad a tharlaíonn., Fadhb ar ndóigh é a aimsiú 200 daoine macánta as sin 400 nach bhfuil a FL ar an aiste bia agus a fheidhmiú bunachar sonraí nó buille faoi thuairim. Glacfaidh sé cumhacht freisin cloí le clár.Déanaim é a ghreamú le deich mbliana anuas ar chúiseanna ilghnéitheacha.Bain na cinn ón mbunachar sonraí nach dtaispeánann aon fheabhsú a dhiúltaíonn mionn a thabhairt faoi mhionn agus a ghlacann tástáil braite bréag!<br/>Ardaigh (Sóidiam) DOEanna do bhrú fola. Chuaigh mé chuig an dochtúir agus ba é 130/90.D'inis sí dom mo shalann a rialú (teorainn sóidiam 1500mg) agus sheiceáil mé suas dhá lá ina dhiaidh sin le mo bhrú fola 108/87. Am ar bith a itheann mé go leor bianna salainn, faigheann mé spíc i mo bhrú. Táim cinnte go bhfuil mé íogair ó thaobh salainn.<br/>Caithfidh tú a bheith cúramach (go maith leis) agus do aiste bia a choigeartú chun iontógáil sóidiam a theorannú agus féachaint ar chomharthaí d’ardú brú.Go háirithe nuair a a athraíonn do chorp.<br/>Má tá tú leisciúil nó nach bhfuil sin gníomhach, tóg 30 nóiméad 5 lá sa tseachtain (150 nóiméad san iomlán) ar a laghad chun cleachtadh réasúnta a fháil.<br/>Sílim gurb é an pointe go bhfuil sé sin ag moladh aiste bia sóidiam níos ísle, a d’fhéadfadh tionchar a imirt ar shraith ar leith de dhaoine, iad siúd a bhfuil Hipirtheannas cheana féin agus atá íogair ó thaobh salainn, go bhfuil daonra ar fad ridiculous. Is é pointe eile an dtagann fadhbanna cardashoithíoch ainsealacha i ngeall ar iontógáil salann ard-nósanna a thabhairt don phobal ach níl aon taighde aige chun tacú leis. Tuigim níos mó sóidiam ná mar molann an CDC agus ní raibh mo BP níos airde ná 117/70, mo airde riamh, gnáth thart ar 100-110/65-70.<br/>B’fhéidir go bhfuil potaisiam cheallacha íseal agat, copar ard, íseal vitimín k2, maignéisiam íseal, vitimín E íseal, tocsaineacht miotail chomh maith le luaidhe, tá gach duine nochtaithe do luaidhe agus fluairíd, na rudaí seo cumaisc a chéile.<br/>Féach ar na coinníollacha is cúis leat a bhfuil an íogaireacht salann, mar shampla cortól ard potaisiam íseal.<br/>Ná bí díreach ar salann mar is dócha go mbeidh ceisteanna iomadúla agat chomh maith le beagnach aon duine a itheann salann leis féin.<br/>De ghnáth faightear salann i siúcra simplí ard aon bhianna snáithíní le breiseáin.<br/>Tuigtear go bhfuil treoirlínte don daonra ar fad, ní hamháin ar do shon, is fadhb é seo toisc nach dtaispeántar go bhfuil salann gan scagadh míshláintiúil d’fhormhór na ndaoine agus go bhfeabhsaíonn sé sláinte agus go gcuireann sé leis na treoirlínte seo a dhéanamh gan aon aitheantas a thabhairt do indibhidiúlacht bhithcheimiceach.<br/>Ní hé an tuiscint a fháil ar ísliú HBP go léir agus go bhfuil sé seo déanta go meicniúil ag drugaí i staidéir nach léiríonn aon fheabhsú i dtorthaí agus fiú comharthaí níos measa lasmuigh de chomhartha BP.<br/>Rudaí le breithniú, sliocht duille Olive, vitimín c2, potaisiam, curmin, stevia (an mhilsitheoir nádúrtha), maignéisiam, pomegranite, l-arginine, natkinase, ola éisc, cócó, biatais, aigéad lipoic alfa, bromelain, síol lín, soilire, coq10, síol lín, haworne. Tá na fadhbanna seo go léir a fheabhsú BP agus cardashoithíoch.Tá go leor níos mó i do uirlisí ná mar a cheapann tú<br/>Maidir le siúcra, ba cheart do mhná a siúcra a theorannú (Is é an t-ábhar agus an faire amach do alcóil siúcra áirithe) 20g-30g snack agus 30g-45g gach béile a choinneáil, ba chóir d'fhir a gcuid sneaiceanna a choinneáil mar mhná 20g-30g a snack agus 60g – 75g béile. Is iad na huimhreacha is ísle an teorainn do diaibéiteas ar ndóigh.<br/>Creidim go bhfuil íogaireacht le sóidiam ag roinnt daoine.Tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh mé. tar éis a bheith ar 3 meds éagsúla BP ag aon am amháin agus fós tar éis Hipirtheannas neamhrialaithe, thosaigh mé ag léamh lipéid bia agus ag laghdú go suntasach mo iontógáil sóidiam. Tá an chuid is mó de na bianna próiseáilte luchtaithe le sóidiam.Bhí mé in ann 2 mhodh a stopadh go hiomlán agus an tríú ceann a laghdú go 1/4 den dáileog forordaithe.Maidir liom, tá difríocht mhór déanta ag sóidiam a laghdú. An oíche seo caite thóg mé 10 mg de linópril, arb é 1/4 den dáileog laethúil forordaithe é.Sa lá atá inniu tá mo BP ró-íseal, 105/48.Tá mé i ndáiríre chun monatóireacht a dhéanamh air go comhsheasmhach, toisc nach bhfuil BP íseal i bhfad spraoi, ach an oiread.<br/>Tá drugaí brú fola neamhéifeachtach, ní theipeann orthu torthaí a fheabhsú ach an léamh BP.<br/>Tá tú tar éis a laghdú do iontógáil de salann potaisiam ard siúcra bianna junk snáithín íseal, bhí sé seo i gcónaí ag dul a ísliú do bhrú fola.<br/>Ní hé Salann an namhaid a theastaíonn uait ach potaisiam agus frithocsaídeoirí chun é a chothromú agus strus níos ísle.<br/>Nuair a laghdaíonn daoine sóidiam sa chaoi seo is féidir leat cur leis chun é féin a salann, tá tú a athrú go hiomlán do iontógáil aiste bia go leor rudaí, is é seo an chaoi is féidir daoine a fooled i smaoineamh ar a rud amháin.<br/>Déantar an dáileadh seo ar chúis uatha fadhbanna i gcónaí i hipitéis agus is gnách go mbíonn siad a bheith bréagach go hiomlán nochtann rudaí uatha mar CO2, salann, saill sháithithe, colaistéaról, easpa seratonin, fiú easpa úsáid na n-uiscí nimhe.<br/>Is miotais iad seo go léir a dteipeann orthu faoi ghrinnscrúdú ach a bheith ina seasamh i gcónaí mar chúis le rialú a dhéanamh ar chomhlachtaí trí bhrú a chur isteach agus ar choimhlintí sáraitheacha a bhriseadh as a riocht.

Bhí mé ag léamh leabhair sláinte ar feadh na mblianta... CADÁIDEACHAS... agus léigh mé isteach iad an méid atá clóite san alt seo.Tá nasc cruthaithe ag NÍL idir salann agus brú fola ard. Ina theannta sin, i gceann de leabhair a léirigh sé go bhfuil salann a úsáidtear chun aigéad boilg, agus tá sé ironic go bhfuil an aiste bia sóidiam íseal mar thoradh go minic ar fhadhbanna díleá.<br/>Na dochtúirí a chreideann a thógann 3 chreidmheas ar chothú sa choláiste agus sna comhdhúile páirce a mbíonn fo-iarsmaí níos measa acu ná an galar iarbhír.<br/>Is é dochtúir, a deir gurb é Chiropractic “ní fíor-leigheas.” Léigh na páipéir Windsor.

(Níl mé ina chirapator).<br/>Téigh ag léamh leabhair le Norman Walker, (go háirithe “torthaí agus Glasraí Úr”), TC Fry, agus Herbert M. Shelton (Snáithiú Mór, is féidir le Fasting shábháil ar do shaol). Tá siad ar fad léite agam.<br/>LÍNE Is alt den scoth é seo agus tá iontas orm go bhfeicfidh tú an fhírinne a cuireadh go hoscailte in alt mar seo... ach creideann tú cad is mian leat agus glacann tú ceimiceáin a bhrú ag an ngairm leighis... ag ithe na rudaí a theastaíonn uait, ná ag cleachtadh agus nuair a théann rudaí mícheart ach pill....<br/>Rinne mé iarracht na “Pháipéir Winsdor” seo a chuardach agus níl a fhios ag Google fiú cad atá á labhairt agat.

Mine, is maith liom 🙂<br/>Tá an t-alt seo míthreorach.Toisc gur “teoirne” é éifeacht dhiúltach salainn ar bhrú fola, ba cheart dúinn neamhaird a dhéanamh air.Go deimhin tá an chuid is mó de leigheas agus eolaíocht á chur i gcrích ar theoiricí sochreidte. Is é an fhírinne aiste bia salainn íseal níos lú ná aiste bia salann ard agus cosúil le gach rud go bhfuil an morálta fíor an scéil modhnóireacht.Chomh maith leis sin athraíonn an t-údar iad féin ag rá nach bhfuil aon fhianaise ann... Níl ann” chun tacú leis an teoiric seo, ach ansin dul ar aghaidh chun staidéar amháin ar a laghad a dhéanamh a thaispeánann an corónú diúltach i ndaoine agus i gcartaí eile a bhaineann leis. Tá an chuid is mó de na míochaine dubh draíochta agus admhóidh go leor dochtúirí é sin. Cinnte uaireanta tá muid i bhfad ó fhios againn ach sa chás seo tá go leor eolaíochta taobh thiar de na salainn atá i gceist le BP chun é a dhéanamh fiú a mheas. Cuimhnigh freisin gur rud cóir nua é tomhaltas an duine ard-cainníochtaí salann ar an scála éabhlóideach, mar sin tá sé go cothrom mínádúrtha.<br/>@Mike: “Níl fianaise ar bith ann... Sea none” Is dóigh liom go bhfuil “Gan aon fhianaise cháiliúil” Nó, ina ionad sin, “Níl aon fhianaise ann nach bhfuil lochtach.”<br/>“Gach rud i moderation” Yep, go díreach mar a bhfuil Scott mhaith ag rá, "Beidh Fiú uisce a mharú tú i dáileoga ard go leor." D’inis sé dom, fiú amháin scéal mná a ndearna sé iarracht caitheamh leis an rud seo - d’ól sí méideanna ollmhóra uisce agus chríochnaigh sí ag fáil bháis uaidh.<br/>Tá an chuid is mó de leigheas dubh draíochta agus beidh go leor dochtúirí a admháil go bhfuil.B'fhéidir céad bliain nó dhó ó shin.Ach tá méid iontach eolaíocht mhaith i gceist anseo na laethanta seo. Táimid i bhfad ó fhios agam gach rud, ach tá sé cinnte nach bhfuil draíocht dubh nó díreach buille faoi thuairim obair, mar a bheadh le tuiscint.<br/>Tá brón orm gan a bheith sásta leat Dave. Ach fiú ar fhoinsí na físeáin, is léir an t-ardú brú fola ar aistí bia ard-salt.Agus iad i ndeireadh ceann acu, agus tú ag caint faoi cuideachtaí boga agus sneaiceanna:<br/>Tá cuid de na cuideachtaí seo iontach i gceist le bheith ag iarraidh conspóidí saorga a chruthú maidir leis an ngaol idir iontógáil salann agus brú fola, 16,17 is dócha go bhfuil súil ag stopadh nó moilliú síos aon laghdú ar iontógáil salann daonra chun díolacháin ó dheochanna bhog a chosaint. "<br/>Fiú, ní speisialtóir mé sa cheantar, tá cur isteach ar easpa athbhreithnithe litríochta i bhfoinse faoin ábhar seo.<br/>aiste bia OH a phróiseáiltear bianna a bhfuil breiseán ard siúcra íseal iontu, tá staidéir breathnóireachta gan bhrí, tá na daoine seo ag ithe méideanna móra siúcra gach bliain. Má cheapann tú go bhfuil cead ag corparáidí a dháileoige a úsáid níos mó chun aon rud a dhéanamh gan féachaint ar eipidéim siondróm siúcra.<br/>Conas morónach a cheapann tú staidéar breathnóireachta ábhar do rud ar bith eile seachas hipitéis a mholadh, úsáideann tú idirghabháil agus staidéir placebo dúbailte gan aon athróg a chruthú dóibh cúis. Níl sé seo déanta chomh maith le haghaidh cholesterol nó saill sáithithe. Tá tú íospartach gullible na heolaíochta paiteolaíoch, nuair a deir sé nach bhfuil aon fhianaise nach bhfuil aon staidéar breathnóireachta a dhéanamh ar aon rud nach bhfuil siad ina turgnamh, nach bhfuil sé seo conas a oibríonn eolaíocht. B’fhéidir gurb é cochrane an grúpa is oiriúnaí don staidéar cliniciúil ar fud an domhain agus rinne siad athbhreithniú ar 150 triail agus 13 staidéar ar dhaonra.Anseo tá tú ag rá a gcuid torthaí mícheart bunaithe ar cad é? ní dhéanfaidh aon ní seachas do chreideamh bunaithe ar hipitéis gan aon fhianaise.<br/>Molaim duit an leabhar “Salta” a léamh, is cuntas stairiúil geopholaitiúil é den chuid is mó inár sibhialtacht, ach tá cuid mhaith eolaíochta aige freisin. Thógamar ár sibhialtacht ar salann.<br/>Deir an chéad mhír "ach realize go bhfuil sé ach teoiric agus ceann amháin nach bhfuil tacaíocht suas le cuid mhaith d'aon fhianaise eolaíoch crua," creidim go ós rud é seo suíomh gréasáin eolaíoch aigne nár chóir é a úsáid an focal teoiric sa chomhthéacs seo, ós rud é eolaíocht, tá teoiric míniú glactha de feiniméan, cruthaithe ag tástáil.<br/>Sea, ba chóir dó hipitéis a úsáid., Tá mé ag dul a bheith ag breathnú suas an stair na teoirice agus a fheiceáil má tá a fhios ag aon duine a chríochnaigh sé suas le dhá bhrí éagsúla den sórt sin.<br/>Maidir le gairmí míochaine (a dtagann glacadh le hardoideachas), tá tuiscint uafásach agat ar ghramadach agus ar litriú.<br/>Leanfaidh mé ag éisteacht le mo dhochtúireacht ar an ábhar seo agus teorainn a chur le mo iontógáil salann.<br/>@Mark: Rud éigin a gheobhaidh tú fíor faoi líon mór gairmithe leighis, is é an steiréitíopa a gcuid scríbhneoireachta láimhe ná go ginearálta ceart. (Tá Scott olc ar leith.) Agus uaireanta is féidir a gcuid scríbhneoireachta teicniúla a bheith thar a bheith uafásach, réamh-eagarthóir. (Déanann siad staidéar ar leigheas agus ar chorp an duine, ní scríobh siad, tar éis an tsaoil) Ach níor scríobhadh alt os cionn 100+, níor léiríodh go raibh sé riamh mícheart ar phríomhphointe (agus níor léiríodh ach cúpla cás go raibh sé mícheart ar mhionphointe). Gheobhaidh tú i gcónaí ar cheann amháin ar a laghad díobh seo i ngach ceann dá chuid alt, in ainneoin mo iarrachtaí macánta chun fáil réidh leo go léir. Ach sa deireadh, tá cúram orm faoi chruinneas i bhfad níos mó ná gramadach. Bheadh an bheirt acu go maith, ach bheadh sé an-deacair scríbhneoir a aimsiú de shaineolas agus cumas áirithe Scott chun smaoineamh ar mhéideanna móra na n-eolas leighis agus iad a phróiseáil.<br/>Ach i ndáiríre, ní bhíonn neart argóintí Scott bunaithe ar a eolas fairsing leighis. Go gcuidíonn sé sin go maith leis na staidéir éagsúla a dhéanamh ar an ábhar ina mbeadh an chuid is mó a bheith caillte sa téarmaíocht, gan a bheith in ann smaoineamh go criticiúil orthu agus a modheolaíocht.Is é neart an argóintí na staidéir féin. Sa cheann seo, ba mhaith leat a dhéanamh go maith a léamh i ndáiríre an dá athbhreithnithe Cochrane, agus b'fhéidir iad a chur ar aghaidh le do cardiologist as a chuid smaointe.<br/>Ná bíodh iontas ort má tá siad réidh, áfach, áfach, agus fiú má aontaíonn siad leo.Ní bhíonn na dochtúirí ag insint dá n-othar ag teacht suas leis an méid atá ar eolas acu i gcónaí nó má chreideann siad a bheith fíor. Go háirithe i gcásanna mar seo nuair a d’fhéadfadh dlíthe a bheith ina bhféidearthacht an-dáiríre má d’inis siad duit a ithe go léir an salann a bhí uait, ansin fuair tú bás ar shaincheist croí (ach gan aon rud a dhéanamh leis an salann), ansin déanann do theaghlach iad a agairt agus luann sé cad a deir gníomhaireachtaí rialtais éagsúla ar an ábhar, seachas an méid a cheapann an domhan leighis i ndáiríre. 🙂 Ní dócha go ghortóidh do sóidiam ach go gclúdaíonn sé backside na cardiologists. (bhí mé i ndáiríre plé suimiúil faoin oíche seo le Scott aréir faoi dhochtúir a bhí á phlé aige leis an té a dúirt rud éigin an-chosúil leis sin in ainneoin nach bhfuil a fhios aige nach bhfuil sóidiam ag dul a bheith díobhálach ar an mbealach seo, insíonn sé fós go leor dá chuid othar féachaint ar a n-iontógáil sóidiam.)<br/>Sa deireadh, mar a deir mé i gcónaí, "Ceist gach rud," ach freisin nuair a cheistiú, a dhéanamh ar an taighde a aimsiú na freagraí freisin, agus ansin a sheiceáil faoi dhó go díreach an taighde a dhéanamh cinnte. 🙂 Agus, b’fhéidir nach bhfuil an botún ann go mbeadh cumas gramadaí agus scríbhneoireachta ag teastáil le heolas ar ábhar nó ar fhaisnéis. D’oibrigh mé le tonna scríbhneoirí. Is féidir liom a rá, iriseoirí (agus daoine eile den sórt sin a bhfuil cúlra scríbhneoireachta acu) go hiontach ar scríobh... Tá siad beagnach go léir hard ag taighde, rud a chuir iontas orm ar na hiriseoirí, ach b’fhéidir go míníonn siad go leor faoi staid na meán tuairisciú ar staidéir eolaíocha.Is cosúil go bhfuil Greannmhar go leor, an meascán is fearr de chumas scríbhneoireachta agus taighde ina dlíodóirí. Tá siad fheiniméin ag an dá cheann i mo thaithí.Is gnách go mbíonn eolaithe, nó daoine a bhfuil cúlra eolaíochta acu, go dona i scríbhinn, ach go bhfuil siad dochreidte ag an taighde agus ag an smaointeoireacht chriticiúil. Ar ndóigh, níl sé sin ach ag dul le sampla-mhéid de cúpla dosaen scríbhneoirí a d'oibrigh mé leo, agus tá eisceacht amháin a fuair mé ann, ach is treocht atá tugtha faoi deara agam.<br/>I mo thuairimse, ní mór do gach duine a bheith difriúil. Chun mé salann ardaíonn mo bhrú fola go leor. seiceáil an bl pr 4-6x in aghaidh an lae. Fanann sé íseal go leor nuair a fhanann mé faoi 300 mg de salann. Chomh luath agus a ithe mé a lán de salann, cosúil le bia Sínis nó fiú fo feola agus cáis nó dhá slices de pizza mo bl prí dul go dtí 170/98., Tógann sé cúpla lá a fháil ar an salann amach as mo chorp. Ansin, beidh sé ag dul síos go dtí 130/80 agus uaireanta le beagán níos ísle.<br/>ar fáil duit ach suas rudaí ina bhfuil méideanna móra de carbaihiodráití simplí, chomh maith le cruithneacht.Tá siúcra oismality ard ach neamhaird mar gheall ar an meáchan a chuirtear i bhfeidhm ar salann<br/>Is féidir le deireadh a chur le cruithneacht aiste bia ina n-aonar p a ísliú 20-40 mmHG.

Athraíonn BP go forleathan fiú ó nóiméad go nóiméad.Tá feicthe agam go leor 160/100 titim go 130/75 le linn cúpla nóiméad. Chomh maith leis sin, tá trealamh tomhais BP an-athraitheach agus so-ghabhálach i éagsúlachtaí leathan ó rudaí cosúil le méid cuff agus athruithe úsáideora.<br/>Níl aon chonclúidí ó chúpla tomhas níos mó ná tuairimíochta agus smaointeoireacht bhuíoch.<br/>Ar dtús, ní alt dialann athbhreithnithe piaraí é seo. Aontaím, chuir an leagan ‘díreach ‘curch’ in iúl duit. Ach, déanaimis bogadh ar aghaidh, ceart go leor?<br/>Ní féidir liom a fháil go bhfuil an t-alt i beagán ar a laghad míthreorach., Is féidir liom a fháil go bhfuil an t-údar a dhéanann an pointe go bhfuil an chuma caillte ar go leor – "Mar a luadh, faoi láthair níl aon fhianaise soladach go mbeidh salann ardú ó bhonn do bhrú fola. Sea, aon. "<br/>Deir sé freisin go gceapann sé go criticiúil, mar sin, mura gcreideann tú é, a) lean ort le do chreideamh, nó b) a fháil amach duit féin.An bhfuil na hailt lego bhfuil pointe tosaigh agat anois.<br/>Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil an t-údar níos measa anois ná mar a bhí mé ag díriú ar an earráid ghramadaí ó am go chéile nó ar an díospóireacht "theory vs huch" gan ghá. Is é mo takeaway ná go gcuidíonn an t-alt seo dúshlán mo toimhde maidir leis an méid a shíl mé a bhí i gcrích cheana féin go heolaíoch. D'fhoghlaim mé rud éigin. Sin an pointe.<br/>@ Michael Steall Níl mé cinnte an raibh tú ag tagairt go sonrach do mo phost maidir le húsáid "theoirse", ach geallaim duit nach raibh mo thuairim i gceist a cháineadh ar chor ar bith. Ar a laghad, níl sé sna téarmaí céanna le “earráid” gramadaí nó litrithe.<br/>Ní bhaineann mo thuairim le “earráid” in áit gur moladh dúinn é sin a léamh agus a scríobh faoin eolaíocht a dhéanann ár gcuid chun úsáid an fhocail “teoir” a éileamh ar ais ón príomhshrutha nó ar a laghad, déanann muid iarracht.<br/>Tá iad siúd a trácht ar earráidí litrithe soiléire agus aontaím nach bhfuil siad tábhachtach i gcomhthéacs na faisnéise a chuirtear ar fáil san alt (cé go n-aontaíonn mé gur féidir leo a bheith ag tarraingt agus táim ag labhairt ó chainteoir Béarla neamhdhúchasach), ach amháin má tá a líon agus a gcarachtar den sórt sin go ndéanann siad an t-alt a thuiscint deacair nó dodhéanta fiú, ní bhfaighidh tú postáil dom mar gheall orthu.<br/>Is focal é an focal “teoiric” ar an láimh eile atá á úsáid go gníomhach ag faicsin áirithe den phlé eolaíochta / reiligiúin chun laghdú 200 bliain a dhéanamh ar dhul chun cinn eolaíochta agus tá sé á úsáid go gníomhach chun leanaí a chur amú san eolaíocht ina iomláine.<br/>Má d’fhéach tú ar an neacht – Díospóireacht Ham, d’iarr Gawker ar roinnt cruthaitheoirí ceist a scríobh chun lucht tacaíochta éabhlóide ar phíosa páipéir agus d’fhoilsigh siad na ceisteanna seo i bhfoirm pictiúir.<br/>Is sa spiorad sin a d’iarr mé ar choimeádaithe an láithreáin ghréasáin seo iarracht a dhéanamh an focal a úsáid ina bhrí eolaíoch. Más rud é nach bhfuil muid i réimsí na heolaíochta agus teicniúla é sin a dhéanamh, ní féidir linn a bheith ag súil leis na daoine sin atá ag iarraidh eolaíocht a shaobhadh chun é a dhéanamh ar a gcuid cuspóirí féin.<br/>Mar sin, le gach meas cuí, ní ghlacfaidh mé do chomhairle. Ligfidh mé cinnte earráidí litrithe a sleamhnú ach tá sé seo tábhachtach dom agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé tábhachtach dúinn go léir go bhfuil grá ag an eolaíocht.<br/>Ní hionann aon duine agus an eolaíocht, ní fianaise é cur isteach agus tuairimíocht bunaithe ar thoimhde.Níl go leor míbhuntáistí agus toimhdí ag baint le forbairt.<br/>Ní eolaíocht í an fhianaise a thaispeánann go bhfuil Macra éabhlóid láidir indéanta ag an bpointe seo faoi aon cheann de na teoiricí iomaíocha atá bunaithe ar shóchán agus ar roghnú nádúrtha amháin, toisc go gcaithfidh an cruthú a bheith fíor-eolaíocht. Ba mhaith liom a mholadh meicníocht eile a bheith le fáil.<br/>Ós rud é go seasann sé le fianaise salach ar fad neamhaird nó fiú éileamh mar fhianaise ar phróiseas níos casta ach fós cruthúnas ar éabhlóid nuair nach bhfuil sé rud den sórt sin i ngach cás.<br/>Tá fianaise againn faoi láthair go bhfuil sé ina bhfíric iomlán mar is micrea-éabhlóidiú go hiomlán ceart, áfach, i dtéarmaí macra-éabhlóid ba mhaith liom a mholadh eolaíocht a bheith bunaithe ar fhianaise nach bhfuil toimhde de go bhfíric agus skewing de na sonraí a d'oirfeadh sé ró-oiriúnach an teoiric.<br/>Ós rud é nach bhfuil éabhlóid mar go bhfuil sé ina creideamh i bhfad cosúil leis an teoiric Bang mór a bhfuil fianaise coimhlint ollmhór ann san am atá caite nuair a úsáidtear daoine fianaise a chruthú nó teoiricí a fheabhsú bheadh an teoiric seo seilfeanna, tá an teaglaim de na teoiricí seo cosúil le reiligiún, reiligiún na daonnachtaí tuata. Tá sé chomh polaitiúil agus a thagann siad ar na pobail a sheasann leis na creidimh seo liathróid dhubha agus ad homem nach féidir leo seasamh ar an bhfianaise ach ar imeaglacht. Taispeánann staidéir go bhfuil ad homenim chomh húsáideach le argóint réasúnaithe, úsáidtear é seo le heolaíocht dhlisteanach cosúil le aláram aeráide atá bunaithe ar CO2 agus Macraevolution nach bhfuil fianaise acu faoi láthair ar na cineálacha céanna bolscaireachta agus ionsaithe a thugann le tuiscint go bhfuil duine ar bith atá i gcoinne iad frith-eolaíochta nó monarón.<br/>Molaim léamh http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org<br/>Ní chreideann daoine nach n-aontaíonn leis an éabhlóid go huathoibríoch a chruthú, Cruthaíonn an éabhlóid i gcónaí ionsaithe agus distract as a n-arm lag féin a gcuid sútha talún ar cad a chreideann daoine eile agus glacadh leis bunaithe ar a gcuid toimhdí go minic go bhfuil siad tacaíocht le fianaise nuair nach bhfuil siad.<br/>Fíric amháin ba mhaith liom a chur leis:<br/>Is píosa fianaise eile iad na déirse agus na diuretics Téalainnis-mhaith sa chonspóid.Is spéis leis sin, ar a dtugtar diuretics ach nuair a thógtar an éifeacht seo go laethúil éiríonn beagnach nialas. Tar éis tréimhse teiripe ainsealach, is é an príomhbhuntáiste a sholáthraíonn na cógais seo ná go méadaíonn siad deireadh a chur le hiain sóidiam agus clóiríde ón fhuil trí mheán an tsiomallóra Na / Cl sa fheadán convoluted digiteach (mar aon le héifeachtaí eile cosúil le cailciam a choinneáil). In ainneoin go gcoinníonn laghdú a n-éifeachtaí brú fola fadtéarmach agus go bhfuil siad ar cheann de na cógais a úsáidtear den chéad uair chun brú fola a ísliú. De ghnáth cuirtear an éifeacht laghdaithe seo i leith deireadh a chur le sóidiam agus is cosúil go bhfuil sé ar aon dul leis an smaoineamh go méadaíonn leibhéil arda sóidiam brú fola.<br/>Creid é nó nach ea. Is cosúil go bhfuil Salann mo BP níos ísle. Má ith mé an iomarca sliseanna mé i ndáiríre a fháil meadhrán ó íseal BP. Ní féidir liom a rá liom é a fháil.<br/>Tá an “tealleolaíocht” seo dúr go simplí.Méadaíonn BAOanna brú fola am mór!Is rud, breathnaíodh, monatóireacht agus monatóireacht é. De réir a chéile ithe roinnt rudaí go leor salann lá amháin ná mar is gá seachtain de naturais chun fáil réidh leis an salann sin go léir ón gcomhlacht agus an brú fola a thabhairt ó 190-200 (!!yes, go bhfuil ard fuair sé!!!) ar ais go gnáth (120-130). Mar sin ná abair scéalta nach bhfuil fíor.<br/>Níl gach duine freagra mar an gcéanna do salann aiste bia.Is é mo mholadh dúinn a thabhairt faoi deara an leibhéal sóidiam inár dtorthaí saotharlainne gnáth i bhfisicíní bliantúla íosta.<br/>Ó óige, úsáidtear mé chun níos mó salainn a thógáil le mo bhéilí, ach ní raibh aghaidh agam ar fhadhb an High BP, in ionad uaireanta téann sé faoi bhun gnáth. Rinne mé an fhadhb seo a chur i gcrích & tháinig mé ar an gconclúid go dteastaíonn níos mó ná mar is gnách ó mo chorp chun an fhadhb ‘íseal BP’ a tharchur go géiniteach. Mar sin?Is é d’inchinn an teagascóir do do shláinte.<br/>Bhuel, níl mé ach cothaitheach (cosúil le mór chothú Ollscoil a céim i mí na Bealtaine) agus b'fhéidir cad a d'fhoghlaim mé go bhfuil tarbh, ach tar éis a bheith ag smaoineamh ar an pathophysiosology conas is féidir sóidiam tionchar a imirt ar brú fola, a aimsiú mé go bhfuil an moladh ciall, ach ba mhaith leat a dhéanamh níos mó ná díreach sóidiam a ghearradh. Rud amháin atá tábhachtach ná an sóidiam: cóimheas potaisiam (ie itheann tú a bunch de bianna ard-phróiseáilte, sóidiam breise i gcomparáid le torthaí úra nó reoite agus glasraí). Admhóidh mé nach bhfuil gach duine íogair ó thaobh salainn agus go bhfuil cinneadh comhfhiosach déanta againn, i réimse na sláinte, glacadh leis go bhfuil gach duine mar gheall ar thástáil maidir le salann-íogair (má tá focal ann sin!) costasach, fada agus praiticiúil. Ach tá an smaoineamh nach bhfuil aon fhianaise sochreidte maith ag nascadh salann agus Hipirtheannas bréagach.Seo ach 6 alt. Ní iad seo na cinn a thug ár n-Ollamhaí dom a léamh (cé gur mhaith leat iad a fháil ar do shon cinnte gur féidir liom), ach tá siad go maith ar cheann mar sin féin agus ní gá duit cód nó ballraíocht speisialta Ollscoile chun rochtain a fháil orthu. Ar aon chaoi, anseo a théann tú ar eagla go mbeadh tú ag iarraidh níos mó a léamh:<br/>An léiríonn aon cheann díobh siúd go bhfuil comhghaol gan fachtóirí eile? "a bheadh ort a dhéanamh níos mó ná sóidiam gearrtha"... an bhfuil fianaise ann nach bhfuil ag déanamh na gníomhartha eile sin gan sóidiam a ghearradh ag obair chomh maith le sóidiam a ghearradh freisin?<br/>Úsáideadh Cochrane 150 triail agus 13 staidéar ar dheis? Mar sin tá 6 agat, is é seo do “oideachas” ag an obair.Déanann an t-eolas seo cuardach claonta chun tacú leis an hipitéis lochtach a fuarthas gan a bheith ar ardchaighdeán cheana féin.<br/>Mura n-úsáideann Cochrane ní alt ardchaighdeáin é, dá mba rud é nach raibh an tacaíocht suntasach san alt ansin.Tá feidhm ag an sásra oismóilachta maidir le aistí bia ard siúcra fós ina leith.<br/>Foilsítear an fhadhb anseo staidéir ar chaighdeán íseal i gcónaí go bhfuil daoine níos mó ná cúis ón áit nach féidir leo a dhéanamh, b’fhéidir, ionas nach mbeidh na hathróga uile á rialú acu.<br/>Is é an rud céanna a dhéanamh ar an hipitéis lipid agus an hipitéis colaistéaról.<br/>Is miotais iad seo freisin, tá dlúthbhaint ag colaistéaról na sonraí go léir le galar croí beagán.<br/>Is 1.4% an-suntasach é seo de dheasca an tionchair ar an gcroí a bhfuil ionsaí croí orthu cheana féin mar gheall ar a n-éifeacht mar fhrithchócóideach. Arís eile tá eolaíocht junk paiteolaíoch á n-úsáid chun cóireálacha a bhrú gan meicníochtaí agus athróg a aithint. Beidh an chuid is mó daoine a dochar trí chosc a chur ar vitimín k coq10 agus colaistéaról sintéis trí stains fós dochtúirí tacaíocht ó saint cógaisíochta a chur chun cinn a thabhairt dóibh do gach duine.<br/>Níl aon mheicníocht ag saill sáithithe trínar féidir léi colaistéaról a ardú, gan aon staidéar a dhéanamh ar saill ola a chuirtear in ionad go hiomlán le haghaidh ola i ndathanna dúbailte rialuithe gach athróg agus an níos dlúithe a thagann siad chun é sin a dhéanamh is measa d'idirghabháil PUFA ag méadú gach cúis báis.<br/>Cosúil leis sin, tá na trialacha ar chaighdeán íseal nach mbeidh mórán ann chun dul ar aghaidh leis an hipitéis go bhfuil creideamh reiligiúnach ag comhlachtaí agus ag dochtúirí a bhfuil tacaíocht ó fhianaise. Mar thoradh ar an mífhaisnéis seo tá drochshláinte agus brabús cógaisíochta.<br/>Tá mé tar éis mé a torn idir a ithe níos mó salann nó nach bhfuil, mar gheall ar laghdaíonn ithe níos mó salann mo ráta croí agus BP agus a dhéanann mé codladh níos fearr; mo lámha agus na cosa a bhraitheann iomlán agus te. mo mhéadú ar mhéid allais mar mé rothar nó ag siúl. Ach ansin tar éis dó é a ghlacadh ar feadh seachtaine nó 2 ansin tabharfaidh mé faoi deara go n-éiríonn sé ard go seasta; rud a fhágann gur dóigh liom go ndearna mé mícheart trí ithe. Sula méadaítear mo iontógáil salainn mo mhéara tanaí.B'fhéidir tar éis do leibhéil sreabhach mothú gnáth gearrtha ar an salann go gnáthleibhéil. Mar sin táim díreach hipitéis go bhfuil daoine a bhfuil íogair salann méid sreabhach maith agus ba chóir féachaint ar iontógáil salann, is féidir le daoine eile a ghlacadh salann ach stop a chur nuair a bhraitheann sé lán úsáid a bhaint as go bunúsach a choimeád ar bun méid sreabhach.<br/>Bunaithe ar fhéinléiriú, sílim go bhfuil an méid sreabhach a chothabháil an-tábhachtach.Ag amanna, tuigim go mbraitheann mé uisce tart agus deoch agus go gcoinníonn sé ag teacht amach; é sin ag iarraidh roinnt iontógáil salainn. Go bunúsach, ní itheann mé bia stánaithe nó i bhfad bianna tapa, is é mo iontógáil salann an rud a chuirtear go purposely leis an gcócaireacht. Tar éis a fheidhmiú, (ag ithe ag an leabhar agus ag obair amach srl faoi deara fadhbanna freisin) Tugaim faoi deara nuair a sheasann mé suas ó shuíomh suí, is dóigh liom go bhfuil mé allais amach salann agus, ar ndóigh, ól mé a lán uisce le linn an chleachtaidh. Níl mé ag moladh ag ithe níos mó salainn.Is é an bealach a bhfuil an corp ag rá leat go bhfuil do salann scriosta nuair nach bhfuil tú ag mothú go hiomlán i do chosa agus do lámha. Sílim go bhfuil sé seo ceart go pointe áirithe, mar a oibríonn an comhlacht níos mó ar tiúchan na rudaí ná na méideanna iomlán. Ní teoiric chuimsitheach í mar tá rudaí eile ann a d’fhéadfadh líon fola a mhéadú, b’fhéidir go mbeadh an iomarca salainn agat cheana féin in fhuil etc. Maidir leis an taifead, tá mo sóidiam san fhuil i gcónaí in aice le deireadh íseal an raon agus mar sin ní chaithfidh mo err brú orm taobh amuigh den raon.<br/>OK cad é an chonclúid? An n-úsáideann mé an croiteoir salainn anois nó nach bhfuil? Tá ró-fhada agam.<br/>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an t-alt seo mífhreagrach sa salann sin go hiomlán ardú p orthu siúd a bhfuil íogaireacht salainn acu. Má ithím rud an-shlánach is féidir liom dul i ngéarchéim hipirtheannasach i gceann uair an chloig.<br/>Tá an cineál íogaireachta seo coitianta agus ní luafaidh sé é (toisc nach bhfuil sé oiriúnach leis na húdair teoirice?) atá contúirteach.<br/>@Jim porter: “toisc nach bhfuil sé sásta leis na húdair?” Níl an " teoiric an údair" ann. Is alt é seo a scríobh faoi staidéir eolaíocha ar an ábhar agus a rá cad a deir siad, mar sin ní gá duit a scagadh tríothu agus an béarlagair leighis ar fad; déanaimid é duit go bunúsach cad a scríobhaimid faoi staid reatha an eolais dhaonna ar an ábhar atá idir lámha. Má athraíonn sé ag pointe éigin, déanaimid an t-alt a nuashonrú. Sa chás seo, áfach, go háirithe tá an dá athbhreithniú Crón ina luí go leor: “Tar éis níos mó ná 150 staidéar cliniciúla randamach agus 13 gan comhartha soiléir i bhfabhar laghdú sóidiam, d’fhéadfadh seasamh eile a bheith ann glacadh leis nach bhfuil comhartha den sórt sin ann.” Tá eisceachtaí ann maidir le gach riail, agus is cuma go bhfuil tú ar cheann agus sin an-spéisiúil má tá agus má tá sé suimiúil an bhunchúis a fhoghlaim.Ach arís, féachaimid ar an méid a deir na staidéir eolaíochta agus déanfaimid iarracht é sin a léiriú sa mhéid a scríobhaimid. Go bunúsach scríobhaimid foirm de pháipéir suirbhé le haghaidh ‘sleachtadh éadrom’ ina mbíonn ábhair i gceist, seachas páipéir thaighde a scríobh.<br/>Is dócha go ndéanfaidh strus faoi salann tú a mharú i bhfad sula salann é féin. An bhfuil an rud a fhágann go bhfuil tú sásta agus is dócha go mbeidh tú i do chónaí níos faide ná a mhalairt; agus fiú mura bhfuil, ar a laghad, bainfidh tú taitneamh as an am atá agat.<br/>Creidim gurb í an fhadhb nuair a dhéantar an salann a mheascadh le brú fola ard.Mar shampla, labhair duine éigin faoina n-ardú agus briosc/sceallóga á n-ithe toisc go bhfuil saill sna sliseanna. Bheadh an rud céanna a rá fries na Fraince nó miasa sailleacha eile., Mar sin féin, dá mbeadh tú a sprinkle salann ar rud éigin cosúil le torthaí, ní bheadh sé a bheith ar an éifeacht chéanna agus ní ardú do bhrú fola.<br/>Sílim go bhfaigheann sóidiam droch-rap agus déanann daoine áirithe i ndáiríre ró-bheag. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil salann le torthaí nó sailéid o.k. ach is í an fhadhb an meascán salainn/saille agus má cheapann tú faoi, sin an áit a bhfaigheann daoine a sliseanna prátaí salainn isteach de ghnáth, fries na Fraince, feoil an-séasú, i miasa creamy, etc.<br/>Ní chuireann an duine a scríobh an t-alt seo aon luach leis an bplé faoi bhrú fola ard ach amháin chun daoine a spreagadh chun cloí lena gceann sa ghaineamh.<br/>Bhí mé ag wrestling le brú fola ard ar feadh thart ar 12 bliain ó tharla timpiste tromchúiseach dom a bheith neamhghníomhach go fisiciúil ar feadh thart ar bhliain tar éis na tionóisce.<br/>Is féidir brú fola ard a rialú le cógais agus gan daoine freagra éagsúil a thabhairt ar chóireálacha éagsúla agus tá leigheasanna nádúrtha ann maidir leis an gcoimpliú seo.<br/>Is féidir le brú fola ard a chur faoi deara strokes, hemmorages inchinne agus cur le diaibéiteas agus galar duáin.<br/>Tá an t-iarmhéid idir potaisiam agus sóidiam inár gcuid fola an-cháin agus ar an drochuair níl an chuid is mó de na dochtúirí leid faoi an éifeacht go bhfuil cothú agus hydration ceart ar an riocht seo.<br/>An chuid is mó de na dochtúirí Bhí mé chun oideas a thabhairt amach a d'fhéadfadh nó nach bhféadfadh obair a dhéanamh.<br/>Tá substaintí nádúrtha ann a chuir ar mo chumas brú fola a ísliú laistigh de chúpla lá ón ngnáth go dtí an chuid is mó de na dochtúirí agus d’fhéadfadh cógais (cosúil le Cozar agus Novasca) suas le mí a bheith ag obair.<br/>Fuair mé amach go raibh éifeachtaí suntasacha ag sú líomóide amháin le créamtha nó ola riachtanach a chuir le 16 unsa d’uisce mianraí.<br/>Bhí éifeacht an-suntasach ag ól é seo uair nó dhó in aghaidh an lae i mo chás; chuaigh mo bhrú fola ó 220/95 go 130/90 laistigh de 3 lá.<br/>Cuidíonn gairleog (dí-chomhdhéanta) le súnna torthaí agus glasraí chomh maith le hábhar salainn níos ísle agus cion ard potaisiam le cuidiú freisin. (V-8 salann íseal nó V-8 glas).<br/>Ní hionann é seo agus an cheimic; ní chiallaíonn sé sin go bhfreagróidh gach duine an rud céanna leis na cóireálacha seo ach go n-easaontóidh mé go láidir nuair a deir duine nach bhfuil aon éifeacht ag an salann sin ar bhrú fola.<br/>Is cosúil go bhfuil sé seo dom a bheith mífhreagrach agus cavalier, ach amháin ar ndóigh tú ag obair ar cheann de na monaróirí salann.<br/>Tá gá le salann agus tá iaidís an chuid is mó de shalainn boird iontu, agus is cothaitheach riachtanach é sin do dhaoine.<br/>Tá sé an-tábhachtach go leor uisce íon a ól freisin; rud nach gcuirtear isteach ar mo dhochtúirí a lua riamh.<br/>Cuireann sé seo ar chumas an chomhlachta chun fáil réidh leis an iomarca salainn agus cabhraíonn sé leis an gcomhlacht é féin a ghlanadh.<br/>Tá go leor substaintí nádúrtha agus roinnt bianna (cosúil le lotnaidí) a d’fhéadfadh cabhrú le brú fola níos ísle agus is féidir leat teacht ar go leor post ar an idirlíon mar gheall orthu.<br/>Tá poist ag Web Md agus The Mayo Clinic araon ar an ábhar agus muinín agam astu ifreann de al níos mó ná údar an phoist seo.<br/>Is cosúil go bhfuil sé seo dom a bheith ina fheidhmiú i chosaint an do-ghlactha.<br/>Cén cuspóir atá leis?<br/>Cé a bhí Hippocreates ar aon nós agus cad a bhí a fhios ag an ifreann?<br/>Tá brú fola an-íseal agam.Má sheasann mé suas ró-tapa, beidh mé in ann snámh ar mo aghaidh.D'inis mo dhochtúir dom an oiread salainn agus is mian liom a ithe, níl aon imní orm.<br/>In aon chás, tógfaidh mé an chomhairle seo go léir le pinch... tá a fhios agat cad.;-D<br/>I ithe a lán de salann (agus is féidir liom a *LOT *)., Cúpla bliain ó shin tar éis a bheith chothú suas le a insint i gcónaí cé chomh dona is atá sé, chinn mé é a chur ar an tástáil. Mar Ph.D. Tá a fhios agam conas tástáil a phleanáil go heolaíoch, agus thar roinnt míonna ag íoslaghdú an oiread athróg agus is féidir, rinne mé tástáil ar mo bhrú fola agus ag mo iontógáil salann rialta i gcoinne iontógáil salann íseal. Bhí na torthaí i bhfad mar a bhíothas ag súil leis, cé go bhféadfadh daoine áirithe / b’fhéidir a bheith beagán éadulaingtí do leibhéil measartha ard iontógáil salann, domsa ní raibh aon difríocht ann ar chor ar bith. D’fhill mé ar bhia a ithe ar an mbealach is maith liom é (salty), agus inis d’aon duine a thugann comhairle ina choinne seo nach bhfuil a fhios acu cad atá á labhairt acu faoi LOL<br/>Tá mé 27 bean. Thosaigh mé ag a bhfuil brú fola ard agus mé ag glacadh Accutane in aghaidh na bliana go leith ó shin (Méadaíonn Accutane tógáil colaistéaról). Cad a bhí mé dian, bhí mo pulse ag 120bpm, bhí mé meadhrán, mo lámha clampáilte suas i cruth claw neamhghnách agus tingled siad go dtí go raibh siad caillte mothú., shíl mé go raibh mé ag fáil bháis i ndáiríre. Dúradh liom go raibh sé ach ionsaí scaoll, ach níor thug mé aon saincheisteanna imní dáiríre orm riamh.Tugadh ocsaigin dom ar feadh uair an chloig ar fad nuair a thosaigh mé ag craving salann go tobann.I d’iarr mé ar mo chara a reáchtáil chun McDonalds agus roinnt fries salainn bhreise a fháil dom. Laistigh de nóiméad ithe go léir go salann, bhí mo bhrú fola ar ais go gnáth, fuair mo lámha a mothú ar ais, agus d'fhéadfainn siúl agus anáil de ghnáth arís.<br/>Faighim na rudaí a spreagann sé an chuid is mó dom go bhfuil easpa codlata, ní ag ithe rud ar bith an lá ar fad, arbhar, cruithneacht, agus salainn ceimiceacha mar MSG. Ach ní dhéanann salann farraige agus salann gnáth tábla é a dhéanamh níos measa, déanann siad é níos fearr! Leis sin, bhí mé i gcónaí tástáil fola torthaí a léiríonn leibhéil ard potaisiam., An bhféadfadh sé seo a bheith páirteach ar bhealach éigin? Mo Dr Just shrugs sé amach mar gheall ar mo ghrá do prátaí agus torthaí citris lol<br/>B’fhéidir go mbeadh potaisiam nó hipearkalemia ag teastáil uait a bheith ina chúis leis na heachtraí a chuireann tú síos orthu agus is féidir le Accutane a bheith ina chúis le hipearchailéime.<br/>Is léir go bhfuil baint ag potaisiam agus sóidiam mar do cealla a mhalartú i gcónaí leo siúd isteach agus amach as cealla a choimeád ar bun tiúchan ioncheallach níos airde de potaisiam.<br/>Corrtíosóil a ardaíonn le díothacht codlata, gan an próiseas seo de tiúchan potaisiam isteach sa chill a ithe agus a aisiompú, ach tá sé i gceist eisfhearadh potaisiam, glacadh ceallacha ionsú sóidiam agus coinneáil sóidiam sna duáin a mhéadú, d'fhéadfadh go mbeadh rud éigin ag dul mícheart leis an bpróiseas seo gan a bheith eisfhearadh. Is é an chúis gnáth cosc ar an gcóras rein-agingensin a rialaíonn brú fola.<br/>Díol nourishes adrenals ach b'fhéidir gur mhaith leat a fháil ar roinnt níos mó vitimín C atá dírithe ann chomh maith leis an fhaireog pituitary mar iad seo a rialú do cortol agus Vit c lowers coritol agus strus is dócha laghdú ar an déine na eipeasóid.<br/>Rudaí le breathnú isteach, maignéisiam, vitimín e, glandular adrenaline, leibhéil copar/sinc, duáin agus feidhm adrenal.<br/>Go raibh maith agat as na tuairimí cabhrach go léir ar an suíomh seo.Is féidir le duine na poist go léir atá scríofa go tuisceanach a fheiceáil ó dhaoine a bhfuil a mbrú fola ard laghdaithe acu trí chaillteanas a theorannú. Bhí mo bhrú fola in aghaidh na bliana ó shin ag rith ar an meán 180/120 nuair nach ndearnadh cógais leighis, agus nuair a bhí mé ar 3 cógais éagsúla, ar an meán 140/90. Tar éis dom a bheith uafásach, bíodh sé ó na héifeachtaí diúltacha ó na meideanna nó ó thinneas cinn ó brú fola ard, chinn mé a athrú ar mo aiste bia. Gan aon tinneas cinn, nó mothú cosúil le mo scornach a bhí swollen, nó a bhraitheann cosúil le mo cheann a bhí ró-te.... d'fhéadfainn dul ar aghaidh agus ar aghaidh. Rinne mé é seo le NÍL táirgí daor., A oiread agus is féidir lá atá inniu ann sna Stáit Aontaithe, bianna neamhphróiseáilte a ithe, agus gach salann breise a sheachaint. Tabhair faoi deara, tá gach salann “cur leis” a léirítear i gceart, tá salann riachtanach do shaol an duine go nádúrtha.Agus tá an salann go léir atá de dhíth orainn go nádúrtha, mar sin ní gá aon rud a chur leis. Ag éisteacht leis na saineolaithe ceaptha seo, N'fheadar conas a mhair aon duine 10,000 bliain ó shin mura raibh an t-ádh orthu bloc salainn a fháil chun lick gach lá! Léigh mé trácht amháin faoi dhuine a raibh torthaí maithe aige ó “sú líomóide amháin leis an zest nó ola riachtanach a chuir le 16 unsa d’uisce mianraí”. Ba mhaith liom dúshlán a thabhairt dó agus do dhaoine eile triail a bhaint as sú líomóide le huisce. Is féidir liom a fháil amach má ghlan mé féin le gloine amháin de líomóide-uisce uair sa tseachtain, bhí éifeacht iontach aige ar mo shláinte. D’fhéadfadh na comhábhair eile cabhrú leat, ach bheadh sé ina turgnamh suimiúil duit. Mar sin, is maith liom, go leor, tá mé íogair do salann.B'fhéidir gur féidir le roinnt daoine a ithe méid ollmhór salainn ar bhonn rialta gan aon iarmhairtí sláinte díobhálacha. Ní fíor sin dúinn, agus tá sé maslach nuair a chuirtear an cheist seo faoi “daoine” nó “eolaithe” i gcónaí, “Nuair a thagann sé chun do shláinte, muinín duit féin os cionn gach duine eile”. Má tá tú cinnte go mbraitheann tú tinn, agus go dtugann do dhochtúir nó do chógaiseoir le tuiscint go bhfuil sé ar fad i do cheann, muinín duit féin, ní orthu. Más maith leat mé, bíodh míle uair níos fearr nuair a chuireann tú teorainn le do thomhaltas salainn nó bianna próiseáilte, le do thoil, coinnigh ort ag déanamh an méid atá á dhéanamh agat, agus ná bí ag éisteacht leo siúd a thugann le fios a mhalairt! Go raibh maith agat as éisteacht, mo chairde ó i bhfad ar shiúl.<br/>Cé go bhfuil sé indéanta go bhfuil tú íogair ó thaobh salainn, nuair a shocraigh tú d’aiste bia a athrú, d’athraigh tú go leor rudaí eile chomh maith leis an méid salainn a ith tú.Tá dhá cheann de na bealaí is éasca chun brú fola a ísliú gan salann a athrú 1. meáchan a chailleadh 2. ithe níos mó glasraí agus torthaí (aka bianna saibhir i potaisiam). Léirítear go leor staidéir cliniciúla agus breathnóireachta go bhfuil an cóimheas sóidiam-postism níos tábhachtaí ná cé mhéad sóidiam a itheann tú. [Tabhair faoi deara nach mbaineann sé seo ach leis an 99.999% den chine daonna a itheann idir 3k agus 6k mg den sóidiam in aghaidh an lae.Is dócha gur fadhb í an salann má tá tú ag ithe ar bhealach amach as an raon gnáth, cosúil le 12,000mg + sóidiam in aghaidh an lae.]<br/>Bhí mé ag dul a rá go bunúsach an rud céanna. Bhí brú fola ard agam... Rinne mé dúshlán Palo 30 lá... Gach glan ó na bianna domhain. mhéadaigh mé mo iontógáil salann trí go leor magadh mairteola salainn a thabhairt isteach agus roghnaigh mé bia i mo aiste bia le haghaidh sneaiceanna. Ní amháin go raibh mo bhrú fola ag deireadh beagnach foirfe... chaill mé 16 punt freisin.Ní raibh mé fiú duine a mheas tú i ndáiríre ró-mheáchan chun tús a chur leis... 178 lb go 162 lb i 30 lá. Bhí na naoi slat ar fad a thagann le brú fola ard.Tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil baint ag an salann agus brú fola... agus sílim go bhfuil sé ina chóp amach do dhaoine a dteastaíonn uathu i ndáiríre aiste bia sláintiúil a fháil.<br/>Tá an t-alt seo contúirteach agus d’fhéadfadh sé a bheith ina luí ar dhuine an salann go léir is mian leo a úsáid. Ach níl le déanamh agam ach cúpla málaí móra de sceallóga Prátaí a ithe agus táim ag fáil 180/90 laistigh de chúpla lá, fan an salann ansin ar feadh 3-4 lá agus hiodráitiú go maith, ar ais go 130/70. Anois "b'fhéidir go bhfuil mé hypersensitive, ach ós rud é go bhfuil sé seo arís agus arís eile leath dosaen uair, seachnaíonn mé salann.Tá neart i ngnáth-bhias /<br/>Breathnaíonn cosúil nach bhfuil a fhios agat cad atá á caint agat... léigh an iontráil PhD Curt Nicol DD. agus léigh arís an t-alt seo... tá tú claonta ag nochtadh do na dochtúirí a fuair claonta ag blianta agus blianta den yada... léigh an t-alt arís. Ar ndóigh, nach bhfuil tú ag tosú ag ithe salann ag an punt... bheadh gach rud uafásach ar aon nós.<br/>Is é an rud atá contúirteach comhairle agus cóireálacha nach bhfuil aon bhonn eolaíoch bunaithe ar hipitéis amháin, tá an éifeacht comhthaobhachta a bhaineann le hiontógálacha salainn rialta a laghdú ag ithe níos lú bia ina bhfuil méideanna ollmhóra carbaihiodráití scagtha nó carbs simplí, substaintí dí-ocsaídithe, éillithe agus breiseáin.<br/>Beidh níos mó cothaithe foriomlán mar thoradh orthu seo a laghdú.<br/>Ní thaispeánfaidh salainn a theorannú leis féin gan aon athróg eile gan aon éifeacht i bhformhór na ndaoine agus is féidir leis a bheith díobhálach do dhaoine eile.<br/>Chuir mé isteach ar thrácht mion ar na tástálacha stad agus tosaithe a chruthaigh 100% de mo hipitéis go raibh Na duine de na rannpháirtithe móra maidir le brú fola.Tógann sé iarracht a dhoiciméadú agus a thaifeadadh modhanna agus toradh. Bhí Mine chomh hard le 205/115. Fuair mé síos go dtí 100/65 comhsheasmhach ar feadh dhá bhliain.Déantar mo chuid oibre a dhoiciméadú sa chuid tuairimí seo ach níl a thaispeáint fós.<br/>A lán daoine anseo a rá go méadaíonn ithe mála de sceallóga a mbrú fola. An dtuigeann siad nach bia sláinte é? An gceapann siad nach bhfuil an stuif mícheart go léir ann b’fhéidir?<br/>Caithfidh bia ard sóidiam eile a bheith ann ar féidir leo a úsáid chun a thaispeáint conas a théann salann i bhfeidhm ar a mbrú fola.<br/>Sin ceart... cad é an droch an ola agus an ramhar atá ag dul na píopaí agus srian orthu... chomh maith le sliseanna prátaí, tá sé ar fad stáirse, a casadh le siúcra, ansin saill...<br/>Ní bheadh mé fiosrach go leor chun smaoineamh ar feadh nóiméid, NACH bhfuil a salann a bhaineann le brú fola ard, agus teochtaí comhlacht méadaithe, mar gheall air cinnte DOSE. Laghdaíodh mé mo bhrú fola 160 níos mó ná 80 síos go dtí 119 breis agus 81 seachtain trí mo iontógáil salann a ghearradh go mór.Cén fáth go bhfuil sé gach uair a itheann mé roinnt freastalaithe sceallóga prátaí, nó go n-itheann mé fries french Mc Donald, faigheann mé aghaidh láithreach agus iasc? Bhraith mé fiú agus chuala mé, sea, na féithe srianta i mo cheann féin, tar éis brú fola ard, buille, leathnú, agus briseadh ar oscailt arís, tar éis cupáin óil, agus cupáin uisce, le cealú an fiabhras, míchompord nó mothú ceann casted, agus brú fola laghdaithe.<br/>Cuireann sé seo isteach orm i ndáiríre, agus d'admhaigh mé go bhfuil mearbhall orm anois.Tá mé ag salann LOVE agus is féidir a ithe níos mó i mbéile amháin ná mar atá tú ceaptha a ithe in aghaidh an lae.Ní cosúil go ndeachaigh sé i bhfeidhm ar mo b.p.<br/>Ansin, nuair a thosaigh mo b.p. ag méadú mar a fuair mé níos sine, dúirt mo doc a ghearradh amach salann. Mar sin rinne mé... gan aon éifeacht fíor. Cuireadh isteach in ospidéal mé le hionfhabhtú tromchúiseach, ach amháin chun a fháil amach go raibh mé coinnithe ar aiste bia sóidiam íseal, cé go raibh mo leibhéal sóidiam íseal go contúirteach.<br/>Chuir sé seo go léir orm nach raibh na contúirtí a bhaineann le sóidiam ach miotas, mar sin féin ar a laghad. Ach ansin fuair mo bhean chéile tinn. Bhí a b.p. á monatóireacht i gcónaí mar choinnigh sé ró-íseal. Úsáidtear iad chun "sóidiam" a instealladh (uisce salainn Creidim) agus d'éireodh a brú fola beagnach láithreach.<br/>Mar sin, an bhfuil sé nach bhfuil mé salann-íogair, nó go bhfuil sé rud éigin mar gheall ar an boilg a fheidhmíonn bac (mar sin ionghabháil nach bhfuil salann difear duit), cé go mbeidh IV salann?<br/>I gcás rud éigin atá chomh bunúsach le comhairle leighis, tá sé chomh frustrating gur cosúil go bhfuil taighde an oiread sin beag, ar a laghad taighde cáilíochta a rinneadh ar sé.<br/>Os a choinne sin, ar dhul isteach níos déanaí san ospidéal, bhí siad dom ar sóidiam íseal arís (aon uair amháin agus leathcheannas a chuireann sé ar do thaifid leighis, is cosúil go bhfuil sé dodhéanta é a bhaint...) agus thug sé cógas laghdaithe fola dom. Mo b.p. thit tríd an urlár agus bhí sé buartha iad ag céim amháin.<br/>Níl fianaise ar chógais BP chun torthaí a fheabhsú nó a bheith sábháilte i bhformhór na gcásanna.Tá leigheas nua-aimseartha contúirteach go leor a mharaíonn siad i gcónaí leis an méid a fhorordaíonn siad.<br/>D’fhéadfadh go mbeadh fadhbanna duáin agus adrenaline ag do bhean chéile agus is dóichí go mbeidh fadhbanna soithí agat. Smaoinigh ar na cúiseanna comhshaoil a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ann, dílann tú uisce le fluairíd a mhéadaíonn ionsú luaidhe, easpa frithocsaídeoirí cosúil le ala, le cuairt a thabhairt ar /e/d/k2, is féidir le scléaróis ealaíne strus ocsaídiúcháin a bheith mar thoradh air, agus soiléiriú ar na hartairí a chuireann srian ar chumas na n-árthaí chun dul i ngleic le scaoileadh seratonin níos mó agus méideanna níos ísle ocsaíd nítreach a tháirgtear le damáiste endotrialal, tá sintéis collagen laghdaithe mar thoradh ar leibhéil chora a ardaíodh, scaipeadh lag.<br/>Is féidir leis na rudaí seo fadhbanna a chruthú áit ar bith.<br/>Ní raibh mé ach uair an chloig ag scríobh nóta tráchta. Ní thaispeánann mo dhochtúir é. Cad atá ar siúl? An ndearna mé m’am a chur amú? Freagra<br/>Airteagal den scoth. Airteagail den chineál seo a thabhairt amach na líonta sláinte agus eolas-uile.... ach féachaint ar na tuairimí. Cuireann sé seo i gcuimhne dom freisin an “tealladh domhanda”... an t-athrú aeráide” (nó cibé rud a bhfuil siad ag glaoch air an tseachtain seo) “saineolaithe” a insíonn gur mhaith leo an t-athrú sin a dhéanamh nuair nach bhfuil aon chruthúnas cinntitheach acu freisin. |
