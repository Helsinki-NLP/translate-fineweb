| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Μπακόπα<br/><br/>19 Νοε 2015<br/>Δημοσιεύτηκε από Doxiderol<br/><br/>Το Bacopa είναι ένα πολυετές φυτό που ευδοκιμεί σε ελώδεις υποτροπικές και τροπικές περιοχές σε όλο τον κόσμο. Το ιδιαίτερα θεωρούμενο βότανο είναι ένα βασικό συστατικό στο Doxiderol, ένα συμπλήρωμα διατροφής που ενισχύει τη γνωστική λειτουργία. Η Bacopa επιλέχθηκε για την ικανότητά της να προστατεύει τον εγκέφαλο και να αυξάνει την ακετυλοχολίνη, έναν βιοχημικό αγγελιοφόρο που δίνει τη δυνατότητα στο νευρικό σύστημα να αναμεταδίδει πληροφορίες.<br/><br/>Οι αγιουρβεδικοί ιατροί περιέγραψαν για πρώτη φορά τις θεραπευτικές ιδιότητες του μπακόπα το 300 π.Χ. Οι γιατροί κατέγραψαν τις ικανότητες του μπακόπα για να ενισχύσουν τη νοημοσύνη και τη μνήμη. Σχεδόν 2.500 χρόνια αργότερα, ένα αυξανόμενο σώμα σύγχρονων ερευνών επιβεβαιώνει τα γνωστικά οφέλη της μπακόπα που καταγράφονται στο Αγιουρβεδικό κείμενο.<br/><br/>Το 1987, ερευνητές στην Ινδία αξιολόγησαν τις επιδράσεις του μπακόπα στην πνευματική λειτουργία των παιδιών σχολικής ηλικίας. Κατά τη διάρκεια της μελέτης διάρκειας τεσσάρων εβδομάδων, χορήγησαν μπακόπα σε 40 παιδιά που ήταν 6 έως 8 ετών. Οι επιστήμονες καθόρισαν ότι η μπακόπα αύξησε την αντίληψη και τη μνήμη. Πολλοί γονείς στην Ινδία χρησιμοποιούν συνήθως bacopa για να ενισχύσουν την πνευματική ανάπτυξη των παιδιών τους.<br/><br/>Μια μελέτη 12 εβδομάδων που δημοσιεύθηκε στο τεύχος του Αυγούστου 2001 της Ψυχοφαρμακολογίας διερεύνησε τις επιδράσεις του μπακόπα στη γνωστική λειτουργία. Οι επιστήμονες ανέθεσαν τυχαία στους υγιείς εθελοντές, ηλικίας 18 έως 65 ετών, να λάβουν μπακόπα ή μια ανενεργή ουσία. Χρησιμοποίησαν επίσης μια διπλή-τυφλή διαμόρφωση για τη μελέτη για να αποκρύψουν τις ταυτότητες των προϊόντων.Οι ερευνητές χρησιμοποιούν αυτό το σχέδιο για να εξασφαλίσουν ότι τα αποτελέσματα των δοκιμών είναι έγκυρα επειδή εξαλείφει την προκατάληψη από τους ερευνητές και τους συμμετέχοντες. Η ομάδα bacopa γνώρισε σημαντική βελτίωση στην ταχύτητα με την οποία ήταν σε θέση να επεξεργαστεί την οπτική πληροφορία. Οι συμμετέχοντες έμαθαν επίσης πιο γρήγορα και αποθήκευαν νέες αναμνήσεις πιο αποτελεσματικά.<br/><br/>Το 2007, μια εργαστηριακή μελέτη του Texas A&M College of Medicine αποκάλυψε έναν από τους μηχανισμούς που είναι υπεύθυνοι για την ικανότητα του μπακόπα να προάγει την υγεία του εγκεφάλου. Σύμφωνα με τους επιστήμονες, η μπακόπα χρησιμοποιεί πολυφαινόλες για την πρόληψη του οξειδωτικού στρες και της βλάβης που προκαλεί στα υγιή εγκεφαλικά κύτταρα. Το Bacopa μειώνει επίσης τις επιβλαβείς αποθέσεις μιας ουσίας που είναι γνωστή ως β-αμυλοειδές, το οποίο είναι το κύριο συστατικό της πλάκας στους εγκεφάλους των ασθενών με νόσο του Αλτσχάιμερ.<br/><br/>Μια διπλή-τυφλή μελέτη που δημοσιεύθηκε στο τεύχος Ιουλίου 2008 του περιοδικού Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine αξιολόγησε την επίδραση του bacopa σε ηλικιωμένους ασθενείς. Η μελέτη επιβεβαίωσε ότι το bacopa αύξησε τη γνωστική απόδοση μειώνοντας παράλληλα το άγχος. Σύμφωνα με τους συγγραφείς, τα οφέλη που επιτεύχθηκαν σε αυτή τη μελέτη επιβεβαίωσαν τα αποτελέσματα προγενέστερων ερευνών.<br/><br/>Μια μελέτη 90 ημερών που δημοσιεύθηκε στο τεύχος Δεκεμβρίου 2008 της Phytotherapy Research επιβεβαιώνει τα γνωστικά οφέλη που είχαν προηγουμένως καταδειχθεί σε άλλες μελέτες bacopa. Η Bacopa βελτίωσε σημαντικά την ικανότητα των συμμετεχόντων να αποθηκεύουν προσωρινά και να χρησιμοποιούν τις πληροφορίες που απαιτούνται για την ολοκλήρωση μιας πολύπλοκης εργασίας. Η διπλή-τυφλή μελέτη έδειξε επίσης ότι η bacopa μείωσε το χρόνο που απαιτείται για την επεξεργασία των οπτικών πληροφοριών.<br/><br/>Εκτός από την ενίσχυση της μετάδοσης νευρικών σημάτων, οι επιστήμονες υποθέτουν ότι η μπακόπα αυξάνει τη γνωστική λειτουργία μειώνοντας το άγχος. Πολυάριθμες μελέτες δείχνουν ότι το άγχος παρεμποδίζει την ικανότητα εκτέλεσης εργασιών που απαιτούν γνωστικές λειτουργίες υψηλότερου επιπέδου, όπως η μάθηση και η απομνημόνευση. Το άγχος διαταράσσει τους βιοχημικούς αγγελιοφόρους και την υγιή μετάδοση νευρικών σημάτων. Το Bacopa ανακουφίζει από το στρες και αποκαθιστά μια αίσθηση ηρεμίας αυξάνοντας τα επίπεδα ακετυλοχολίνης, η οποία μειώνει τον καρδιακό ρυθμό και σας δίνει τη δυνατότητα να πάρετε βαθύτερες αναπνοές.<br/><br/>Το Doxiderol είναι ένας πολύ καλός τρόπος για να αποκτήσετε τα οφέλη του bacopa. Αυτό το ολιστικό συμπλήρωμα περιέχει επίσης άλλα φυσικά συστατικά που προάγουν την υγεία του εγκεφάλου και υποστηρίζουν την ικανότητά σας να επικεντρωθείτε και να επικεντρωθείτε σε πολύπλοκες εργασίες καθώς και να απομνημονεύσετε πληροφορίες. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Όταν γεννήθηκε και μεγάλωσε, όμως, οι δυνάμεις της σφραγίστηκαν και ήταν πολύ λιγότερο ισχυρή. Από την ήττα εκείνου που σφραγίζει τις δυνάμεις της, η Καγκόμε έχει φτάσει στο πλήρες δυναμικό της.<br/><br/>Κάνοντας μια φυσική σύνδεση, η Kagome έχει την ικανότητα να εξαγνίζει τόσο το δηλητήριο όσο και το σκοτάδι από ένα υποκείμενο (ζωντανό και άψυχο). Για να το κάνει αυτό, προβάλλει τις πνευματικές της δυνάμεις μέσω του χεριού της.<br/><br/>Με το πλήρες δυναμικό της, η Kagome έχει την ικανότητα να δημιουργεί ένα φράγμα γύρω από τον εαυτό της και να το επεκτείνει γύρω από τους άλλους. Είναι ένα φράγμα σε σχήμα θόλου που μπορεί να καταστρέψει αδύναμους δαίμονες που έρχονται σε επαφή με το φράγμα.<br/><br/>ΒΕΛΤΙΩΜΕΝΟ ΜΑΤΙ<br/>Ο Καγκόμε έχει την ικανότητα να βλέπει πράγματα που συχνά είναι αόρατα στο ανθρώπινο μάτι: φαντάσματα, πνεύματα, θεϊκές και κακές αύρες.<br/><br/>ΕΥΘΥΝΕΣ ΜΕ ΟΠΛΑ<br/>Η Καγκόμε έχει την ικανότητα να χρησιμοποιεί τόξο και βέλος. Έχει εκπαιδευτεί από μόνη της, και μετά από χρόνια εξάσκησης, το βέλος της σπάνια χάνει το σημάδι του. Παράλληλα με αυτό, η Καγκόμε έχει την ικανότητα να εμποτίζει τα βέλη της με δυνάμεις. Μπορεί να εμποτίσει ένα βέλος με τις πνευματικές της δυνάμεις που τους επιτρέπουν να διεισδύσουν σε δαιμονικές δυνάμεις, να καταστρέψουν ξόρκια και να εξαγνίσουν αντικείμενα. Έχει την ικανότητα να εμποτίζει τα βέλη της με εξαγνιστική ενέργεια για να εξαγνίσει το δηλητήριο καθώς και ισχυρές, μακρινές δαιμονικές επιθέσεις. Και, τέλος, έχει την ικανότητα να παρακάμπτει τους άλλους με το βέλος της: Αν ο στόχος της τύχει να βρίσκεται πίσω από ένα φράγμα ή έναν όμηρο, το βέλος μπορεί να τηλεμεταφερθεί και να χτυπήσει μόνο τον στόχο της.<br/><br/>Οι υπόλοιπες ικανότητές της έχουν γίνει μάλλον ασήμαντες καθώς σχετίζονται με το ταξίδι στο χρόνο (μέσω του Οστεοφάγου Πηγαδιού), το Κόσμημα Σίκον, ή την προηγούμενη ενσάρκωσή της.<br/><br/>τον κανόνα<br/><br/>Η Kagome έχει τραβηχτεί λίγες μέρες μετά την αποφοίτησή της από το λύκειο, ωστόσο, πριν ανοίξει ξανά το Bone Eater's Well για να της επιτρέψει να επιστρέψει στο παρελθόν μόνιμα.<br/><br/>ελεύθερο στυλ<br/><br/>αναμνήσεις<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Ο ήχος του ονόματός της ήταν ένας μαλακός ψίθυρος στο πίσω μέρος του μυαλού της, σαν ένα κάλεσμα που διαθλάστηκε από τον άνεμο. Ήταν ο ήχος μιας μακρινής μνήμης, μιας φωνής που είχε αρχίσει να ξεχνά αλλά απεγνωσμένα προσκολλημένη σε όλους τους ίδιους. Ήταν η φωνή της μητέρας της, διεστραμμένη στη θλίψη της χαμένης κόρης της. Μετά από όλα, η Καγκόμε εξορίστηκε χωρίς ίχνος. Θυμόταν ζωηρά εκείνες τις στιγμές, τον τρόπο που είχε ξεκινήσει η μέρα, τι είχε φάει για πρωινό και το τελευταίο πράγμα που είχε πει στη μητέρα της. Ήταν στοιχειωμένο, εκείνες οι αναμνήσεις, γιατί ήταν όπως κάθε άλλη φορά που είχε γλιστρήσει ανάμεσα σε κόσμους. Είχε ξυπνήσει, είχε μείνει άναυδος, επειδή δεν είχε κανένα σκοπό έξω από το σχολείο. μπορούσε να βρει δουλειά, και ήταν προγραμματισμένη για συνέντευξη εκείνη την ημέρα. Η καρδιά της δεν είχε μπει σε αυτό, αλλά ήταν αυτό που έπρεπε να κάνει.<br/><br/>Θυμήθηκε το αίσθημα του φόβου, το ρούφηξε και έδωσε στον εαυτό της μια εμψυχωτική ομιλία ότι θα μπορούσε να το κάνει αυτό, ότι θα μπορούσε να προχωρήσει στη ζωή που ήταν γραφτό να κάνει τώρα που τα πράγματα είχαν τακτοποιηθεί στο παρελθόν. Φυσικά, είχε το παρατεταμένο αίσθημα ότι δεν ανήκε πια στον δικό της χρόνο ή στη δική της ζωή.<br/><br/>Η Kagome θυμήθηκε την αίσθηση του ξύλου κάτω από τα δάχτυλά της, τον τρόπο που το χέρι της είχε κουλουριαστεί στη λαβή για να γλιστρήσει την πόρτα ανοιχτή. Θυμήθηκε ότι σταμάτησε, γυρίζοντας στη μητέρα της με ένα φωτεινό και ζωντανό χαμόγελο καθώς κούνησε τον εαυτό της από το τραύλισμα της. "Απογειώνομαι". Θυμήθηκε πόσο δυνατή ακουγόταν η φωνή της, το χαμόγελο στα χείλη της μητέρας της καθώς τα μάτια της έλαμπαν από υπερηφάνεια. Η μητέρα της την αποχαιρέτησε, κάτι που δεν φαινόταν διαφορετικό από πριν αλλά με κάποιο τρόπο το βάρος των λέξεων τακτοποιήθηκε βαρύτερα στους ώμους της Καγκόμε τόσο περισσότερο αντανακλούσε.<br/><br/>Εν συντομία, οι σκέψεις έτρεμαν προς τα εμπρός, αναρωτώμενος αν η μητέρα της ανησυχούσε για αυτήν, της έλειπαν όπως εκείνη. Η Kagome μπορούσε να παραδεχτεί ανοιχτά ότι η δύναμη της μητέρας της, η υποστήριξή της για το γεγονός ότι η κόρη της γλίστρησε στο χρόνο τόσο συχνά. Υπήρχαν στιγμές που θεωρούσε τον εαυτό της αδύναμο επειδή δεν είχε τη γυναίκα να στηρίζεται.<br/><br/>Μπορούσε να θυμηθεί τη μετατόπιση στον αέρα, τη θερμοκρασία που ήταν αξιοσημείωτα διαφορετική από ό,τι περίμενε, ανοιγοκλείνοντας τα μάτια της στο ξαφνικό και άγνωστο περιβάλλον. Δεν ήταν το ιερό της οικογένειάς της και όταν γύρισε για να πάει πίσω, για να γλιστρήσει μέσα από την πόρτα που είχε περάσει, συναντήθηκε με άγνωστο και κρύο μέταλλο κάτω από τα ακροδάχτυλά της και ένα εσωτερικό που δεν ήταν η είσοδος του σπιτιού της. Ένας άντρας στεκόταν μπροστά της, πίσω από έναν πάγκο, που την κοιτούσε με μάτια τόσο πλατιά όσο τα δικά της.<br/><br/>Δεν πανικοβλήθηκε, τουλάχιστον, που ήταν σκισμένη στο χρόνο και τοποθετημένη σε αδύνατες καταστάσεις, τουλάχιστον έφτιαξε τη δύναμη της θέλησής σου, όσον αφορά τα περίεργα γεγονότα. Γιατί δεν ήταν κάθε μέρα που κάποιος βρέθηκε να σέρνεται στο παρελθόν από έναν δαίμονα, με σκοπό να ξεριζώσει ένα ισχυρό κόσμημα από το σώμα τους που δεν ήξεραν καν ότι ήταν εκεί. Και μετά υπήρχε το γεγονός ότι είχε θρυμματίσει είπε ισχυρό κόσμημα σε ποιος ξέρει πόσα κομμάτια και είχε επιφορτιστεί με την ανεύρεση τους. Τέτοια πράγματα δεν ήταν φυσιολογικά, και είχε ανάγκη να συμμαζευτεί και να κυλήσει με αυτό μόλις συνειδητοποίησε ότι αυτή ήταν η πραγματικότητά της. Φαινόταν τόσο απλό, απλά μάζεψε τα θραύσματα και φτιάξε το κόσμημα.<br/><br/>Αλλά δεν ήταν εύκολο, υπήρχαν πολλοί δαίμονες μετά τα θραύσματα και το ίδιο το κόσμημα και ένας ιδιαίτερα ισχυρός δαίμονας με μια ευχή που ήταν αποφασισμένος να δει εκπληρωμένη. Μέχρι σήμερα, δεν είχε μάθει ποτέ την επιθυμία του αλλά ήξερε ότι δεν είχε ποτέ παραχωρηθεί ούτε μια φορά που είχε ολοκληρώσει το αναθεματισμένο πράγμα. Είχε καταστρέψει τόσες πολλές ζωές για χάρη του τίποτα. Κατέστρεψε τόσες πολλές ζωές για ένα τόσο μάταιο έργο. Ο Ναράκου ήταν ο πιο δύσκολος εχθρός, και αυτός που ήταν το επίκεντρο όλων όσων είχαν πάει στραβά σε όλες τις ζωές των φίλων της.<br/><br/>Αλλά, ήταν αυτή η αναξιοπιστία, εκείνη η αναγκαιότητα να κυλήσει με ό,τι συνέβαινε και η δύναμη της θέλησης που είχε κερδίσει από την περιπέτειά της που θυμόταν να ζωγραφίζει για να καταλήξει σε μια ιστορία που ταίριαζε στη στιγμή που δεν φαινόταν τόσο ιδιότροπη ή τραβηγμένη. Έπρεπε να την πιστέψουν, έπρεπε να επιβιώσει.<br/><br/>Στη συνέχεια, αντιμετώπισε χειρότερα από έναν άντρα σε ένα κατάστημα φωτογραφικών μηχανών. είχε πει ψέματα μέσα από τα δόντια της για να σώσει τη ζωή της στο παρελθόν.<br/><br/>"Έψαχνα για δουλειά." Στο τέλος, δεν ήταν ένα πλήρες ψέμα. Στο κάτω-κάτω, είχε ξεκινήσει από το σπίτι της με την πρόθεση να παρακολουθήσει μια συνέντευξη για δουλειά. Η κατάσταση του φορέματός της θα το πιστοποιούσε τουλάχιστον τόσο πολύ. Ήταν ένα από τα ευκολότερα ψεύδη που είχε πει ποτέ.<br/><br/>Και, για κάποιο λόγο, αυτός ο τρελός την προσέλαβε.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Η Καγκομέντ κύλησε στο κρεβάτι της καθώς έσπρωχνε πίσω τις μακρινές αναμνήσεις, αρνούμενη να αναγνωρίσει ότι ήταν πραγματικά ξύπνια. Έκλεισε τα μάτια της, ήθελε να κοιμηθεί για να έρθει και συναντιόταν μόνο με αναμνήσεις. Η ηχώ ενός τραγουδιού τραγουδούσε στο βάθος των αναμνήσεων της, ένα τραγούδι που συχνά την βασάνιζε, δίνοντας το ίδιο όνομα με εκείνη. Η φωνή που τραγουδούσε δεν θύμιζε πλέον τη μητέρα της, αλλά τις φωνές των παιδιών με τα οποία είχε παίξει συχνά μεγαλώνοντας. Ξανατηλεφώνησαν τις αναμνήσεις, παρόλο που είχαν περάσει χρόνια από τότε που ξεκίνησε αυτό το live, παρόλο που ήταν ευτυχισμένη σε αυτή τη ζωή, το κάλεσμα αυτών των αναμνήσεων ήταν πολύ δυνατό.<br/><br/>Ξαφνικά, έπεφτε πάλι μέσα τους και ο ύπνος την ξέφευγε και πάλι. Παρατηρούσε τον εαυτό της στην αγκαλιά της οικογένειάς της ενώ η Inuyasha τραβιόταν πίσω στο πηγάδι, κοιτώντας τόσο έκπληκτη όσο είχε νιώσει. Οι αναμνήσεις εκείνης της στιγμής, εκείνα τα συναισθήματα, ήταν ακόμα τόσο έντονα. Το αίσθημα της θλίψης και της θλίψης άκμασε και πάλι αν και είχε περάσει τόσος καιρός από τότε που είχε νιώσει σαν να είχε ξεριζωθεί από οτιδήποτε είχε σημασία για εκείνη.<br/><br/>Φυσικά η οικογένειά της είχε σημασία, και χάρηκε που βρέθηκε ξανά στην αγκαλιά τους. Ακόμα δεν μπορούσε να εξηγήσει τον τρόπο που ένιωθε χωρισμένη στα δύο, με αντιμαχόμενες επιθυμίες να είναι τόσο στο παρελθόν όσο και στο παρόν της. Θυμόταν τις μάταιες προσπάθειες να πηδήξει μέσα από το πηγάδι, τα δάχτυλα να γδάρουν στο έδαφος σε μια απεγνωσμένη έκκληση να την αφήσουν να επιστρέψει. Τον πρώτο μήνα στο σπίτι, δεν κοιμόταν τόσο πολύ όσο έκλαιγε.<br/><br/>Η Elysion είχε γαρνιρίσει μια παρόμοια αντίδραση, αν και δεν ήταν τόσο άγρια επειδή δεν ήξερε ακριβώς πού είχε γλιστρήσει μέσα ούτε ήξερε πού θα μπορούσε να σκουληκώσει το δρόμο της επιστροφής. Οι εξερευνήσεις της ήταν λεπτές μεταξύ της δουλειάς της και της προσπάθειας να εγκατασταθεί σε αυτή τη ζωή. Και ενώ δεν προσπάθησε τόσο σκληρά όσο όταν προσπάθησε να επιστρέψει στο παρελθόν, το πάθος της ήταν δεκαπλάσιο επειδή δεν είχε δεσμούς με αυτόν τον κόσμο.<br/><br/>Στις παράλογες στιγμές της, νόμιζε ότι το Κόσμημα την είχε τραβήξει πίσω και βρήκε μια νέα κόλαση για να κατοικήσει. Μια νέα κόλαση που θα την ανάγκαζε να κάνει μια ευχή, αλλά θυμήθηκε πολύ καθαρά ότι είχε ευχηθεί να φύγει για πάντα. Αυτό δεν σταμάτησε τα όνειρά της, τις στιγμές που ξύπνησε μέσα στη νύχτα κλαίγοντας και εκείνες οι αναμνήσεις από το παρελθόν της ήταν οι δυσκολότερες να τις αντιμετωπίσεις, οι δυσκολότερες να τις ξεχάσεις. Η καρδιά της άρχισε να τρέχει πανικόβλητη καθώς γύριζε πάλι στο κρεβάτι της, η ανάσα της έγινε πάλη καθώς πολέμησε ενάντια σε μια κρίση πανικού που προκλήθηκε από το περιπλανώμενο μυαλό της τόσο αργά μέσα στη νύχτα.<br/><br/>Μισούσε το αίσθημα τόσο αδύναμη, τόσο φοβισμένη.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Η Kagome τελικά τράβηξε τον εαυτό της από το κρεβάτι, το δωμάτιό της φωτισμένο με ένα χλωμό φως που ήταν αρκετό για να την οδηγήσει στο μπάνιο. Το πρώτο της πρωινό στην Ελυσίωνα ήταν παρόμοιο με αυτό, μόνο που ήταν σε χειρότερη κατάσταση.<br/><br/>Είχε βρει ένα μέρος για να κοιμηθεί, καταφέρνοντας να κάνει μια συμφωνία με τον ιδιοκτήτη του κτιρίου για να της επιτρέψει να μείνει ένα μικρό χρονικό διάστημα χωρίς να πληρώσει. Ίσως ήταν η επιρροή του Μιρόκου που της επέτρεψε να πετύχει τέτοιες συμφωνίες, καθώς ο μοναχός ήταν γνωστός για τον τρόπο του σε γοητευτικούς (ή εξαπατώντας) ανθρώπους για να τους δώσει περισσότερα από αρκετά για το έργο που είχαν κάνει. Ο μοναχός ήταν πάντα έτσι, αφού είχαν πρωτοσυναντηθεί. Θα ισχυριζόταν ότι η κατοικία ενός άρχοντα είναι στοιχειωμένη όταν δεν ήταν ή, θα ισχυριζόταν ότι ήταν αντικείμενο επίθεσης όταν δεν θα ήταν. Θα πουλούσε τις πτέρυγες και τις γοητείες του για τόσο υψηλές τιμές. Δούλεψε πρακτικά κάθε φορά και αναρωτήθηκε γιατί οι άνθρωποι ήταν τόσο πρόθυμοι να τον εμπιστευτούν.<br/><br/>Ίσως ήταν το χαμόγελό του, ή το γεγονός ότι ήταν μοναχός που οι άνθρωποι του παρελθόντος ήταν τόσο πρόθυμοι να καταρρεύσουν. Πάντα έκανε αυτό που ήταν σωστό και ήταν ένα σύμβολο δύναμης για εκείνη κατά καιρούς, όταν θα έσπρωχνε μέσα από τα πάντα, προκειμένου να κάνει αυτό που ήταν σωστό. Έσπρωξε μέσα από το γεγονός ότι πέθαινε, ότι ήταν καταραμένος, και προσπάθησε να κάνει κάτι γι 'αυτό αντί να κυλιέται στη μοίρα του. είχε ωθήσει τον εαυτό του στο όριο στο χρόνο που οδηγεί στην τελική μάχη τους. Και είχε χαρεί που είχαν νικήσει τον Ναράκου πριν αυτός γίνει υποκείμενο στην ίδια μοίρα με τον πατέρα του, και τον πατέρα του πριν από αυτόν.<br/><br/>Ωστόσο, όσον αφορά τη δική της γοητεία, ήταν πιο δίκαιη από τη φίλη της και έκανε τη συμφωνία λογική. Αμφέβαλλε ότι οποιοσδήποτε σε αυτόν τον κόσμο θα πλήρωνε βαρύ τίμημα για έναν εξορκισμό ή για την εξολόθρευση δαιμόνων. Αλλά ήταν αρκετά έξυπνη, και αρκετά έξυπνη, για να κάνει μια καλή συμφωνία.<br/><br/>Αλλά τώρα, η Kagome ήταν σε ένα καλύτερο μέρος αν και το βλέμμα στο πρόσωπό της έμοιαζε το ίδιο.<br/><br/>Μια γρήγορη ματιά σε ένα ρολόι στον τοίχο της είπε ότι θα μπορούσε να προσπαθήσει να κοιμηθεί περισσότερο. Αντ' αυτού έκανε ντους, χρησιμοποιώντας το κρύο νερό για να διώχνει τους δαίμονές της, για να γεμίσει τους πνεύμονές της με μια απότομη λήψη αναπνοής και να αναγκάσει τον εαυτό της να ξυπνήσει.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Δεν έπιασε.<br/><br/>Όχι με τον τρόπο που ήθελε. Το κρύο νερό σίγουρα ανάγκασε τον αέρα στα πνευμόνια της, ανάγκασε το μυαλό της να ξυπνήσει και τους μυς να αρπάξουν. Ένα πικρό γέλιο τραβήχτηκε από τα χείλη της καθώς έκλινε το κεφάλι της πίσω και βρήκε τον εαυτό της να θυμάται περισσότερα. Σήμερα, δεν επρόκειτο να τους ξεφύγει τόσο εύκολα, δεν επρόκειτο να αναρρώσει τόσο απλά, να αναρρώσει μόνο και μόνο επειδή το ήθελε.<br/><br/>Μερικές φορές, δεν μπορείς να αποφύγεις τις σκέψεις που ήθελες, ακόμα κι όταν ήσουν σίγουρος ότι τις είχες ξεπεράσει.<br/><br/>Η Σάντο θα ήταν μεγάλη βοήθεια σε αυτή την κατάσταση. Η δαιμονική Φόνισσα ήταν η καλύτερή της φίλη, θα έφτανε μέχρι το σημείο να την αποκαλέσει αδελφή που δεν είχε ποτέ. Μια μεγαλύτερη αδελφή που ήταν σοφή, είχε πάντα το μέρος της όταν προέκυπτε πρόβλημα. Ιδιαίτερα προβλήματα αγοριών, όταν τέτοια πράγματα ήταν μάλλον ασήμαντα αλλά ήταν διασκεδαστικό να έχει ένα φλερτ και για τη φίλη της να είναι θυμωμένη για λογαριασμό της όταν η Inuyasha την έκανε λυπημένη. Άλλωστε, πολλές φορές ο μισοδαίμονας έτρεχε στο πλευρό του νεκρού εραστή του και της ράγιζε την καρδιά περισσότερες από μία φορές.<br/><br/>Αλλά, η Σάντο την ενέπνευσε και με άλλους τρόπους. Μετά από όλα όσα είχε αντιμετωπίσει η γυναίκα, ήταν πάντα τόσο δυνατή, τόσο σίγουρη... Ακόμα και στις εποχές που είχε αμφιβάλλει για τον εαυτό της, πάντα τα κατάφερνε. Θαύμαζε ότι είχε την ικανότητα να επιβιώσει αφού έχασε όλη την οικογένειά της -- η υπενθύμιση αυτού συχνά ώθησε την Kagome να επιβιώσει, επειδή έχασε τους πάντες σε αυτόν τον κόσμο -- και στη συνέχεια να έχει τον αδελφό της να γίνει πιόνι του Ναράκου. Δεν ήταν εύκολο, δεν θα μπορούσε να ήταν κάτι σε αυτό που θα μπορούσε να αντιμετωπίσει ο καθένας και να συνεχίσει να προχωράει. Ακόμα χαμογελούσε, ακόμα και με αυτόν τον πόνο και εκείνες τις υπενθυμίσεις... Ήταν συχνά τόσο φωτεινή, ακόμα και στις πιο σκοτεινές εποχές.<br/><br/>Και αυτή τη στιγμή, ήθελε να σκύψει στο πλευρό της μεγαλύτερης γυναίκας, για να παρηγορηθεί από το γεγονός ότι ήταν εκεί και ήταν υποστηρικτική. Ένιωθε ότι ο Σάντο με κάποιο τρόπο θα τα κατάφερνε όλα αυτά, και θα πρόσφερε μερικές λέξεις δύναμης και κατανόησης. Ήταν στιγμές σαν αυτές που έκαναν αυτά τα ξόρκια χειρότερα, η συνεχής υπενθύμιση ότι ήταν χωρίς την οικογένειά της.<br/><br/>"Δεν θέλω να μείνω μόνη." Έκλαιγε δυνατά στη μοναξιά της, ο ήχος του ντους πνίγοντας την έκκληση.<br/><br/>Δεν φοβόταν να το παραδεχτεί.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Είχε περάσει άλλη μια ώρα πριν το καταλάβει, το δέρμα της ήταν κρύο από το νερό και έμοιαζε σαν πάγος να έτρεχε στις φλέβες της, δεν είχε καταλάβει ότι είχε αρχίσει να τρέμει μέχρι που έφτασε το χέρι της για να κλείσει το νερό και να τελειώσει το ντους της. Η Kagome δεν αναζήτησε ξανά το δικό της βλέμμα στον καθρέφτη, αντ' αυτού, τυλίχτηκε σε πετσέτες και ποδοπατήθηκε από το μπάνιο, ανέβηκε τις σκάλες και μπήκε στην κουζίνα της. Άρχισε να φτιάχνει ένα ελαφρύ πρωινό, διαβάζοντας άπραγα τις σημειώσεις της για την ημέρα καθώς το φαγητό μαγειρευόταν.<br/><br/>Η καριέρα της πραγματικά απογειωνόταν τα τελευταία χρόνια. Οι φωτογραφίες της προβλήθηκαν σε πολλές γκαλερί, το όνομά της άρχισε να συχνάζει σε πολλά χείλη για όσους ενδιαφέρονταν για τη φωτογραφία.<br/><br/>Η δουλειά που είχε ζητήσει για ένα καπρίτσιο τα είχε προκαλέσει όλα. Είχε σταθεί πολύ πιο τυχερή από ότι περίμενε να είναι σε αυτόν τον κόσμο. Ποτέ δεν ήταν αρκετά τυχερή για να γλιστρήσει πίσω μέσα από τις ρωγμές στον δικό της κόσμο, αλλά αρκετά τυχερή για να τα πάει καλά. Καθώς γύριζε πίσω στη σόμπα, θυμόταν τον καιρό που είχε εγκαταλείψει τελικά την επιστροφή της στο σπίτι. Ήταν περίπου δύο χρόνια στη ζωή της εδώ, καθώς είχε αρχίσει να επιχειρεί στη φωτογραφία ως κάτι περισσότερο από ένα χόμπι αλλά κάτι με το οποίο θα μπορούσε να κάνει ένα όνομα για τον εαυτό της.<br/><br/>Εκείνη η μέρα ήταν ιδιαίτερα ευχάριστη, ο ήλιος ήταν ψηλά στον ουρανό και είχε βρει τον εαυτό της να βγάζει μερικές φωτογραφίες από το φυσικό τοπίο. Ένα μικρό αγόρι είχε κρυφτεί σε ένα από τα φυτά, και είχε πιάσει μια εικόνα της στιγμής που το πρόσωπό του είχε εγκατασταθεί σε ένα χαρούμενο, άτακτο χαμόγελο τη στιγμή πριν πηδήξει έξω για να τρομάξει το θήραμά του. Της θύμιζε τη Σίππου, το μικρό κιτσούνι που είχε, ουσιαστικά, υιοθετήσει. Κι αυτός, επίσης, είχε ξεσκιστεί από την οικογένειά του όταν πρωτοσυναντήθηκαν. Ο πατέρας του σκοτώθηκε και ήταν αποφασισμένος να τον εκδικηθεί. Όσο ήταν νέος, φαινόταν τόσο ώριμος στις πρώτες τους συναντήσεις.<br/><br/>Ίσως ήταν η επιρροή του Inuyasha που επέτρεψε στο κιτ να ενεργήσει ξανά σαν παιδί, να είναι νέος και ιδιότροπος μερικές φορές ενώ άλλοι ήταν πιο ώριμος. Της πρόσφερε παρηγοριά με τον δικό του τρόπο, και προσπάθησε να τον φροντίσει όπως θα τον φρόντιζε η ίδια αν και ήταν τόσο νέα τότε. Ωστόσο, τα νιάτα της δεν την εμπόδισαν να καταλάβει πώς να τον φροντίζει ή να τον φροντίζει όπως το παιδί της. Η καρδιά της διογκώθηκε όταν χαμογελούσε, όταν είχε χαρεί τόσο πολύ για το δώρο του με τα κραγιόνια και είχε το χρόνο να κάνει τέχνη. Ήταν τόσο περήφανη για κάθε σχέδιο που είχε τελειώσει που ήξερε ότι έτσι θα ένιωθε μια μητέρα σε μια τέτοια κατάσταση.<br/><br/>Ο πόνος που την είχε σκίσει ήταν πάρα πολύ, πάρα πολύ ξαφνικός. Της έλειπε και ήθελε να δει πόσο είχε μεγαλώσει από τότε που είχε φύγει.<br/><br/>Για να γλιτώσει κάθε περαιτέρω πόνο, κάθε ψεύτικη ελπίδα... τα παράτησε και επικεντρώθηκε στο να καλυτερέψει τον εαυτό της.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Μόνο αφού είχε τελειώσει συνειδητοποίησε ότι είχε ξεχάσει οποιοδήποτε είδος μπαχαρικών ή γεύσης στο φαγητό. Ήταν πολύ αργά τώρα για να θυμηθεί κάτι τέτοιο, καθώς το μυαλό της ήταν πολύ απασχολημένο με το να θυμάται άλλες λεπτομέρειες της ζωής της που σαφώς είχαν γίνει πιο σημαντικές από το φαγητό της.<br/><br/>"Κάτσε!"<br/><br/>Φυσικά, τίποτα δεν συνέβη όταν είχε θυμώσει φωνάζοντας σε έναν ιδιαίτερα απογοητευτικό πελάτη που της θύμιζε τον ημι-δαίμονα. Ήταν ιδιαίτερα πεισματάρης και αγενής, θέλοντας μια φωτογραφία που πήρε το δρόμο του αντί να το αφήσει να λειτουργήσει φυσικά. Θα μπορούσες να προσπαθήσεις να αναγκάσεις τα άγρια ζώα να συμπεριφερθούν όπως ήθελες, αλλά σπάνια κάποιος τα κατάφερε με τη βία. Η Inuyasha δεν ήταν τόσο κακή, ωστόσο. Η Inuyasha είχε μάθει πριν αναγκαστεί να απομακρυνθεί από αυτόν. Είχε γίνει πιο ευγενικός, πιο κατανοητός, πιο ώριμος αν και υπήρχαν φορές που ήταν ακόμα παιδαριώδης και αλαζόνας.<br/><br/>Θυμάται πόσο κόκκινα είχαν καεί τα μάγουλά της, αλλά πώς στάθηκε στο έδαφος της και τον απέλυσε. Του είπε ότι αρνήθηκε να δουλέψει για οποιονδήποτε ή με όποιον ήθελε να διαστρεβλώσει κάτι πέρα από τη φύση του, πέρα από τις δικές του επιθυμίες.<br/><br/>Θα έπρεπε να είχε συγκρίνει τον άνδρα με τον Ναράκου και όχι με τον Ινούγιασα, αν και η πελάτισσά της δεν είχε τόσο ακραίες προθέσεις, τουλάχιστον το συναίσθημα μετά ήταν μια ευχάριστη ανάμνηση. Η ελευθερία να ξέρει ότι είχε φτάσει τόσο μακριά που θα μπορούσε να αρνηθεί τη δουλειά που δεν ήθελε να κάνει, να είναι το δικό της πρόσωπο που ήταν ανεξάρτητο από τους άλλους. Αν και άκουσε φήμες μέρες αργότερα με λόγια που είχαν σκοπό να την συκοφαντήσουν.<br/><br/>Υπερασπίστηκε τον εαυτό της δίκαια, όπως έκανε προς το τέλος του ταξιδιού της.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Το πρωινό φως άρχισε να σέρνεται στο σπίτι της, θυμίζοντάς της ξανά το πέρασμα του χρόνου. Και πάλι, σκέφτηκε τον κατάλογο των πραγμάτων που έπρεπε να κάνει και συζήτησε για το από πού να ξεκινήσει. Ή, αν θα έπρεπε καν να ξεκινήσει. Με το πώς ξεκίνησε η μέρα, δεν ήξερε αν θα μπορούσε να το θεωρήσει σπουδαία ιδέα. ήταν αμφίβολο αν θα ήταν επιτυχημένη με το πόσο χαμένη ήταν στον εαυτό της.<br/><br/>Δεν ήθελε να χαλάσει την τελευταία της δουλειά, γιατί το είχε ξανακάνει σε μερικές περιπτώσεις, δεν ήταν ευχάριστο να προσπαθείς να συνέλθεις από μια ολοκληρωτική καταστροφή.<br/><br/>Η Kagome θυμόταν την αίσθηση της ακριβούς, ολοκαίνουριας, κάμερας που γλιστρούσε από τα χέρια της. Δεν ήταν έτοιμη να την υποστηρίξει, επειδή μόλις την είχε βγάλει από την τσάντα της. Μια δραματική, over-the-top, γεμάτη με κραυγές που έκανε συχνά όταν ήταν πολύ, πολύ νεότερη. Το άλλο μέρος της είχε παραμείνει παγωμένο στη θέση του ενώ το φακό της είχε καταρρεύσει εντελώς και η υπόλοιπη κάμερα είχε σπάσει μαζί με αυτό.<br/><br/>Βλέποντας τον αδελφό της Inuyasha, έναν πλήρη δαίμονα, να στέκεται μπροστά της ήταν το τελευταίο πράγμα που περίμενε όταν είχε κάνει την έξοδο της για τις φωτογραφίες της. Δεν φαινόταν καθόλου τρελλός να βρίσκεται σε έναν εντελώς διαφορετικό κόσμο, αν και δεν ήταν ποτέ η καλύτερη στο να διαβάζει το μυαλό του. Το όνομά του στα χείλη της ήταν τόσο ισχυρό, που μπορούσε να θυμηθεί τα πιο μικρά συναισθήματα όπως εκείνη. Τα χείλη της σκόνταψαν, το στόμα της στέγνωσε και το αναβλύζον αίσθημα ανησυχίας στο στομάχι της την έκανε να αισθάνεται άρρωστη.<br/><br/>Δεν ήθελε να ξεσηκωθούν οι ελπίδες της.<br/><br/>Αλλά, ήθελε να είναι εκεί, ακόμα και αν δεν ήταν φίλοι, ήταν σύμμαχοι, αν μη τι άλλο, αφού είχαν πολεμήσει πλάι-πλάι και κάτι ήταν καλύτερο από το απολύτως τίποτα.<br/><br/>Και η Kagome είχε την αίσθηση να μην του ρίξει τον εαυτό της, να τυλίξει τα χέρια της γύρω του με ανακούφιση ότι ξέροντας ότι δεν ήταν μόνη. Θυμήθηκε ότι τίποτα άλλο δεν είχε σημασία για μέρες καθώς περνούσε χρόνο μαζί του, χωρίς να μιλάει για τον κόσμο τους αλλά μιλώντας (ή, μιλούσε και απλά αναγνώριζε αυτό το γεγονός).<br/><br/>Όταν, ακριβώς, τον ερωτεύτηκε όμως... η Καγκόμε δεν μπορούσε να θυμηθεί... ήταν ένα λεπτό πράγμα, όπως κι εκείνος, αλλά ήξερε ότι το συναίσθημα ήταν εκεί... και της είπε ότι δεν ήταν μόνη της στο γεγονός ότι είχε πέσει, ότι τα συναισθήματα είχαν κάπως ανθίσει.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>Ένα αίσθημα έλλειψης βαρύτητας την προσπέρασε και ξαφνικά τα μάτια της άνοιξαν ενώ το μυαλό της τσίμπησε απελπισμένα για το τελευταίο πράγμα που έκανε. Δεν θυμόταν πότε είχε αποκοιμηθεί στον καναπέ της, αλλά ήξερε ότι το τελευταίο μέρος που είχε βρεθεί ήταν στα πολύ άνετα μαξιλάρια. Το κεφάλι της γέρνει στο στήθος του Σεσουμάρου, παρηγορώντας το γεγονός ότι ήταν εδώ και δεν ήταν μόνη της.<br/><br/>"Καλώς ήρθατε πίσω." Η απάντησή του ήταν ένα απαλό βουητό ως αναγνώριση. Δεν χρειαζόταν να μιλήσει πολύ για να καταλάβει την πρόθεσή του, ή τα υπόλοιπα από αυτά που είχε να πει.<br/><br/>Την μετέφερε πίσω στο κρεβάτι της, την τακτοποίησε σε αυτό με ευκολία. Τα μάτια της συνάντησαν τα δικά του και εκείνη χαμογέλασε εύκολα επειδή δεν υπήρχαν άλλες αναμνήσεις που παρασύρθηκαν πίσω, δεν υπήρχαν άλλες αναμνήσεις που την πείραζαν. Όχι, όποτε ήταν κοντά, ποτέ δεν ξαναμπήκε σε αυτές τις σκέψεις. Είχε βοηθήσει, και τα χρόνια είχαν βοηθήσει.<br/><br/>"Κοιμήθηκε". Διέταξε με ευκολία, τα μάτια της τύλιξαν προς το μέρος του αλλά δεν πάλευε γιατί ήταν κουρασμένη. Το χέρι της αγκάλιαζε σφιχτά προς το μέρος του, ενώ ένιωθε το αντίθετο χέρι του να πιέζει προς το μέτωπό της σε εκτίμηση της ευεξίας της.<br/><br/>"Είμαι εντάξει", είπε, τα λόγια της σταθερά με την υπόσχεσή της.<br/><br/>Ήταν καλά, ήταν ζωντανή και ευτυχισμένη.<br/><br/>. .<br/><br/>φορτωτής<br/><br/>περίληψη<br/><br/>Η Kagome, σε κάποιο σημείο της ζωής της, ήταν μια μάλλον τακτική έφηβη κοπέλα μέχρι που της επιτέθηκε ένας δαίμονας μέσα στο πηγάδι της οικογένειάς της. Ο δαίμονας την έσυρε κάτω στο πηγάδι, το οποίο μαγικά την μετέφερε περίπου 500 χρόνια στο παρελθόν. Εκεί, έμαθε ότι ένα ιερό κόσμημα ήταν κλεισμένο μέσα στο σώμα της καθώς ήταν η μετενσάρκωση μιας ιέρειας που είχε πεθάνει 50 χρόνια πριν την ώρα που την έσυραν. Το κόσμημα ξεριζώθηκε από το σώμα της και ο δαίμονας που την έσυρε στο χρόνο ηττήθηκε από τον ημι-δαίμονα που απελευθέρωσε ο οποίος καρφώθηκε στο δέντρο. Η Kagome έγινε φίλη με τον ημίαιμο δαίμονα, Inuyasha, με τον καιρό και ταξίδεψε μαζί του για να αποκαταστήσει το κόσμημα που η ίδια, γκρεμίστηκε. Αν και δεν ήταν τόσο απλό και εύκολο να γίνει όπως πολλοί δαίμονες και άνθρωποι αναζήτησαν το κόσμημα για τους δικούς τους σκοπούς. Έγινε φίλη με έναν νεαρό δαίμονα Κιτσούνε, έναν μοναχό και μια φονιά δαιμόνων που όλοι ταξίδευαν μαζί της για να αποκαταστήσουν το κόσμημα.<br/><br/>Η ομάδα της, όμως, δεν ήταν αυτή που ολοκλήρωσε το κόσμημα, αλλά ένας κακός ημι-δαίμονας που χειραγώγησε την πλειοψηφία των μεγάλων γεγονότων στις περισσότερες ζωές του συντρόφου της. Όταν τελικά μάζεψε όλα τα κομμάτια του κοσμήματος και έκανε την ευχή του πάνω στο μολυσμένο αντικείμενο, ο Καγκόμε σύρθηκε μέσα στο ίδιο το κόσμημα με την πρόθεση να κάνει μια εγωιστική επιθυμία να την κρατήσει παγιδευμένη μέσα για πάντα, κρατώντας το κόσμημα ζωντανό. Ήταν το πείσμα της Inuyasha που κατάφερε να τη σώσει από το σκοτάδι. Στο τέλος, επέστρεψε στη φυσική της εποχή, τελείωσε το λύκειο όπως περίμενε από ένα κορίτσι του χρονοδιαγράμματος της. Αν και μέρες αργότερα, η Kagome κατέληξε στο Elysion. Βρίσκεται σε αυτόν τον κόσμο εδώ και πέντε χρόνια, και έχει από καιρό εγκαταλείψει την επιστροφή της στο σπίτι.<br/><br/>πλατωνικό<br/><br/>Είναι μάλλον εύκολο για την Kagome να κάνει νέους φίλους, δεν έχει αλλάξει πολύ από τα νιάτα της. Είναι μια χαρούμενη νεαρή γυναίκα που είναι συμπονετική και φιλόξενη στους περισσότερους από όλους στη ζωή της. Στα νιάτα της, έγινε φίλη με δαίμονες όταν οι περισσότεροι θα τους φοβούνταν. Ακόμα και δαίμονες που συνήθιζαν να τρώνε ανθρώπους, έχει γίνει φίλη και άλλαξε τους τρόπους τους (θα ήθελε να σκεφτεί). Τούτου λεχθέντος, είναι πραγματικά εύκολο να γίνει φίλη της εφόσον κάποιος είναι σε θέση να δείξει ότι είναι πρόθυμοι να λυτρωθούν, ή να δείξουν ότι δεν είναι εντελώς κακοί. Αισθάνεται πολύ για όλους όσους συναντά, οπότε είναι δύσκολο για εκείνη να μην ελκύεται από τους άλλους με την επιθυμία να είναι φίλοι.<br/><br/>Ανταγωνιστικό<br/><br/>Ο μόνος τρόπος για να κερδίσεις την οργή της Kagome είναι να είσαι τόσο αξιοθρήνητος, τόσο κακός και τόσο πέρα από την λύτρωση που δεν μπορεί να δει κανένα καλό μέσα σου και μπορεί να δει το καλό σχεδόν σε όλους και τα πάντα. Ένας μισοδαίμονας που έμπλεξε δύο εραστές μεταξύ τους, που καταράστηκε όλη την αντρική γραμμή ενός φίλου της, και μετά έβαλε τον αδερφό της κολλητή της να σκοτώσει την οικογένειά τους... Ναι, δεν την βλέπω να μισεί κανέναν χωρίς αυτούς πραγματικά, πραγματικά να δουλεύει γι' αυτό. Μπορείς να του δώσεις μια ευκαιρία, όμως.<br/><br/>Ρομαντική<br/><br/>Όταν είναι ερωτευμένη, η Kagome είναι μια ισχυρή υποστήριξη, πάντα μένει εκεί ακόμα και όταν τα πράγματα μπορεί να είναι δύσκολα. Ωστόσο, η Kagome δεν ψάχνει για αγάπη, δεν έψαχνε για αγάπη όταν έφτασε έτσι ώστε να μην υπάρχουν οποιεσδήποτε προηγούμενες σχέσεις. Αυτό δεν σημαίνει ότι κάποιος δεν την έχει ερωτευτεί. Μπορεί σίγουρα να είναι το θέμα της ανεκπλήρωτης αγάπης κάποιου, πιθανότατα θα είναι αδιάφορη για αυτό, όμως. Τέλος, η Kagome είναι σήμερα αρραβωνιασμένη με τον Seshoumaru, εκπληκτικά. Είμαι εντελώς ανοιχτός σε πιθανά AU πράγματα, όμως. #3<br/><br/>fandom κόλαση<br/><br/>ηλικία αρχαία<br/><br/>είδος space queen<br/><br/>επάγγελμα που πεθαίνει<br/><br/>Προτιμά αυτή/αυτή<br/><br/>βραβεία<br/><br/>pro she/her est 62woo i suck at plane replies. but ok anyway!!! Το ptune είναι πολύ φιλικό και έχει εκείνη την «κουλ» περσόνα, είναι πραγματικά διασκεδαστικό να είναι τριγύρω, και είναι SUPER καλό να δουλεύεις μαζί του. σαν να είναι υπερ-ασθενής και θα κάνει ό,τι της ζητήσει - είναι πραγματικά εύκολο να δουλέψει μαζί του, σίγουρα σε σύγκριση με άλλα μοντέλα. οπότε μου αρέσει η ιδέα να είναι όλοι τους φίλοι προσανατολισμένοι στη δουλειά στην αρχή και στη συνέχεια να μετατρέπονται σε κάτι περισσότερο. Ο Νεπτούν σίγουρα προσπαθεί να περιτριγυριστεί από ανθρώπους, επειδή του αρέσει να έχει φίλους, και το καγκόμε είναι λίγο πολύ και ο τύπος του; σαν να είναι γλυκιά και να είναι δυνατή γυναίκα, και είναι στην πραγματικότητα καλύτερος φίλος με τις γυναίκες από ότι με τους άνδρες, γιατί, απλά του αρέσει να περιβάλλεται από γυναίκες φίλες που ξέρουν. Λατρεύω τους άντρες μου να είναι σούπερ καλοί φίλοι και να προστατεύουν τις φίλες τους με ειλικρίνεια. Αλλά ω Μ Α Ν αγαπώ τις σχέσεις τύπου pseduo-οικογένειας και η νεπτούν είναι ένα μοναχοπαίδι, οπότε δεν έχει τέτοιες οικογενειακές σχέσεις. Έτσι αυτή που τον προσέχει όλη η μεγάλη αδερφή θα τον έκανε να είναι σαν... γιατί είναι μπερδεμένος αλλά και πραγματικά του αρέσει που LOL! είναι και τα δύο καλά παιδιά, νομίζω ότι θα είναι πραγματικά διασκεδαστικά.<br/><br/>fandom έμβλημα της φωτιάς: μοίρα<br/><br/>ηλικία δέκατη ένατη<br/><br/>είδος Μέρος ανθρώπινος / μέρος δράκος<br/><br/>επάγγελμα εκπρόσωπος κηδεμόνας<br/><br/>Προτιμά αυτή/αυτή<br/><br/>βραβεία<br/><br/>yonder she/her aest 20 δημοσιεύσεις<br/><br/>Δεν έχω δει καθόλου την Inuyasha αλλά... από ότι έχω διαβάσει η Kagome φαίνεται να είναι ένας από εκείνους τους ανθρώπους που θα μπορούσαν να βοηθήσουν την Corrin με τη συναισθηματική της κατάσταση. Πολλά βαραίνουν το μυαλό της από τότε που έπρεπε να πολεμήσει την βιολογική της οικογένεια παρά τη θέλησή της και την τελευταία φορά που τους είδε όλοι λίγο πολύ την μισούσαν. Ειλικρινά δεν έχει ασχοληθεί ακόμα με τα πάντα από τότε που ήταν ουσιαστικά επικεφαλής ενός πλήρους κλίμακας πολέμου.Νιώθω ότι θα μπορούσαν να είναι φίλοι καθώς η Corrin είναι αρκετά ανοιχτή στην προσωπικότητά της, εξαιρετικά αξιόπιστη επίσης. Απλά... κρύβεται και πασχίζει να περάσει πολλά, μέχρι εκεί που το μυαλό μου έχει γίνει τόσο ελεύθερο να προσθέσει/μειώσει/λέει ότι αυτό δεν θα δουλέψει R I P<br/><br/>fandom ΠΡΩΤΑΘΛΗΜΑ<br/><br/>ηλικία TWENTY-TWO<br/><br/>είδη ΑΝΘΡΩΠΙΝΟ<br/><br/>επάγγελμα SINGER / PERFORMER<br/><br/>Προτιμά SHE/HER<br/><br/>βραβεία<br/><br/>ΣΤ'<br/>SHE/HER MST 44 δημοσιεύσεις<br/><br/>Αυτό θα ήταν τόσο γλυκό για την Kagome να είναι φίλη με την Elsa - Και αυτό είναι ένα τόσο θλιβερό κεφαλκανόνι, αλλά σίγουρα θα προσέφερε στην Elsa κάποια παρηγοριά που κάποιος εκτός του κύκλου του βασιλείου της είναι τόσο συμπαθητικός και υποστηρίζει την κατάστασή της. Μ'αρέσει η ιδέα σου για τον Κάγκομε να βγάζει φωτογραφία την Έλσα! Ξέρεις, είναι επίσης τραγουδίστρια/performer σε ένα τοπικό θέατρο οπότε μπορώ να φανταστώ την Kagome να πηγαίνει εκεί για να δει τα πράγματα και μετά να πιάνει την Elsa στα παρασκήνια ή κάτι τέτοιο - και τότε η φιλία θα μπορούσε να ανθίσει από εκεί! Λατρεύω απόλυτα την ιδέα αυτών των δύο να ξοδεύουν ποιοτικό χρόνο bff μαζί κάνοντας τα μικρά αλλά διασκεδαστικά πράγματα που η Έλσα δεν έζησε ποτέ ως παιδί.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Γιατί Πρέπει να Είστε στο Twitter<br/><br/>Αποποίηση Ευθύνης: Δεν είμαι, ούτε έχω ποτέ ισχυριστεί ότι είμαι, ένας γκουρού των μέσων κοινωνικής δικτύωσης. Είμαι απλά ένα άτομο που σκέφτεται πολύ τα πράγματα, και αυτό έχει προκύψει αρκετές φορές.<br/><br/>Δεν είμαι πρώιμος υιοθετημένος. Μερικές φορές μου παίρνει χρόνια να καταλάβω για τι θέλω να χρησιμοποιήσω κάτι πριν μπω πραγματικά σε αυτό, και το Twitter ήταν ένα από αυτά τα πράγματα. Είμαι στο Twitter σοβαρά από περίπου τον Φεβρουάριο του τρέχοντος έτους, οπότε είμαι αρκετά νέος σε αυτό. Παρόλα αυτά, έχω μάθει αρκετά πράγματα, και ήθελα να τα μοιραστώ. Μερικοί άνθρωποι λένε ότι είμαι ένας ωθητής του Twitter, και είμαι, επειδή υπάρχουν πολλοί καλοί λόγοι για να μπεις σε αυτό, και ουσιαστικά κανένα μειονέκτημα.<br/><br/>Τι είναι λοιπόν το Twitter; Αν είστε στο διαδίκτυο, πιθανότατα να το έχετε ακούσει τουλάχιστον. Είναι ένα δίκτυο κοινωνικών μέσων που χρησιμεύει ως φόρουμ για συζητήσεις, ενημερώσεις και ειδήσεις σε ένα μέσο πιο δημόσιο από κάτι όπως το Facebook ή το LinkedIn. Το Facebook έχει να κάνει με το ποιος θέλει να σε βρει, αλλά το Twitter έχει να κάνει με το ποιον θέλεις να βρεις. Οι αγαπημένοι σου συγγραφείς, ηθοποιοί, πολιτικοί, τραγουδιστές και επιστήμονες είναι πιθανότατα στο Twitter. Το ίδιο και οι αγαπημένες σου φιλανθρωπικές οργανώσεις, ραδιοφωνικοί σταθμοί, ειδησεογραφικοί ιστότοποι και καταστήματα. Και θέλουν να τους βρείτε και να ακούσετε τι έχουν να πουν. Όλοι στο Twitter, τουλάχιστον αρχικά, θέλουν να μιλήσουν μαζί σας.<br/><br/>Αλλά γιατί να συμμετάσχεις σε αυτό; Γιατί να είσαι μέρος του; Υπάρχουν πολλοί λόγοι, και θα σου δώσω μερικούς.<br/><br/>Το Twitter είναι ένας πολύ καλός τρόπος για να μάθετε για τα γεγονότα που συμβαίνουν σε όλο τον κόσμο, αλλά και στην κοινότητά σας. Αν ταξιδεύετε και ψάχνετε για πράγματα να κάνετε, είναι ένας πολύ καλός τρόπος για να μάθετε για πράγματα που σχετίζονται με τα ενδιαφέροντά σας (επειδή οι άνθρωποι που ακολουθείτε είναι άνθρωποι που σας ενδιαφέρουν). Ακόμα κι αν δεν ταξιδεύεις, το να ξέρεις για σπουδαία μέρη για να πας τοπικά ή το να ξέρεις ότι οι άνθρωποι που σε ενδιαφέρουν πηγαίνουν σε αυτούς δημιουργεί μια ευκαιρία να τους γνωρίσεις και να δημιουργήσεις μια βαθύτερη σχέση μαζί τους. Αν επιστρέψεις στο πόστο του πάρτι μου, όλοι οι άνθρωποι σε αυτό εκτός από δύο, άκουσα για το στο Twitter και στη συνέχεια συναντήθηκαν στην πραγματική ζωή, και τώρα είμαστε αρκετά καλοί φίλοι. Και όσο περισσότερο το κάνεις αυτό, τόσο περισσότερα πράγματα θα μάθεις, και τόσο περισσότερους ανθρώπους θα γνωρίσεις. Και αν τους ακολουθήσεις στο Twitter, ήδη ξέρεις λίγο για το πώς είναι. Θέλουν να το κάνεις. Το αντίστροφο είναι επίσης αλήθεια, επειδή το tweeting καλεί τους ανθρώπους να δουν πώς είσαι, και μπορούν να κάνουν τις ίδιες επιλογές για σένα.<br/><br/>Έμπνευση και Κίνητρο<br/>Η έμπνευση προέρχεται από τα πιο περίεργα μέρη, και η εισροή tweets σημαίνει ότι υπάρχει πάντα φρέσκο περιεχόμενο για τη φαντασία σας. Έχω μια πρώτη πολιτική που ακολουθεί, έτσι θα ακολουθώ σχεδόν οποιονδήποτε, και στη συνέχεια περιοδικά να περνάω και να μην ακολουθώ τους ανθρώπους. Δεν ξέρω ποιος πρόκειται να φυτέψει το σπόρο ενός νέου blog post ή ενός νέου project μέσα μου, οπότε μου αρέσει να κρατάω τις επιλογές μου ανοιχτές. Αν περιβάλλεσαι από ανθρώπους που είναι φιλόδοξοι, αφοσιωμένοι, γενναιόδωροι και σκληρά εργαζόμενοι, είναι πιο εύκολο να είσαι έτσι, και να πιέζεις τον εαυτό σου. Είναι πιο εύκολο να σκεφτεί κανείς ότι αν μπορούν να προγραμματίσουν γεγονότα, να ξεκινήσουν έργα, ή απλά να σηκωθούν το πρωί, καλά, το ίδιο και εσείς.<br/><br/>Μαθαίνοντας και Lifestyle Bloggers είναι στο Twitter. Bloggers που δεν είναι στην πραγματικότητα μπορεί να είναι τρελός. Και οι άνθρωποι blog για σχεδόν τα πάντα. Αν ψάχνετε να μάθετε κάτι, οι πιθανότητες είναι καλές ότι κάποιος tweeting γι 'αυτό. Επιπλέον, οι υπηρεσίες ειδήσεων και τα καταστήματα είναι επίσης συνδεδεμένα, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι μπορείτε να πάρετε τα νέα σας μέχρι το λεπτό, και να μάθετε για τις πωλήσεις και τις συμφωνίες καθώς ξεκινούν. Ακολούθησε μερικούς κέτερινγκ και δες τι σκαρφίζονται. Χρειάζεται μια ανατροπή για το κοκτέιλ πάρτι; Το Twitter έχει ανθρώπους και γι' αυτό. Οι συστάσεις της ντουλάπας, ή απλά θέλουν να δουν τι κάνουν οι άλλοι άνθρωποι με τη ζωή τους; Είναι όλα εκεί.<br/><br/>Υπάρχουν κάποιες κοινές προκλήσεις που αντιμετωπίζω όταν μιλάω γι' αυτό, και είναι νόμιμα εμπόδια.Μπορεί να φαίνεται αρκετά τρομακτικό, ειδικά αν αργείς στο bandwagon, όπως έκανα κι εγώ. Πέρασα μήνες ακολουθώντας μόνο δύο ανθρώπους και μη ξέροντας τι άλλο να κάνω.<br/><br/>#3: Το Twitter είναι για τους Ναρκισσιστές Βλάκες<br/>Νομίζω ότι αυτό προέρχεται από την ιδέα ότι οι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι κάνουν tweet για τον εαυτό τους και για τον εαυτό τους ως έναν τρόπο να τραβήξουν την προσοχή. Αυτό που δεν καταλαβαίνω είναι γιατί υπάρχει κάτι λάθος με αυτό, ή γιατί το να το κάνεις αυτό κάνει κάποιον ναρκισσιστή ή κόπανο. Αν κάποιος έχει κάτι να πει, θέλει να ακουστεί. Παλιά στεκόσουν στη γωνία του δρόμου και φώναζες. Τώρα μπορείς να φωνάζεις με 140 χαρακτήρες ή λιγότερο. Το Twitter είναι απλά ένας νέος τρόπος να ακουστείς. Τώρα, σίγουρα υπάρχουν ναρκισσιστές βλάκες στο Twitter. Είναι σχεδόν παντού, μερικές φορές οι άνθρωποι είναι μαλάκες, μερικές φορές ένας από αυτούς τους ανθρώπους είμαι εγώ, λυπάμαι που το λέω, μην τους ακολουθείς. Αν δεν σας αρέσει αυτό που λέει κάποιος, είτε πρόκειται για σημεία που κάνει είτε για λεπτομερείς λογαριασμούς των δραστηριοτήτων του μπάνιου του, δεν χρειάζεται να ακούτε στο Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Δεν μπορώ να παρακολουθήσω τα πάντα<br/>Το δεύτερο εμπόδιο που συχνά φέρνουν οι άνθρωποι είναι ότι απλά δεν έχουν χρόνο να παρακολουθούν όλα τα πράγματα που συμβαίνουν στο Twitter. Και ξέρετε τι; Αυτό είναι εντάξει. Να παρακολουθείτε τι μπορείτε. Ίσως να περιπλανιέστε μόνο κάθε λίγες μέρες. Αν είστε ιδιωτικός χρήστης (αντί να κάνετε tweeting για την εταιρεία σας), και ειδικά αρχάριος, αυτό είναι εντάξει. Μέρος από κάτι είναι καλύτερο από όλο το τίποτα.<br/><br/>#1 Δεν έχω τίποτα που να θέλω να βάλω εκεί έξω<br/>Αυτή είναι μακράν η πιο συχνή πρόκληση που εγείρουν οι άνθρωποι. Και δεν έχει καν σημασία. Δεν χρειάζεται να συμμετέχεις στο Twitter για να μιλήσεις. Συμμετάσχετε σε αυτό για να ακούσετε. Και πάλι, οι αγαπημένοι σας συγγραφείς, τραγουδιστές, bloggers, και εφημερίδες είναι εδώ. Αυτή είναι η ευκαιρία σου να τους ακούσεις. Είναι η ευκαιρία σου να κερδίσεις ένα παράθυρο στις ζωές και τις δραστηριότητές τους, και σε προσκαλούν να το κάνεις αυτό. Θέλεις να μάθεις τι θα κάνει η Φελίσια Ντέι στο Σαν Ντιέγκο Κόμικ Κον; Έγινε. Ξέρω ανθρώπους που ακούνε μόνο στο Twitter, και αυτό είναι υπέροχο. Αυτό έκανα για λίγο. Τελικά, ίσως βρείτε κάτι για να τουιτάρετε, ή να κάνετε κάτι για να τουιτάρετε. Ελπίζω να το κάνετε, γιατί θέλω να το ακούσω.<br/><br/>Με λίγα λόγια, αν δεν χρησιμοποιείς το Twitter, νομίζω ότι πρέπει να το κάνεις. Αν δεν το χρησιμοποιείς στο πλήρες, προσπάθησε να το κάνεις. Μην φοβάσαι να ακολουθήσεις πεντακόσιους ανθρώπους, αν όλοι αυτοί οι άνθρωποι λένε πράγματα που σε ενδιαφέρουν. Προσκαλέστε αυτούς τους ανθρώπους σε κομμάτια της ζωής σας, και δείτε πώς βελτιώνεται από την αλληλεπίδραση. Ανυπομονώ να ακούσω από εσάς. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Κανάλια ρίζας<br/><br/>Το SCM Dental χρησιμοποιεί την τελευταία τεχνολογία και τεχνική για να κάνει ένα ριζικό κανάλι μια διαδικασία ουσιαστικά χωρίς πόνο και χαμηλό στρες.<br/><br/>Η περιστροφική ενδοδοντική είναι μια προηγμένη τεχνολογία και τεχνική για την εκτέλεση ενδοδοντικής θεραπείας, ο κλινικός όρος για ένα ριζικό κανάλιΟ όρος "σωλήνας ρίζας" αναφέρεται στη φυσική κοιλότητα στο κέντρο του δοντιού.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Κάτω Ξύλο<br/><br/>Χάιγκεϊτ<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Χάιγκεϊτ (Κομητεία)<br/><br/>Τώρα ονομάζεται Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Μεταξύ 1860 και 1880 το κέντρο σχίστηκε από το Σίτι του Λονδίνου για την κατασκευή υπονόμων, σιδηροδρόμων και νέων δρόμων. Τα σπίτια κατεδαφίστηκαν χωρίς να λαμβάνονται υπόψη οι ένοικοι που έπρεπε να βρουν όποιο κατάλυμα μπορούσαν αλλού. Οι διευθυντές πήγαν στη Λίβο στο Κένσινγκτον και στο Σεντ Τζονς Γουντ, ενώ οι φτωχότεροι συνωστίζονταν στα ρυάκια όπως το Seven Dials και το Lisson Grove. Για όσους ήταν μεταξύ τους, οι υπάλληλοι και οι επιδέξιοι εργάτες, οι κερδοσκοπικοί οικοδόμοι έβαζαν σε σειρά τις αναβαθμισμένες επαύλεις και ο κ. Πούτερ μετακόμισε στο Χόλογουεϊ. Οι άνθρωποι του Μούσγουελ Χιλ παρακολουθούσαν σπίτια να σέρνονται στα χωράφια του Φίνσμπερι Παρκ, πάνω στο Κρόουτς Χιλ και κάτω στην άλλη πλευρά, έτσι ώστε μέχρι το 1880, το Κρόουτς Εντ αναπτυσσόταν και δεν φαινόταν να υπάρχει τρόπος να αναχαιτιστεί η ροή. Δέκα χρόνια αργότερα πωλήθηκαν τα μεγάλα κτήματα του Μούσγουελ Χιλ. Το Upton Farm πωλήθηκε και οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι ήθελαν να αναπτύξουν το Churchyard Bottom Wood, που τώρα ονομάζεται Queen's Wood. Η ιστορία θα είχε κάνει ένα θεατρικό έργο του Ίψεν. Δύο ομάδες ειλικρινών, με υψηλά κίνητρα ανθρώπων που αγωνίζονται για αυτό που ο καθένας τους θεωρούσε σωστό. Οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι από τη μία και η Επιτροπή των Φιλανθρωπιών του Χόρνσεϊ από την άλλη, και οι δύο πίστευαν ότι έκαναν το καλύτερο που μπορούσαν για τους άλλους ανθρώπους, και το κοινό ξεσηκώθηκε εναντίον τους και οι δύο με αγανάκτηση.<br/><br/>Εκείνη την εποχή το Muswell Hill Road ήταν ένας επαρχιακός δρόμος, με το Southwood Hall στο ένα άκρο και το Upton Farm στο άλλο. Μέχρι το 1894, χτίστηκαν οι Κήποι του Όνσλοου, οι Κήποι Connaught ξεχώρισαν και οι οικοδόμοι ήταν έτοιμοι να αναπτύξουν το κτήμα Woodlands. Αποκομμένο από το Churchyard Bottom Wood ήταν μια ομάδα από εξοχικές κατοικίες, σε μια τριγωνική τοποθεσία. Ένας αχρονολόγητος χάρτης, που κρατήθηκε από τους Εκκλησιαστικούς Επιτρόπους δείχνει έξι Αγροτόσπιτα Wasteland με ένα άνοιγμα μεταξύ τους - όχι ένα δρόμο, όχι επιμεταλλωμένο, αλλά ένα δρόμο μέσα από τα κρεβάτια φράουλα πίσω. Πιο πέρα υπήρχε ένα άλλο κενό που οδηγούσε σε μονοπάτια μέσα από το ξύλο. Αυτά τα δύο ανοίγματα επρόκειτο να αποτελέσουν τη βάση του σχεδίου. Τα ίδια δύο κενά και το εκκαθαρισμένο έδαφος, το οποίο ήταν το πεδίο της φράουλας, φαίνονται στον παρακάτω χάρτη του 1894. Παρουσιάζονται ως 'Muswell Hill Cottages' και, αρκετά περαστικά, ο Peter Sellers επρόκειτο να ζήσει στον ίδιο χώρο πολύ αργότερα. Για να αναπτύξουν το ξύλο ως οικιστικό κτήμα, οι Επίτροποι έπρεπε να οδηγούν δύο δρόμους από την οδό Μούσγουελ Χιλ και να χτίζουν σπίτια κατά μήκος τους. Η πρόσοψη της οδού Μούσγουελ Χιλ από μόνη της δεν θα παρείχε χώρο για αρκετά σπίτια ώστε να αξίζει τον κόπο το εγχείρημα.<br/><br/>Η γη και τα αγροτόσπιτα είχαν δοθεί πολύ νωρίτερα ως ελεημοσύνες για να στεγάσουν ηλικιωμένους και κρατήθηκαν για λογαριασμό τους από τους Trustees των Επιτρόπων Φιλανθρωπίας του Hornsey. Μέχρι τη δεκαετία του 1890 τα αγροτόσπιτα ήταν υποβαθμισμένα, έχοντας ανάγκη από μεγάλες επισκευές. Δημόσιοι, θέλοντας να κάνουν το καλύτερο για τους παλιούς τους ενοίκους, οι Τραστ δεν μπορούσαν να τους βελτιώσουν αφού δεν είχαν χρήματα. Μερικά χρόνια πριν οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι σχεδίαζαν να αναπτύξουν το Gravel Pit Wood (σήμερα Highgate Wood) ως οικιστικό κτήμα, αλλά αυτό είχε συναντήσει τέτοια αντίθεση που υποχώρησαν. Αντίθετα, το 1886, έδωσαν και τα 69 στρέμματα δασικής έκτασης στο κοινό. Την ίδια στιγμή προσφέρθηκαν να πουλήσουν το Churchyard Bottom Wood στο Αστικό Επαρχιακό Συμβούλιο του Hornsey για 25.000 λίρες, αλλά αυτό ήταν πάρα πολύ για να το μεγαλώσει ο Hornsey από μόνος του. Το Συμβούλιο είπε ότι οι άνθρωποι που ζούσαν έξω από το Χόρνσεϊ απολάμβαναν επίσης το ξύλο και οι άλλες αρχές θα έπρεπε να βοηθήσουν, αλλά δεν δόθηκε βοήθεια.<br/><br/>Χάρτης που δείχνει τα σπίτια Muswell Hill Cottages τα οποία ήταν το κέντρο της διαμάχης.<br/><br/>Οδός Μούσγουελ Χιλ περίπου το 1880<br/><br/>Φαίνεται πιθανό ότι αυτά τα τρία ζευγάρια εξοχικών σπιτιών ήταν αυτά που βρίσκονταν στο επίκεντρο της διαμάχης.<br/><br/>Οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι ήθελαν να συγκεντρώσουν χρήματα για το εκκλησιαστικό της έργο στη Βρετανία και στο εξωτερικό. Θεωρούσαν ότι τους είχε δοθεί η γη για να χρησιμοποιηθεί για το προπογκάτ ιόν της θρησκείας και αν αυτό σήμαινε την πώληση γης ή δασών, ήταν μικρότερο κακό από τον περιορισμό του έργου της εκκλησίας. Είχαν δώσει το Gravel Pit Wood στο κοινό: στη θέση του θα ανέπτυσσαν το Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Οι Επιστάτες των Φιλανθρωπιών του Χόρνσεϊ ήθελαν να παράγουν ένα εισόδημα για να βοηθήσουν τους φτωχούς ανθρώπους τους, έτσι έκαναν μια προσφορά στους Επιτρόπους. Το τριγωνικό κομμάτι γης τους ήταν πολύ αμήχανα διαμορφωμένο για να αναπτυχθεί οικονομικά, αλλά αν οι Επίτροποι τους παραχωρούσαν κάποια περισσότερη γη για να την κάνουν μια τετράγωνη τοποθεσία, θα κατασκεύαζαν είκοσι πέντε τακτοποιημένες βίλες. Αυτά θα έφερναν υπόγεια ενοίκια ύψους 225 λιρών ετησίως, τα οποία θα μπορούσαν να χρησιμοποιηθούν για την ανακούφιση της φτώχειας των ανθρώπων του Hornsey.<br/><br/>Όταν έγινε γνωστή αυτή η προσφορά οι άνθρωποι αμέσως αντέδρασαν με συναγερμό.<br/><br/>Στις 16 Δεκεμβρίου 1893 ο βουλευτής Carvell Williams ζήτησε στη Βουλή των Κοινοτήτων, εάν οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι είχαν συναινέσει στην πώληση μιας λωρίδας γης στους Επιμελητές των Φιλανθρωπιών του Hornsey υπό τον όρο ότι ένας υπάρχων δρόμος θα διευρυνόταν στα 40 πόδια, αν αυτό ήταν προκαταρκτικό για ένα οικοδομικό σχήμα και αν η Βουλή του Κοινοβουλίου θα είχε την ευκαιρία να εκφράσει γνώμη.<br/><br/>Ο κ. Leveson Gower, ένας Επίτροπος Κτηματολογίου της Εκκλησίας απάντησε "Ναι" στο πρώτο μέρος.<br/><br/>Κ. Κάρβελ Γουίλιαμς, "Καταλαβαίνω ότι είναι η πρόθεση να καταστρέψουμε αυτό το τμήμα του Χάιγκεϊτ Γουντς χτίζοντας πάνω του;"<br/><br/>Δύο ημέρες αργότερα η εφημερίδα The Star δημοσίευσε ένα άρθρο αντάξιο οποιασδήποτε σύγχρονης ταμπλόιντ.<br/><br/>Το Αστέρι<br/>18 Δεκεμβρίου 1893<br/><br/>"Το Κοινοβούλιο πρέπει να προσέχει έντονα αυτούς τους παλιούς βάνδαλους και συνομοσπονδίες των τζέρι-κατασκευαστών τους Εκκλησιαστικούς Επιτρόπους, οι οποίοι αποξενώνουν πάντα κάποιο κομμάτι γης ή ευνοούν τους οικοδόμους σε αντίθεση με το ευρύ κοινό. Οι Επίτροποι δεν θα πουλούσαν τα ξύλα Churchyard Bottom στους φορολογούμενους αλλά τώρα προτείνουν "να το ανοίξουν" κόβοντας δύο ευρείες οδούς μέσα από αυτό σε σχέση με ένα από τα πολυάριθμα οικοδομικά τους σχήματα. Δεν θα θέσει κανείς ερώτηση στο Κοινοβούλιο και δεν θα ελέγξει την πολιτική τούβλων και κονιαμάτων των Επιτρόπων;»<br/><br/>Μέχρι να τυπωθεί αυτό, η ερώτηση είχε τεθεί και η απάντηση ήταν είτε αναληθής, είτε ύπουλη. Οι Times, σε μια μακρά έκθεση, ανέφεραν ότι οι Comnussioners δεν ήταν διατεθειμένοι να δώσουν μια δέσμευση ότι το Κοινοβούλιο, ή οποιοσδήποτε άλλος δημόσιος φορέας, θα πρέπει να έχει την ευκαιρία να εξετάσει οποιοδήποτε σχέδιο για την οικοδόμηση στο χώρο του ξύλου.<br/><br/>Η κατάσταση σιγοβράστηκε για δεκαοκτώ μήνες μέχρι που οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι αναγκάστηκαν να ανοίξουν μια έρευνα, η οποία ξεκίνησε στο Χάιγκεϊτ στις 31 Μαΐου 1895, υπό την προεδρία ενός Βοηθού Εκκλησιαστικού Επιτρόπου. Η Εξεταστική παρήγαγε μια πληθώρα επιστολών εφημερίδων από τις οποίες αυτό ήταν το πιο σημαντικό.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 Ιουνίου 1895<br/><br/>Ο ΒΑΝΔΑΛΙΣΜΟΣ ΣΤΗΝ ΥΨΗΛΗ<br/><br/>Κύριε –<br/><br/>Θα μας βοηθήσετε να αποκρούσουμε αυτό που θα ήταν συμφορά, όχι μόνο για την άμεση περιφέρεια, αλλά και για ολόκληρο το πυκνοκατοικημένο Βόρειο Λονδίνο; Σε κανένα μέρος της μητρόπολης ο οικοδόμος δεν υπήρξε πιο δραστήριος από ό,τι στο Crouch End και το Hornsey. Οι σωροί έρματος έχουν πάρει τη θέση των μεγαλοπρεπών φτελιών και των κάστανων, και κάποτε τα ευχάριστα χωριά μοιράζονται τη μοίρα του Στράουντ Γκριν, του Χάρριγκεϊ, του Φίνσμπερι Παρκ, του Χάιμπερι και του Ίσλινγκτον. ---<br/><br/>---- Το αντικείμενο είναι η κατασκευή δύο δρόμων σαράντα ποδών μέσα από το δάσος. Εμείς σε αυτή την περιοχή γνωρίζουμε την έννοια των δρόμων σαράντα ποδών μέσα από το δάσος. Σημαίνει ότι το δάσος είναι καταδικασμένο. Πριν από δέκα χρόνια η ταραχή έσωσε την αδελφή-ξύλο των εξήντα πέντε στρεμμάτων - το Gravel Pit Woods - και κανείς που είδε το Bank Holiday πλήθη συρρέουν μέχρι το Archway Road από τους θλιβερούς δρόμους του Holloway, Islington και Clerkenwell, και παρακολούθησε την έντονη απόλαυση των παιδιών και των οικογενειακών πάρτι πικνίκ στο γρασίδι και μεταξύ των δέντρων, θα μπορούσε να αποτύχει να συνειδητοποιήσουν την τεράστια ευεργεσία που η επιχορήγηση από το Ecces ολόκληρο το Λονδίνο έχει το Λονδίνο. ----<br/><br/>--- Οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι κατέχουν σχεδόν το ένα τρίτο της μεγάλης ενορίας του Χόρνσεϊ. Με τις φιλελεύθερες δαπάνες των χρημάτων των πληρωτών των επιτοκίων στο άνοιγμα των δρόμων και τη γενική ανάπτυξη της περιφέρειας, η αξία της περιουσίας τους έχει αυξηθεί πάρα πολύ, και από αυτή την μη κερδισμένη αύξηση αντλούν κάθε χρόνο μεγάλα έσοδα. Σίγουρα οι φορολογούμενοι των οποίων τα χρήματα έχουν βοηθήσει έτσι στη δημιουργία της τεράστιας περιουσίας μπορεί να αναμένουν φιλελεύθερη μεταχείριση σε αντάλλαγμα. ---<br/><br/>Δικός σου υπάκουος,<br/><br/>Υπογεγραμμένο από τον Εφημέριο του Αγίου Ιακώβου, τον Μούσγουελ Χιλ, τον Υπουργό του Παρεκκλησίου Παρκ, Κρούτς Εντ, έναν δικηγόρο που ζει στους Κήπους Όνσλοου και τρία μέλη του Επαρχιακού Συμβουλίου.<br/><br/>Ήταν μια βολή ακριβώς απέναντι από τα τόξα των Εκκλησιαστικών Επιτρόπων. Οι θρησκευτικοί τους ηγέτες και το Επαρχιακό Συμβούλιο, όλοι στα όπλα λέγοντας στην πραγματικότητα ότι η εκκλησία ήταν πολύ πλούσια και θα έπρεπε να είναι φιλανθρωπική, όχι άπληστη. Να θυμάστε ότι αυτό ήταν ακόμη στο απόγειο της διαμάχης του Δαρβίνου. Ο Δαρβίνος είχε διαχωρίσει την πίστη του στις διδασκαλίες της Εκκλησίας και πολλοί άνθρωποι θα δυσανασχετούσαν με τη δύναμη της Εκκλησίας από αυτή την άποψη και μόνο.<br/><br/>Τα Εβδομαδιαία Νέα, 7 Ιουνίου 1895 είπαν:-<br/><br/>"Αν οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Comnussioners δεν αντιμετωπιστούν με τη μία, το χταπόδι του κτιρίου θα πάρει μια λαβή του ξύλου η οποία θα είναι πολύ δύσκολο να χαλαρώσει αργότερα, ---. Ως εκ τούτου, επιβάλλεται στους Λονδρέζους να είναι ξύπνιοι και να κάνουν, αν θα έσωζαν ένα από τα πιο απολαυστικά τους κομμάτια από το σκουριασμένο τοπίο. Η δημόσια έρευνα αναστέλλεται για την επόμενη Πέμπτη, και πριν από αυτό πρέπει να γίνει κάτι για να πειστούν οι Επίτροποι ότι οι πολίτες του Λονδίνου δεν θα ανεχθούν τη δήμευση μιας από τις αγαπημένες τους παιδικές χαρές".<br/><br/>Ένα γράμμα στην εφημερίδα Daily Chronicle την επόμενη μέρα έλεγε:-<br/><br/>.... Ήταν με μεγάλη ανακούφιση που οι κάτοικοι, πριν από περίπου δέκα χρόνια, άκουσαν ότι είχε πραγματοποιηθεί η αγορά του Άνω Ξύλου· και πόσο ευχάριστο ευεργέτημα έχει αποδείξει αυτό, όποιος τους επισκεπτόταν μπορεί να καταθέσει, αλλά όλοι όσοι αγωνίζονταν για να σώσουν αυτά τα ανώτερα δάση, τα οποία βρίσκονται στη δυτική πλευρά του δρόμου του Μούσγουελ Χιλ, αισθάνονταν ότι η νίκη τους ήταν ημιτελής όσο τα εξήντα στρέμματα στην ανατολική πλευρά παρέμεναν σε κίνδυνο. Μπορεί κανείς να αμφιβάλλει για το ποιο θα ήταν το αποτέλεσμα αν το Ξύλο του Βυθού της Εκκλησιάς αντικαθίστατο από σειρές μικρών βιλών, που η καθεμιά τους έστελνε τη συμβολή του καπνού και της αιθάλης; Μπορεί κανείς να αμφιβάλλει, επίσης, για τη σοβαρή διαφορά που θα είχε στο γραφικό σκηνικό των ξύλων που αγοράστηκαν, αν μια γραμμή από κοιτάσματα νέων σπιτιών επρόκειτο να τρέξει ακριβώς απέναντι από τη φυλλώδη μετώπισή τους;"<br/><br/>Αυτό εξέφραζε τις απόψεις πολλών ανθρώπων. Στην πραγματικότητα, το Ξύλο του Πιτ Gravel, το οποίο ο συγγραφέας ονομάζει «Άνω Ξύλο», δεν είχε αγοραστεί, αλλά δόθηκε στην περιφέρεια από την Εκκλησιαστική Επιτροπή, ένα σημείο που έπρεπε να επαναλαμβάνουν ξανά και ξανά όλα αυτά τα χρόνια, αλλά οι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι το αγνόησαν. Η Επιτροπή δεν επρόκειτο να δώσει ούτε ένα δεύτερο ξύλο ό,τι και να πει κανείς, και κράτησε αυτή τη θέση ως το τέλος.<br/><br/>Ο Χ.Σ. Τσαμπερλέιν, από τους 5 Κήπους Κράνλεϊ, σε μια επιστολή του στους Τάιμς με ημερομηνία 8 Ιουνίου 1895, προέτρεψε την αγορά.<br/><br/>Ξέρω ότι είναι σύνηθες να μιλάμε σκληρά για τους Εκκλησιαστικούς Επιτρόπους, αλλά ως διαχειριστές ενός ταμείου είναι υποχρεωμένοι να το χορηγήσουν στο μέγιστο πλεονέκτημα, και ως εκ τούτου, αν κάτι πρέπει να γίνει για να σωθεί η κατεδάφιση του ξύλου, μου φαίνεται ότι μπορεί να πραγματοποιηθεί μόνο με την αγορά της περιουσίας από τους κομουνσιονιστές, τους οποίους γνωρίζω, είναι πλήρως ζωντανοί για την προστασία μιας μικρής εταιρείας που έχουν ήδη διαθέσει τα πεδία για τους λίγους ανθρώπους που έχουν σημασία.<br/><br/>(Αυτό αναφέρεται στα πεδία παιξίματος του Crouch End τα οποία είχαν ασφαλιστεί λίγα χρόνια αργότερα.)<br/><br/>Ως πρόεδρος της Συντηρητικής Ένωσης του Μούσγουελ Χιλ, βρίσκομαι συνεχώς σε επαφή με τους κατοίκους, και μπορώ να επιβεβαιώσω με ασφάλεια ότι κάθε άτομο που κατοικεί στη γειτονιά θα έκανε τα πάντα για να διατηρηθεί.<br/><br/>(Το μόνο που ήθελε προσωπικά ήταν το Φιλανθρωπικό εισόδημα για να συντηρήσει τους φτωχούς ανθρώπους του. Απαιτούσε το στρέμμα γης του -όχι πολύ σίγουρα- πίστευε τη διαβεβαίωση των Επιτρόπων ότι το ξύλο δεν κινδύνευε.)<br/><br/>"Ο Δρόμος του Μούσγουελ Χιλ ήταν ένας από τους καλύτερους στο Χόρνσεϊ και θα παρέμενε εξίσου όμορφος, σπίτια ή καθόλου σπίτια",<br/><br/>(και τότε ήρθε η μεγάλη ρητορική άνθηση.)<br/><br/>Οι φτωχοί πρέπει να υποφέρουν λόγω των συναισθηματικών αντιρρήσεων και της υστερικής κραυγής του 'λύκου που μόλις υψώθηκε από τους ανταποκριτές σας; Κάτι πρέπει να γίνει και ότι σύντομα. Ένα στρέμμα πίσω γης που θα προστίθετο στο φιλανθρωπικό κράτος δεν θα έκανε καμία αισθητή διαφορά στη γη που απέμεινε, ενώ το κέρδος που θα προέκυπτε από αυτό θα συνέβαλλε σε πολλά φτωχά γηραιά και άξια πρόσωπα στα φθίνοντα χρόνια τους και θα μας έδινε τη δυνατότητα να παραδώσουμε στους διαδόχους μας μια περιουσία που στο μακρινό μέλλον θα είχε μεγάλη αξία στην απόδοση φιλανθρωπικής βοήθειας στους άξιους φτωχούς της ενορίας του Hornsey'.<br/><br/>Διαβάζοντας το γράμμα του κάποιος διαισθάνεται την υστερία πολύ κοντά στην επιφάνεια. Γιατί νόμιζε ότι οι Επίτροποι ήθελαν να χτίσουν ένα δρόμο; Γιατί θα έπρεπε να ξοδέψουν όλα αυτά τα χρήματα αν όχι για να χτίσουν σπίτια; Ποτέ δεν φάνηκε να συνειδητοποιεί ότι για ένα στρέμμα γης όλο το ξύλο θα χανόταν. Ήταν το πρόσωπο στο οποίο οι Επίτροποι είχαν κάνει την προσφορά πώλησης για 25.000 λίρες πριν και είναι το όνομά του που τιμάται σε μια πλάκα στον Πύργο του Ρολογιού του Κρόουτς Εντ για τη διάσωση του ξύλου, αλλά η εμπιστοσύνη του στους Εκκλησιαστικούς Επιτρόπους φαίνεται αφελής. Είναι λυπηρό το γεγονός ότι στην Εξεταστική επρόκειτο να χυθεί ως ο διάβολος.<br/><br/>Η Εξεταστική Συνεχίστηκε<br/><br/>Η διακοπή άνοιξε στο Χάιγκεϊτ στις 15 Ιουνίου 1895. Αναμένοντας μια μεγάλη συγκέντρωση, η Αίθουσα του Συμβουλίου είχε αλλάξει εντελώς. Τα συνηθισμένα τραπέζια είχαν αφαιρεθεί και το δωμάτιο ήταν γεμάτο καρέκλες. Μέχρι τις 7:30 το δωμάτιο ήταν γεμάτο κόσμο, με τους ανθρώπους να τρέμουν για τις θέσεις.<br/><br/>Ο κ. Murray, ο Επίτροπος, είπε ότι η έρευνα ήταν πραγματικά μια απλή. Οι Hornsey Parochial Charities επιθυμούσαν να αγοράσουν ένα κομμάτι γης που να γειτνιάζει με την φιλανθρωπική τους περιουσία στο πίσω μέρος. Το ερώτημα ήταν αν η Φιλανθρωπική Επιτροπή, που έλεγχε όλες τις φιλανθρωπίες, είχε αρκετή δύναμη για να τις σταματήσει. Οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι ήταν διατεθειμένοι να πουλήσουν τη γη με πολύ ευνοϊκούς όρους και τα έσοδα της Φιλανθρωπίας θα ήταν πολύ σημαντικά αυξημένα.<br/><br/>Ενάντια σε αυτό υπήρχαν τρεις τάξεις ενστάσεων.<br/><br/>Το αρχικό Τραστ ήταν με σκοπό την παροχή εξοχικών κατοικιών για τους Φτωχούς, αλλά οι εντολοδόχοι προτείνονταν να κατασκευάσουν βίλες που θα ήταν πολύ ακριβές για τους Φτωχούς. Ωστόσο, ήταν μέσα στη δύναμη των Τραστ να διαφοροποιήσουν τους όρους του Τραστ, ώστε να μπορούν να χτίσουν βίλες αν πίστευαν ότι οι φτωχοί θα ωφελούνταν στο τέλος. Οι ίδιοι οι φτωχοί θα μπορούσαν να αντιταχθούν, αλλά είχαν ήδη υποσχεθεί για αυτούς φιλελεύθερες διατάξεις. " τρίτη ένσταση αφορούσε την αισθητική και τη δημόσια πλευρά του ζητήματος. Το πήρε από όσα είχε διαβάσει ότι η Φιλανθρωπική Επιτροπή έπρεπε να παρέμβει για να εμποδίσει τους Εκκλησιαστικούς Επιτρόπους να ασκήσουν τη δική τους διακριτική ευχέρεια στην αντιμετώπιση της δικής τους περιουσίας.<br/><br/>Η Εξεταστική συζήτησε ωραία σημεία, αλλά οι ομιλητές επέστρεφαν συνεχώς στο μεγάλο πρόβλημα της αποτροπής οποιασδήποτε καταστροφής του ξύλου. Ο Βέστρυ Κλερκ του Ίσλινγκτον, εκπροσωπώντας 300.000 άτομα, έκανε μια επίσημη διαμαρτυρία για οποιοδήποτε μέρος του ξύλου, τόσο πολύτιμη για τους ανθρώπους του Ίσλινγκτον και του Χόρνσεϊ που χρησιμοποιούνταν για ιδιωτικούς σκοπούς. Ο κ. Wilfred White δήλωσε ότι αν οι Επίτροποι τους έδιναν χρόνο θα ήταν σε θέση να συγκεντρώσουν τα χρήματα για να αποζημιώσουν τους Trustees.<br/><br/>Ο κ. Beaumont είπε ότι δεν θέλουν βίλες, ήθελαν εξοχικές κατοικίες για τους φτωχούς ανθρώπους που εκδιώκονταν από την περιοχή. Άλλοι έλεγαν ότι δεν υπήρχαν χρήματα για να χτίσουν εξοχικά σπίτια για να αντικαταστήσουν τα σημερινά χαλασμένα αλλά οι βίλες θα ήταν μια οικονομική πρόταση. Άλλοι αντήγγειλαν ότι υπήρχαν δεκάδες βίλες για να τις αφήσουν στο Χάιγκεϊτ. Το Δάσος ήταν ιερό. Μείνε στην ερώτηση του Ξύλου.<br/><br/>Ο Δρ Φλέτσερ είπε ότι η κραυγή μεταξύ των εργαζομένων ήταν ότι δεν υπήρχε πουθενά να πάει. Εργαζόμενοι άνθρωποι ήρθαν σε αυτόν με την κραυγή, "Μας διώχνουν από το Χάιγκεϊτ και είμαστε υποχρεωμένοι να πάμε στη Νέα Πόλη του Χάιγκεϊτ". Αν η πρόσοψη του δρόμου Muswell Hill πωλήθηκε δεν υπήρχε αμφιβολία αλλά ότι οι δρόμοι θα μπορούσαν να κοπούν ακριβώς μέσα από το δάσος προς την κατεύθυνση του Hornsey, αλλά αν οι Επίτροποι δεν μπορούσαν να πάρουν τη γη από την Επιτροπή Φιλανθρωπίας δεν θα μπορούσαν να κόψουν το δρόμο.<br/><br/>Ήταν πολύ σίγουρος ότι οι αγροικίες θα μπορούσαν να τεθούν σε κατάλληλη κατάσταση επισκευής. Του ζητήθηκε από τους φτωχούς ανθρώπους, από την αστυνομία και από μια σειρά από τις εργατικές τάξεις να εκπροσωπήσουν αυτά τα δύο σημεία, ότι η εξοχική κατοικία ήταν πολύ αναγκαία στο Χάιγκεϊτ και ότι αν κάποτε επέτρεπαν την πώληση της γης, δεν υπήρχε καμία ένδειξη για το πού θα έμενε το χέρι του οικοδόμου.<br/><br/>(Ζωηρές και παρατεταμένες επευφημίες).<br/><br/>Πολυάριθμοι άλλοι άνθρωποι μίλησαν και ο Κομνηνός συνόψισε λέγοντας ότι θεώρησε ότι η επικρατούσα γνώμη ήταν υπέρ της διατήρησης των εξοχικών σπιτιών αλλά η συνάντηση δεν πρέπει να βγάλει συμπεράσματα από αυτά που είχε πει (Groans).<br/><br/>Άλλοι είπαν ότι οι Εντολείς της Φιλανθρωπίας είχαν αποτύχει στα καθήκοντά τους αφήνοντας τις αγροικίες να πέσουν σε διάλυση.<br/><br/>Ο κ. H.R. Williams, ο επιστάτης που είχε γράψει στην εφημερίδα νωρίτερα, είπε ότι είχε την καλύτερη εξουσία ότι οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι δεν θα έφτιαχναν δρόμους πουθενά και δεν θα ωφελούνταν ούτε ένα γιώτα από τις ενέργειες των Φιλανθρωπικών Επιτρόπων. Άλλοι ήταν πολύ λιγότερο έμπιστοι και η συνάντηση έκλεισε μετά από σχεδόν τρεις ώρες.<br/><br/>"Βρισκόμαστε αντιμέτωποι με το γεγονός ότι στο Χάιγκεϊτ και στο Λόφο του Μούσγουελ υπάρχουν αρκετά άτομα που θέλουν το Ξύλο του Ναού και δεν θα είναι ευτυχισμένα μέχρι να το αποκτήσουν - ενώ κανείς δεν φαίνεται πρόθυμος να ξοδέψει ένα φάρσα για να το πληρώσει. Όλοι λένε ότι θα ήταν ωραίο να έχουμε το ξύλο ως ανοιχτό χώρο, αλλά όλοι πιστεύουν ότι είναι καθήκον κάποιου άλλου να το κάνει ένα. Η Islington Vestry έχει "επιλυθεί" για το θέμα, αλλά η Islington Vestry δεν προσφέρει ένα κομμάτι της δεκάρας προς την αγορά. --- Δεν υπάρχει πιο δύσκολο πρόβλημα για την κοινότητα ή το άτομο να λύσει από το πώς να αποκτήσει την κατοχή της περιουσίας των άλλων ανθρώπων χωρίς να την πληρώσει.'<br/><br/>Η πληρωμή για αυτό ήταν πράγματι το πρόβλημα καθώς το Churchyard Bottom Wood έγινε αντικείμενο έντονης τοπικής και εθνικής συζήτησης. Δημιουργήθηκε μια κοινή επιτροπή για τη συγκέντρωση χρημάτων για τη διάσωση του ξύλου. Στις 20 Νοεμβρίου 1896, C.F. Ο Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, έγραψε στο The Standard, μια καθημερινή εφημερίδα εκείνη την εποχή, ζητώντας βοήθεια. Υπενθύμισε σε όλους τον κίνδυνο να χάσουν το ξύλο και είπε ότι θα μπορούσε να σωθεί μόνο με την αγορά του. Οι Εκκλησιαστικοί Επίτροποι θα πουλούσαν για 25.000 λίρες και ένα επιπλέον (5.000 θα απαιτούνταν για ξιφασκία και αποστράγγιση, κάνοντας συνολικά 30.000 λίρες. Αυτό ήταν πάρα πολύ για να το συγκεντρώσει το Συμβούλιο του Χόρνσεϊ αλλά είχαν ήδη ψηφίσει 10.000 λίρες προς το σύνολο. Τα δάση είχαν ανεκτίμητη αξία για όλο το Βόρειο Λονδίνο και έτσι έκανε έκκληση σε δημόσιους φορείς και ιδιώτες να συγκεντρώσουν τις υπόλοιπες 20.000 λίρες. προειδοποίησε ότι η παρούσα προσφορά από τους Επιτρόπους της Εκκλησίας ήταν ανοιχτή μόνο μέχρι το τέλος του 1898. Μετά από αυτό οι οικοδόμοι θα μετακινούνταν.<br/><br/>Η έφεση χαιρετίστηκε θερμά από τον Τύπο. Ένα Ιδιωτικό Νομοσχέδιο πέρασε εσπευσμένα από το Κοινοβούλιο και ο νόμος Highgate Woods Preservation Act του 1897, έγινε νόμος. Η Conunitee είχε πλέον το δικαίωμα να διαφημίζει για συνεισφορές προς την αγορά του Ξύλου και τη διατήρησή του.<br/><br/>Σε αρκετά σύντομο χρονικό διάστημα συγκεντρώθηκαν σχεδόν όλα τα χρήματα, αλλά οι τελευταίες λίγες χιλιάδες αποδείχθηκαν πολύ δύσκολο να συγκεντρωθούν και η προθεσμία των Επιτρόπων ήταν θέμα εβδομάδων. Ο κ. Cory-Wright έγραψε παρακλήσεις για περισσότερο χρόνο αλλά του παραχωρήθηκε μόνο τρεις μήνες και στη συνέχεια μόνο αν πληρωνόταν τόκος στο 4 τοις εκατό για την επιπλέον περίοδο επί του πλήρους ποσού. Στο τέλος το Συμβούλιο της Κομητείας του Λονδίνου, το οποίο αρχικά είχε προσφέρει 2.500 λίρες, το έκανε αυτό μέχρι 5.000 λίρες και το σύνολο επιτεύχθηκε, αλλά ήταν κάτι κοντινό.<br/><br/>Το Συμβούλιο αποφάσισε να μετονομάσει το Ξύλο σε 'Κουίνς Γουντς' προς τιμήν του Διαμαντένιου Ιωβηλαίου της Βασίλισσας Βικτωρίας και ο Χόρνσεϊ έβαλε μια ωραία επίδειξη του bunting όταν η Δούκισσα του Όλμπανι κήρυξε επίσημα το Ξύλο ανοικτό 'για την ελεύθερη χρήση του κοινού για πάντα'.<br/><br/>Ενώ η εκστρατεία για τη διάσωση του Churchyard Bottom Wood διοικήθηκε και σκηνοθετήθηκε από ντόπιους που ένιωθαν με πάθος για αυτό το συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι του δάσους, κάλεσαν τη βοήθεια και την εμπειρία ενός τεράστιου δικτύου ανθρώπων, μερικοί από τους οποίους είχαν συνεργαστεί σε παρόμοιες εκστρατείες για πάνω από τριάντα χρόνια. Η επιτροπή εξέδωσε έφεση, τυπωμένη σε χαρτί πολύ καλής ποιότητας και φέρει μερικά διάσημα ονόματα.<br/><br/>Τα ερωτήματα του ανοιχτού χώρου και της δημόσιας υγείας ήταν μείζονα θέματα του βικτωριανού οράματος.<br/><br/>Το Κίνημα Ανοιχτών Χώρων<br/><br/>Ο Οκτάβια Χιλ, ο μεγάλος μεταρρυθμιστής κατοικιών, ο οποίος είχε ξεκινήσει με τρία παλιά σπίτια στο Μέριλεμπον, που αγοράστηκε γι' αυτήν από τον Ζολμ Ράσκιν, είχε γίνει γρήγορα ειδικός για τη στέγαση των φτωχών ανθρώπων στις πιο υγιεινές συνθήκες. Ο τρόπος της ήταν να αγοράσει μισθώσεις και στη συνέχεια να γκρεμίσει μερικά από τα πολυσύχναστα σπίτια προκειμένου να φέρει φως και αέρα στα υπόλοιπα, πιστεύοντας ότι ο καθαρός αέρας και το φως του ήλιου ήταν ο μόνος τρόπος που οι φτωχοί άνθρωποι θα μπορούσαν να σωθούν από τον 'κουρασμένο πυρετό. Το είχε μάθει αυτό όταν ήταν παιδί από τον παππού της, Σάουθγουντ Σμιθ, ο οποίος ανέπτυξε τις θεωρίες του στο Νοσοκομείο Πυρετού στο Κινγκς Κρος.<br/><br/>Είχε κατασκευάσει τις πρώτες Βιομηχανικές Κατοικίες για φτωχούς ανθρώπους και είχε αποδείξει στατιστικά ότι ο καλός αέρας και η αξιοπρεπής αποστράγγιση έσωσαν ζωές. Οι Κήποι Γκίμπσον, στο Northwold Road, είναι άμεσο αποτέλεσμα των ιδεών του Σάουθγουντ Σμιθ.<br/><br/>Η Σημασία του Ανοιχτού Αέρα<br/><br/>Οι ανοιχτοί χώροι και η ευκαιρία να αναπνεύσουν καθαρό αέρα, ήταν απαραίτητοι για τους ανθρώπους που ζούσαν σε ένα ή δύο πολυσύχναστα δωμάτια. Αγαπούσε τόσο πολύ τα χωράφια της λεωφόρου Φιτζζόν ώστε προσπάθησε να τα αγοράσει ως δημόσιο πάρκο. Χρειαζόταν μόνο το τέλος των καλοκαιρινών διακοπών και την επιστροφή από τις διακοπές των συμπονετικών φίλων και οι επιπλέον 1.500 λίρες θα είχαν αυξηθεί, αλλά οι ιδιοκτήτες ξαφνικά απέσυραν την προσφορά τους.<br/><br/>Από αυτό αναπτύχθηκε η εκστρατεία για τη διάσωση του Parliament Hill, του επόμενου ανοιχτού χώρου προς τα βόρεια από το Lisson Grove, αγοράζοντας χωράφια στο δρόμο των οικοδόμων για να φτιάξουν ένα μόνιμο cordon sanitalre ενάντια στα προελαύνοντα τούβλα. Η εκστρατεία του Κοινοβουλίου Χιλ Φιλντς ήταν τόσο επιτυχής που ψηφίστηκε το νομοσχέδιο Hampstead Heath και υπήρχαν χρήματα πάνω από την έκκληση. Από αυτά τα χρήματα και την ώθηση προς τους ανοιχτούς χώρους, ήταν η ανάπτυξη του Εθνικού Καταπιστεύματος. Η Octavia Hill ενδιαφερόταν για την προστασία περιοχών όπως το Church Bottom Wood για χρόνια, οπότε ήταν φυσική σύμμαχος στον αγώνα για τη διάσωση του Ξύλου.<br/><br/>Η Εταιρεία Συντήρησης των Κοινών επίσης, ήταν εξοικειωμένη με αυτό το είδος ταραχής και συλλογής χρημάτων. Είχαν γκρεμίσει την ξιφασκία όταν οι άρχοντες της έπαυλης είχαν περιφραγμένα κομμάτια κοινής γης, οδηγώντας τόσο νομικές όσο και παράνομες μάχες ενάντια στην αλαζονική ιδιωτικοποίηση της γης παραδοσιακά ελεύθερη. Ο Ρόμπερτ Χάντερ, ο Επίτιμος Δικηγόρος τους από το 1868, ενδιαφερόταν πάντα για την εξασφάλιση ανοιχτών χώρων, μεγάλων ή μικρών, για το κοινό. Πρόεδρος της Εταιρείας Διατήρησης των Κοινών ήταν ο κ. Shaw-Lefevre βουλευτής (αργότερα Λόρδος Eversley) ο οποίος έπαιξε μεγάλο ρόλο σε αυτή και σε άλλες εκστρατείες στη Βουλή των Κοινοτήτων.<br/><br/>Την ίδια στιγμή η Οκταβία Χιλ έκανε εκστρατεία για ένα νομοσχέδιο για ταφή.<br/><br/>Οι εκκλησιές της πόλης είχαν γίνει τόσο γεμάτες και τόσο σοβαρός κίνδυνος για την υγεία, μολύνοντας πηγάδια από τα οποία οι άνθρωποι έβγαζαν το πόσιμο νερό τους, ώστε οι ταφές της πόλης δεν επιτρεπόταν πλέον. Το νεκροταφείο του Άμπνεϊ Παρκ ήταν ένα από αυτά. Υπήρχε τότε μια κίνηση για να αφαιρεθούν οι ταφόπλακες στις άκρες των κειμηλίων της παλιάς πόλης, να επανενταχθούν τα πτώματα αλλού και να μετατραπούν οι κητείες σε κήπους και ανοιχτούς χώρους, αντί να χτιστούν πάνω τους. Αυτή η γη στο κέντρο του Λονδίνου ήταν πολύ πολύτιμη και οι κερδοσκόποι ήταν άπληστοι για να την αποκτήσουν: Ακόμη και οι Κουάκεροι είχαν χτίσει πάνω από μία από τις κητείες τους και απειλούσαν να το κάνουν ξανά χτίζοντας πάνω από τα χωράφια του Μπάνχιλ. Η Οκτάβια Χιλ είχε ένα δίκτυο συμμάχων σε μια ντουζίνα χωράφια, οπότε η βοήθειά της για να σώσει την Εκκλησία του Κάτω Ξύλου πρέπει να ήταν ανεκτίμητη.<br/><br/>Η Μητροπολιτική Εταιρία Κήπων, που ιδρύθηκε το 1882, είχε δημιουργήσει περίπου διακόσιους μικρούς κήπους στα κέντρα των πόλεων μέχρι το 1890.<br/><br/>Η Kyrle Society έχει πλέον ξεχαστεί, αλλά στην εποχή της είχε μεγάλη επιρροή στη νομοθεσία Πολεοδομίας και Ανοικτού Χώρου. Η Εταιρεία είχε συσταθεί περίπου το 1875 για «τη Διάχυση της Ομορφιάς», για να φέρει το χρώμα και το ενδιαφέρον στη ζωή των ανθρώπων που ζουν σε θαμπό, ζοφερό περιβάλλον. φωτεινό χρώμα στους τοίχους και τη διακόσμηση, καλό τραγούδι, ανοιχτούς χώρους, Φύση, Λογοτεχνία και Τέχνη. Όλα αυτά περιήλθαν στην αρμοδιότητα της Εταιρίας. Υπήρχε ένας Διακοσμητικός Κλάδος, για τον οποίο δίδασκε ο Γουίλιαμ Μόρις· ένας Μουσικός Κλάδος για την προώθηση χορωδιών και Ευτυχισμένων Βραδυνών για τους ανθρώπους στα τοπικά σχολικά κτίρια· και ένας Κλάδος Λογοτεχνίας. Η Εταιρία έκανε τακτικά έκκληση με επιστολές της στην εφημερίδα The Times, στις «πλουσιότερες τάξεις» για να διανεμηθούν βιβλία και περιοδικά σε κλαμπ αγοριών και κοριτσιών, σε ελεημοσύνες και αλλού. Το ίδιο το όνομα «Κυρλ» προήλθε από τον «Άνθρωπο του Ρος» του Πάπα, τον φιλάνθρωπο που έδωσε τη γενέτειρά του στο λαό ως δημόσιο πάρκο. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Με την Ημέρα των Ευχαριστιών στη γωνία, εδώ είναι μερικά γιορτινά παιχνίδια φακέλων που φτιάξαμε για τα κορίτσια και τα δύο παιχνίδια Ευχαριστιών επικεντρώνονται στις μαθηματικές ικανότητες και είμαι ευγνώμων για άλλη μια φορά στον σύζυγό μου, Εντ, που έφτιαξε όλα τα clipart για μένα.<br/><br/>Ημέρα των Ευχαριστιών Pattern Making<br/><br/>Όπως λέει και το όνομα, αυτό το παιχνίδι έχει να κάνει με την κατασκευή μοτίβων. Τα μικρά που μόλις μαθαίνουν για τα μοτίβα, μπορούν απλά να ταιριάξουν τις εικόνες πάνω στις λωρίδες μοτίβου, ενώ άλλα μπορούν να συνεχίσουν το μοτίβο με τις κάρτες εικόνας στις κενές λωρίδες.<br/><br/>Για να κάνετε το φάκελο του αρχείου, θέλετε να κόψετε το πλέγμα των εικόνων για να κάνετε τα κομμάτια της κάρτας. Σας συνιστώ να τα πλαστικοποιήσετε για να διαρκέσουν περισσότερο. Στη συνέχεια, κολλήστε τις λωρίδες μοτίβου κάτω στο φάκελο του αρχείου.<br/><br/>Ήθελα να έχω και τις λευκές λωρίδες των μοτίβων έτσι ώστε τα κορίτσια να μπορούν να δουν πού να συνεχίσουν το μοτίβο και πόσα να απλώσουν. Τις προσάρτησα στο πλάι του φακέλου χρησιμοποιώντας ταινία ώστε να μπορούν να διπλώσουν για να μαζέψουν το παιχνίδι και να επεκταθούν στη διάταξη του μοτίβου.<br/><br/>Πρόσθεσα επίσης ένα επιπλέον κενό ώστε τα κορίτσια να μπορούν να φτιάξουν και το δικό τους μοτίβο.<br/><br/>Τουρκία Αριθμός παιχνιδιού<br/><br/>Σε αυτό το παιχνίδι τα κορίτσια προσθέτουν τα φτερά στο σώμα της γαλοπούλας ενώ ασκούν την καταμέτρηση και την αναγνώριση αριθμών. Χρησιμοποιούσα τα άχρωμα φτερά για να λειτουργήσω ως οδηγός για το πού να προσθέσω τα φτερά και έτσι ώστε τα κορίτσια να μπορούν να ταιριάζουν με τους αριθμούς. Και να είστε βέβαιος όταν κολλάτε κάτω από το σώμα της γαλοπούλας κολλάτε μόνο στο κέντρο έτσι ώστε τα κομμάτια των φτερών να μπορούν να γλιστρήσουν κάτω από το σώμα.<br/><br/>Μόλις τοποθετηθούν όλα τα φτερά, εξασκούμαστε σε κάποια απλή αριθμητική, όπως να αφαιρέσουμε τρία φτερά και να δούμε πόσα απέμειναν στη συνέχεια να προσθέσουμε δύο πίσω για να δούμε τι ισούται.<br/><br/>Εκτός από τις ασπρόμαυρες πτέρυγες, συμπεριλάβαμε και μια άχρωμη γαλοπούλα σε περίπτωση που θέλετε τα μικρά να χρωματίσουν το δικό τους σετ. Αντί για ένα παιχνίδι φακέλων αρχείων μπορείτε να μετατρέψετε αυτό σε ένα σκάφος, χρωματίζοντας τα κομμάτια, κόβοντάς τα έξω, και κολλώντας τα μαζί.<br/><br/>Μια άλλη επιλογή είναι να χρησιμοποιήσουμε τα κομμάτια για να φτιάξουμε μια ιστορία με τσόχα.<br/><br/>Έτσι:<br/><br/>Ποιος είμαι;<br/><br/>Νομίζω ότι εδώ πρέπει να πω κάτι πνευματώδες για τον εαυτό μου... είμαι μητέρα που μένει σπίτι σε τρία φοβερά παιδιά... τις δίδυμες κόρες μας που είναι επτά τώρα και ένα δίχρονο γιο που είναι γεμάτος ενέργεια. Στην προ-παιδική μου ζωή ήμουν δάσκαλος και τώρα homeschool τα παιδιά μας. Είμαι επίσης παντρεμένος με τον Εντ, ο οποίος υπηρετεί σήμερα στην Πολεμική Αεροπορία, και είναι ο έρωτας της ζωής μου (θα ήταν αμήχανο αν δεν ήταν).

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Η χρήση αλκοόλ από άτομα κάτω των 21 ετών έχει αναγνωριστεί ως μεγάλο πρόβλημα δημόσιας υγείας. Μελέτες σημειώνουν ότι αυξάνει τους κινδύνους για αναπηρία, και μπορεί να είναι επιζήμια για τον αναπτυσσόμενο εγκέφαλο. Οι ανήλικοι που πίνουν έχουν περισσότερες πιθανότητες να αυτοκτονήσουν, να παραβούν το νόμο ή να πέσουν θύματα βίας. Το αλκοόλ εμπλέκεται σχεδόν στο ένα τρίτο των θανάτων από τροχαία ατυχήματα των νέων. Το συνολικό ετήσιο κόστος της κατανάλωσης αλκοόλ από ανηλίκους εκτιμάται σε 62 δισεκατομμύρια δολάρια. Ενώ οι περισσότεροι νόμοι που αποσκοπούν στην πρόληψη της κατανάλωσης αλκοόλ από ανηλίκους ψηφίζονται σε πολιτειακό επίπεδο, υπήρξε νομοθετική δραστηριότητα και ενδιαφέρον σε ομοσπονδιακό επίπεδο για την υποστήριξη των προσπαθειών των κρατών να περιορίσουν το πρόβλημα. Αυτή η έκθεση περιγράφει την έκταση της χρήσης αλκοόλ από ανηλίκους, την πρόσφατη νομοθετική δραστηριότητα σχετικά με αυτό το θέμα, και τις διάφορες επιπτώσεις της πολιτικής. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Δεν ήταν η πολιτική άσκηση πίεσης ή οι δημόσιες αναφορές που είχαν ως αποτέλεσμα τη μεταρρύθμιση των τροφίμων, αλλά μάλλον μια λαϊκή προσπάθεια με επικεφαλής τους πολίτες με την εξουσία να υλοποιούν πραγματικά και να ακολουθούν με την αλλαγή.<br/><br/>Τέλειωσα τη δημοσίευση που αναφέρεται σε ένα ερώτημα: Γιατί είναι τόσο δύσκολο για εμάς να το κάνουμε αυτό μόνοι μας, ως άτομα; Αν μια ολόκληρη χώρα μπορεί να εφαρμόσει και να διαδώσει μια κοινή άποψη για το φαγητό, γιατί δεν μπορούμε εμείς;<br/><br/>Δεν υπάρχει τίποτα που να μας εμποδίζει να μιμηθούμε την επιτυχία της Δανίας Το πρόβλημα είναι ότι κατακλυζόμαστε με τόσα μηνύματα για το τι πρέπει να τρώμε, και πώς πρέπει να ζούμε, είναι δύσκολο να ξέρουμε από πού να ξεκινήσουμε. Έτσι, αντί να ακολουθούν επιτυχημένα πλαίσια που έχουν αποδειχθεί ότι λειτουργούν (όπως το Nordic Food Manifesto), οι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι πηδούν από τη τρέλα της διατροφής στη τρέλα της διατροφής, προσπαθώντας να βρουν τον "σωστό τρόπο να φάνε".<br/><br/>Αλλά πώς τα κατάφερε ο Claus Meyer; Ποια ήταν η μυστική σάλτσα που βοήθησε το Μανιφέστο να κρατηθεί; Και είναι λογικό να πιστεύουμε ότι μπορούμε να εφαρμόσουμε αυτά τα μαθήματα στη δική μας ζωή; Continue reading<br/><br/>Μοιράσου αυτό:<br/><br/>Το μαχαίρι μου βυθίστηκε στο βοδινό κρέας με μια ηχητική κρίση, ποπ, και κοσκίνισμα.<br/><br/>"Γουόααα!"<br/><br/>Κοίταξα την αδελφή μου καθώς και οι δύο γελούσαμε έκπληκτοι, και συνέχισα να χαμογελώ καθώς τελείωνα το πρώτο μου δάγκωμα. Η μοναδική εξωτερική τραγανότητα του κρέατος έδωσε τη θέση της σε ένα απόλυτα ζουμερό εσωτερικό, με αποτέλεσμα έναν ήχο που μοιάζει περισσότερο με το τεμαχισμό σε καλτσόνε παρά με αλεσμένο μοσχαρίσιο κρέας.<br/><br/>Καθόμασταν στην παλαιότερη παμπ της Κοπεγχάγης, που έμοιαζε περισσότερο με ένα περιστασιακό μπιστρό παρά με ένα μπαρ, και ετοιμαζόμουν να δοκιμάσω το πιάτο που συνέστησε η σερβιτόρα μας/μπαρ τρυφερή/ιδιοκτήτρια;<br/><br/>"Το βόειο κρέας του Παρισιού, είναι πολύ καλό", είχε πει. "Δεν είναι από τη Γαλλία... είναι πολύ δανικό".<br/><br/>Υπογράψτε με!<br/><br/>Βόειο κρέας του Παρισιού με φρέσκα λαχανικά και ωμό κρόκο αυγού στο Rabes Have in Copenhagen |
