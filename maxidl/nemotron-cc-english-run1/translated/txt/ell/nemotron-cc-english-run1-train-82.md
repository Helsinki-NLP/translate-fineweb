In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Διαδικτυακό CPR Certification Blog<br/><br/>Ημερομηνία: 23 Ιουλίου 2014<br/><br/>Η αυτοσωμική κυρίαρχη διάμεση νεφρική νόσος είναι μια σπάνια συλλογή ασθενειών που επηρεάζουν τις γνωστές λειτουργίες του νεφρού.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes' vs. Λοκ's Account on the State of Nature (Ο λογαριασμός του Χόμπς εναντίον Λοκ για την κατάσταση της φύσης)<br/><br/>Θέμα: ΦιλοσοφίαΛόγια: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Ο Χομπς και ο Λοκ είναι από τους πιο επιδραστικούς πολιτικούς φιλοσόφους που έγραψαν ποτέ στα αγγλικά. Η κατάσταση της φύσης, η οποία προηγείται της οργάνωσης των πολύπλοκων κοινωνιών, είναι η κοινή παραδοχή ότι τόσο ο Χομπς όσο και ο Λοκ μοιράζονται αλλά ερμηνεύουν με διαφορετικούς τρόπους. Οι πρώτοι θεωρούν τους ανθρώπους στη φυσική τους κατάσταση εξίσου επικίνδυνους και ελεύθερους να επιδιώξουν τους εγωιστικούς τους στόχους χωρίς περιορισμούς από τις ανύπαρκτες αντιλήψεις περί δικαιοσύνης, γι' αυτό και η φυσική του κατάσταση ισοδυναμεί με τον "πόλεμο κάθε ανθρώπου εναντίον κάθε ανθρώπου" (Hobbes76). Ο τελευταίος, από την άλλη πλευρά, θεωρεί τους ανθρώπους στην αρχική τους κατάσταση εξίσου πολύτιμους και περιορίζει τη φυσική ελευθερία με την ιδέα της δικαιοσύνης που απαιτεί να μην βλάπτουν τους άλλους, γεγονός που επιτρέπει τον ορισμό της κατάστασης της φύσης ως "αμοιβαία βοήθεια και διατήρηση" και όχι πόλεμο (Locke 15). Η βασική διαφορά μεταξύ των αφηγήσεων των δύο φιλοσόφων για τη φυσική κατάσταση είναι ότι ο Λοκ χρησιμοποιεί ηθικούς συλλογισμούς ενώ ο Χομπς όχι, και τελικά οδηγεί τον Χομπς να οραματιστεί ένα κράτος που ασκεί απεριόριστη εξουσία στα ανθρώπινα όντα, ενώ ο Λοκ περιορίζει την κυβέρνηση από τις ηθικές αρχές, τις οποίες θεωρεί φυσικό νόμο.<br/><br/>Ο Χομπς βασίζει τις υποθέσεις του σχετικά με την κατάσταση της φύσης στο γεγονός ότι όλοι οι άνθρωποι είναι περίπου ίσοι στις σωματικές και διανοητικές τους ικανότητες. Παραδέχεται ότι μερικά άτομα μπορεί να επιδείξουν μεγαλύτερη σωματική δύναμη ή ανώτερη διανόηση αλλά επιμένει ότι "όταν όλα υπολογίζονται μαζί, η διαφορά μεταξύ ανθρώπου και ανθρώπου δεν είναι τόσο σημαντική" (Hobbes 74). Δεδομένου ότι οι άνθρωποι είναι περίπου ίσοι στις δυνατότητές τους, έχουν επίσης παρόμοιες ελπίδες να επιτύχουν τους σκοπούς τους και να ικανοποιήσουν τις ανάγκες τους (Hobbes 75). Ως λογικό αποτέλεσμα αυτής της ισότητας, όταν οι άνθρωποι αρχίζουν να ανταγωνίζονται για σπάνιους πόρους, κανείς δεν μπορεί να αισθάνεται απόλυτα ασφαλής στις κτήσεις του. Ακόμα κι αν ένα ισχυρό, πονηρό και ικανό άτομο καταφέρει να υποτάξει «τα πρόσωπα όλων των ανθρώπων που μπορεί», δεν εγγυάται ακόμα την απόλυτη ασφάλεια (Hobbes 75). Καθώς κανένας άνθρωπος δεν μπορεί να αποκτήσει τέτοια υπεροχή έναντι των άλλων που να καθιστά αυτόν ή αυτήν εντελώς απρόσβλητο από τη δύναμη της διανόησης τους, κανένας άνθρωπος δεν μπορεί να αισθάνεται απόλυτα ασφαλής όταν περιβάλλεται από τους ίσους του. Η ισότητα του Χομπς στη φυσική κατάσταση είναι η ισότητα του φόβου, όπου όλοι οι άνθρωποι βλέπουν ο ένας τον άλλον ως επικίνδυνους ανταγωνιστές.<br/><br/>Ακριβώς όπως ο Χομπς, ο Λοκ θεωρεί ότι όλα τα ανθρώπινα όντα είναι θεμελιωδώς ίσα, αλλά εκχωρεί ένα πολύ διαφορετικό νόημα στον όρο. Από την πλευρά του, δεν είναι η ισότητα των δυνατοτήτων, αλλά, μάλλον, η ισότητα της αξίας. Ο ίδιος οραματίζεται ότι οι άνθρωποι που «γεννιούνται ακατάπαυστα σε όλα τα ίδια πλεονεκτήματα της φύσης» θα πρέπει λογικά να απολαμβάνουν την τέλεια ισότητα μεταξύ τους, καθώς δεν υπάρχει κανένας λόγος να θεωρούν κάποιον εγγενώς πιο πολύτιμο (Locke 8). Το μόνο πιθανό θεμέλιο για τον ορισμό κάποιων ανθρώπων ως ανώτερων από άλλους θα ήταν αν ο Θεός «με οποιαδήποτε έκδηλη διακήρυξη του θελήματός του, έβαζε τον έναν πάνω από τον άλλον» (Locke 8). Εφόσον απουσιάζουν τέτοιες θεϊκές κυρώσεις ανωτερότητας, ο Λοκ συμπεραίνει ότι η φυσική ισότητα όλων των εκπροσώπων της ανθρωπότητας δεν πρέπει να αμφισβητηθεί. Ο Χομπς προσεγγίζει την ισότητα πραγματιστικά και τονίζει ότι οι άνθρωποι στη φυσική τους κατάσταση είναι εξίσου επικίνδυνοι, αλλά ο Λοκ υιοθετεί μια ηθική προσέγγιση και τονίζει ότι οι άνθρωποι είναι εξίσου πολύτιμοι στα μάτια του Θεού. Αυτή η διαφωνία δεν είναι παρά η πρώτη διαφορά μεταξύ των δύο συγγραφέων με βάση το γεγονός ότι ο Λοκ περιλαμβάνει τον Θεό ως προϋπόθεση στην πολιτική του φιλοσοφία, ενώ ο Χομπς δεν το κάνει.<br/><br/>Ένα άλλο χαρακτηριστικό γνώρισμα της αφήγησης του Χομπς για τη φυσική κατάσταση είναι η ερμηνεία του για την ελευθερία. Σύμφωνα με τον Χομπς, η κατάσταση της φύσης συνεπάγεται απεριόριστη ελευθερία να κάνει κανείς ό,τι είναι απαραίτητο για τη συνέχιση της ύπαρξής του. Ο φιλόσοφος ορίζει την ελευθερία ως «την απουσία εξωτερικών εμποδίων» στη χρήση των ικανοτήτων κάποιου για την επίτευξη των στόχων του (Hobbes 79). Ο πρωταρχικός σκοπός κάθε αισθανόμενου όντος είναι η διατήρηση της συνεχιζόμενης ύπαρξής του. Ως συνέπεια, η Χομπεσιανή ελευθερία ισοδυναμεί με την ανεμπόδιστη ευκαιρία να κάνει κανείς οτιδήποτε που, κατά την κρίση του, θα ήταν καταλληλότερο για να διατηρήσει τη ζωή και τις κτήσεις του (Hobbes 79). Ο μόνος περιορισμός στην ελευθερία είναι ότι ένα άτομο δεν μπορεί να κάνει τίποτα αντιφατικό για να συντηρήσει τη ζωή του ή να καταστρέψει "τα μέσα διατήρησης του ίδιου" (Hobbes 79). Εκτός από αυτό, δεν υπάρχουν όρια, και ο καθένας έχει «δικαίωμα στα πάντα, ακόμη και στο σώμα του άλλου» αν αυτό προάγει την επιβίωση κάποιου (Hobbes 80). Έτσι, η φυσική ελευθερία, όπως την βλέπει ο Χομπς, είναι η απουσία εξωτερικά επιβαλλόμενων εμποδίων στην επιδίωξη του δικαιώματος κάποιου στο καθετί να συντηρεί και να εξασφαλίζει τη συνεχή ύπαρξη του.<br/><br/>Ο Λοκ υποστηρίζει επίσης την ιδέα της φυσικής ελευθερίας αλλά, όπως ήταν αναμενόμενο, την προσεγγίζει με τρόπο που είναι σημαντικά διαφορετικός από αυτόν του Χομπς. Μόλις αρχίζει να συζητά για την ελευθερία στην κατάσταση της φύσης, αμέσως σημειώνει ότι μια κατάσταση ελευθερίας δεν εξισώνει "μια κατάσταση άδειας" (Locke 9). Ο φιλόσοφος προσδιορίζει δύο συγκεκριμένους περιορισμούς στην ανθρώπινη ελευθερία στην κατάσταση της φύσης. Ο πρώτος είναι πανομοιότυπος με εκείνον που εισήγαγε ο Χομπς: όσο ελεύθερος και ανεξάρτητος και αν είναι, ένα άτομο ωστόσο «δεν έχει την ελευθερία να καταστρέψει τον εαυτό του» (Locke 9). Ωστόσο ο δεύτερος περιορισμός έρχεται σε άμεση αντίθεση με τις προθέσεις του Χομπς. Σύμφωνα με τον Λοκ, κάθε ανθρώπινο ον έχει μια φυσική υποχρέωση να μην "βλάψει άλλον στη ζωή, την υγεία, την ελευθερία ή τα υπάρχοντά του" (9). Όπως ακριβώς και με την ερμηνεία του για την ισότητα, ο συγγραφέας βασίζει αυτόν τον ισχυρισμό σε ηθικούς και θρησκευτικούς λόγους: οι άνθρωποι πρέπει να διατηρούν ο ένας την ύπαρξη του άλλου αφού είναι όλοι δημιουργήματα του ίδιου "ανίκανου, και απείρως σοφού δημιουργού" (Locke 9). Έτσι, ο Λοκ περιορίζει την ελευθερία στη φυσική κατάσταση πολύ πιο αυστηρά από τον Χομπς εισάγοντας την υποχρέωση να απέχει από το να βλάψει τόσο τον εαυτό του όσο και τους άλλους.<br/><br/>Οι διαφορές μεταξύ των δύο συγγραφέων εκδηλώνονται επίσης στις αφηγήσεις τους για τη δικαιοσύνη στη φυσική κατάσταση της ανθρωπότητας. Όσον αφορά τον Χομπς, η οριοθέτηση δίκαιων και άδικων πρακτικών είναι απλώς θέμα του νόμου. Δεν υπάρχει νομολογία στην κατάσταση της φύσης, και ο μόνος νόμος που διέπει τα ανθρώπινα όντα στην αρχική τους κατάσταση είναι ένας φυσικός νόμος που τους υποχρεώνει μόνο να αναζητούν προσωπική ασφάλεια. Ως αποτέλεσμα, τίποτα δεν μπορεί να είναι άδικο στην αρχική κατάσταση του ανθρώπινου γένους: "ονόματα ορθής και εσφαλμένης δικαιοσύνης και αδικίας" δεν έχουν θέση και νόημα ελλείψει του αυστηρά επιβαλλόμενου νόμου (Hobbes 78). Όσο οι άνθρωποι χρησιμοποιούν την ουσιαστικά απεριόριστη ελευθερία τους για να ανταγωνίζονται ανελέητα ο ένας τον άλλον για πόρους, στους οποίους δικαιούνται εξίσου, δεν έχουν κριτήρια για να διαφοροποιούν τις δίκαιες και τις άδικες πράξεις. Ως εκ τούτου, η Χομπεσιανή κατάσταση της φύσης αψηφά την ίδια την ιδέα της δικαιοσύνης αφού ο συγγραφέας την ερμηνεύει ως απλή λειτουργία του επισημοποιημένου και καθιερωμένου νόμου.<br/><br/>Ο Λοκ αποδίδει διαφορετικό νόημα στη δικαιοσύνη και τη θεωρεί όχι τόσο νομοθετική όσο από ηθική άποψη. Αυτή η εργασία ανέφερε ήδη ότι, σε αντίθεση με τον Χομπς, ο Λοκ χρησιμοποιεί ηθικές αντιλήψεις και γενικά βασίζει την πολιτική του φιλοσοφία σε ηθικά και όχι καθαρά πρακτικά τεκμήρια. Ο φυσικός νόμος του Λοκ, σε αντίθεση με αυτόν του Χομπς, υποχρεώνει τους ανθρώπους να φροντίζουν ο ένας τον άλλον αντί απλά να αφήνουν τον καθένα να φροντίσει τον εαυτό του. Ο συγγραφέας επισημαίνει ο ίδιος το γεγονός αυτό όταν παρατηρεί ότι κανείς δεν πρέπει να στερεί από κάποιον άλλον τη ζωή του τα μέσα για τη διατήρησή της «εκτός αν πρόκειται να αποδοθεί δικαιοσύνη σε έναν παραβάτη» (Locke 9). Αυτή η δήλωση αποκαλύπτει με τη μέγιστη σαφήνεια ότι, σύμφωνα με τον Λοκ, υπάρχει δικαιοσύνη στην κατάσταση της φύσης, και, επιπλέον, οι άνθρωποι πρέπει να τη διατηρήσουν ενεργά. Το κριτήριο της δικαιοσύνης, το οποίο στερείται η φυσική κατάσταση του Χομπς, είναι ο δεύτερος περιορισμός της φυσικής ελευθερίας που επιβάλλει ο Λοκ: μια πράξη είναι άδικη αν συνιστά αδικαιολόγητη απειλή για τη ζωή και τις κτήσεις ενός άλλου ατόμου.<br/><br/>Αυτές οι διαφορές στη μεταχείριση των δύο συγγραφέων για την ισότητα, την ελευθερία και τη δικαιοσύνη ή την αδικία κορυφώνονται με την ερμηνεία τους για τη σχέση μεταξύ της κατάστασης της φύσης και της κατάστασης του πολέμου. Από την πλευρά του Χομπς, τα δύο είναι συνώνυμα, επειδή ο αδίστακτος ανταγωνισμός είναι το μόνο λογικό αποτέλεσμα της τοποθέτησης ανθρώπων με ισοδύναμες δυνατότητες και παρόμοιες ανάγκες σε ένα περιβάλλον με περιορισμένους πόρους. Δηλώνει αυτή τη σύνδεση απερίφραστα: «αν δύο άνθρωποι επιθυμούν το ίδιο πράγμα, το οποίο παρ' όλα αυτά δεν μπορούν να απολαύσουν και οι δύο, γίνονται εχθροί» και είναι, ως εκ τούτου, σε εμπόλεμη κατάσταση μεταξύ τους (Hobbes 75). Ωστόσο, εφόσον οι άνθρωποι είναι πολυάριθμοι και όλοι κατέχουν παρόμοιες δυνατότητες και ανάγκες, αυτός ο ανταγωνισμός εκδηλώνεται όχι μόνο στις ατομικές αλληλεπιδράσεις αλλά και στο επίπεδο της ανθρωπότητας στο σύνολό της. Όσο όλοι οι άνθρωποι έχουν ίσα και απεριόριστα δικαιώματα σε όλους τους πόρους και ακόμη και στα σώματα και τις ζωές του άλλου, η κατάσταση της φύσης είναι ένας πόλεμος «κάθε ανθρώπου εναντίον κάθε ανθρώπου» (Hobbes 76). Αυτή η ζοφερή ερμηνεία πηγάζει άμεσα από την απεικόνιση του Χομπς για την κατάσταση της φύσης που κυβερνάται αποκλειστικά από τις εγωιστικές ορμές των ατόμων.<br/><br/>Ο Λοκ, από την άλλη πλευρά, διαφοροποιεί την κατάσταση της φύσης από την κατάσταση του πολέμου και επισημαίνει ότι, ενώ μπορεί να συμβαίνουν ταυτόχρονα, δεν είναι λόγος να ταυτίζεται το ένα με το άλλο. Ο ορισμός του Λοκ για την κατάσταση του πολέμου είναι ουσιαστικά πανομοιότυπος με αυτόν που προσέφερε ο Χομπς. Σύμφωνα με τον Λοκ, "αυτός που επιχειρεί να βάλει έναν άλλο άνθρωπο στην απόλυτη εξουσία του βάζει έτσι τον εαυτό του σε κατάσταση πολέμου μαζί του" (14). Αυτή η εξήγηση ευθυγραμμίζεται απόλυτα με την Hobbesian αντίληψη ότι το καθολικό δικαίωμα του καθενός στα πάντα, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των σωμάτων και των ζωών των άλλων ανθρώπων, οδηγεί στην κατάσταση του πολέμου. Ωστόσο ο Λοκ αρνείται να εξισώσει την κατάσταση του πολέμου και την κατάσταση της φύσης ακριβώς επειδή αρνείται την ερμηνεία του Χομπς για τη φυσική ελευθερία. Δεδομένου ότι η φυσική κατάσταση του Λοκ συγκρατεί τους ανθρώπους από το να βλάπτουν ο ένας τον άλλον μέσω του δεύτερου περιορισμού της ελευθερίας, μια απόπειρα κατά της ελευθερίας ενός άλλου ατόμου είναι παράβαση του φυσικού νόμου. Ενώ για τον Χομπς, ο πόλεμος είναι η κατάσταση της ανθρωπότητας από προεπιλογή, ο Λοκ την απεικονίζει ως μια διαστροφή της κατάστασης της φύσης και όχι της διακυβέρνησής της.<br/><br/>Αυτές οι διαφορές στην οριοθέτηση του κράτους για τη φύση και τους ψηφοφόρους του, όπως η ελευθερία, η ισότητα, η δικαιοσύνη και ο πόλεμος, ανοίγουν το δρόμο στους συγγραφείς που αντιπαραβάλλουν απεικονίσεις της κυβέρνησης. Με βάση την απαισιόδοξη εκτίμησή του για την κατάσταση της φύσης, ο συγγραφέας του Λεβιάθαν καταλήγει στο συμπέρασμα ότι, υπό συνθήκες πολέμου, δεν μπορεί να υπάρξει οριστική ελπίδα για «να ζήσει ο χρόνος που η φύση επιτρέπει κανονικά στους ανθρώπους να ζήσουν» (Hobbes 80). Η λύση είναι να τεθεί το καθολικό δικαίωμα στα πάντα και να αφεθεί σε όλους "τόση ελευθερία ενάντια σε άλλους ανθρώπους, όπως θα επέτρεπε σε άλλους ανθρώπους ενάντια στον εαυτό του" (Hobbes 80). Οι συμμετέχοντες του προκύπτοντος κοινωνικού συμβολαίου επενδύουν τις απεριόριστες ελευθερίες που έχουν παραδοθεί σε έναν κυρίαρχο – τον κομιστή της υπέρτατης εξουσίας του οποίου σκοπός είναι η διατήρηση του επιτευχθέντος status quo τιμωρώντας όλες τις παραβάσεις εναντίον του. Η εξουσία του Κυρίαρχου είναι απόλυτη: ο ηγεμόνας έχει την εξουσία "να κάνει ό,τι θεωρεί απαραίτητο" για να προωθήσει την ειρήνη μεταξύ των υπηκόων του, έτσι ώστε κανείς να μην επιτίθεται στη ζωή ή την περιουσία κάποιου άλλου (113). Ο Χομπς καταλήγει στο συμπέρασμα ότι χωρίς ένα τέτοιο απροστάτευτο πρόσωπο που δικαιούται να κάνει οτιδήποτε στους υπηκόους, δεν μπορεί να υπάρξει ειρήνη και καμία εγγύηση ασφάλειας.<br/><br/>Ενώ ο Λοκ συμφωνεί με την αναγκαιότητα δημιουργίας πολιτικά οργανωμένων κοινωνιών, παρ' όλα αυτά αντιτίθεται στην ιδέα του Χομπς για την κυρίαρχη εξουσία ως απεριόριστη και απρόσβλητη. Όπως προαναφέρθηκε, η κατάσταση της φύσης του Λοκ δεν είναι σχεδόν τόσο φοβερή όσο αυτή που ζωγράφισε ο Χομπς λόγω της υποχρέωσης του λαού να διατηρήσει όχι μόνο τον εαυτό του αλλά και ο ένας τον άλλον. Ως εκ τούτου, η ανάγκη για κοινωνικό συμβόλαιο προκύπτει όχι από το φόβο των άλλων, αλλά από την καθαρή ευκολία. Οι μικρές κοινότητες μπορεί να μην χρειάζονται πολυάριθμους νόμους για την επίλυση συγκρούσεων και "αξιωματικούς για να επιβλέψουν τη διαδικασία", αλλά μεγαλύτερες ενώσεις θεωρούν σκόπιμο να ιδρύσουν κυβερνήσεις για το σκοπό αυτό (Locke 57). Ωστόσο, η εξουσία της κυβέρνησης δεν μπορεί να είναι απεριόριστη, διότι θα είχε ως αποτέλεσμα να υποτάξει τους υπηκόους σε μια «ασταθή, αβέβαιη, άγνωστη, αυθαίρετη βούληση άλλου ανθρώπου» (Locke 17). Μια τέτοια κυβέρνηση θα αποτελούσε διπλή παραβίαση του φυσικού νόμου. Συμφωνώντας στην απόλυτη εξουσία κάποιου άλλου πάνω στη ζωή του, ένα υποκείμενο θα παραβίαζε τον πρώτο του περιορισμό απαγορεύοντας να βλάψει τον εαυτό του. Όσο για τον ηγεμόνα, η καταστροφή της ελευθερίας ενός άλλου ατόμου θα αποτελούσε άμεση βλάβη και, ως τέτοια, θα ήταν αντιφατική με τον δεύτερο περιορισμό.<br/><br/>Ως άμεση συνέχεια της υπόθεσής του για απεριόριστη κυβερνητική εξουσία, ο Χομπς αρνείται τον διαχωρισμό των εξουσιών ως αρχή. Από την πλευρά του, ο κυρίαρχος, αφού θεσμοθετηθεί, κατέχει «όλη την εξουσία να ορίζει τους κανόνες» που διέπουν τη ζωή των υπηκόων ή, με πιο σύντομους όρους, τη νομοθετική εξουσία (Hobbes 114). Ο ηγεμόνας διατηρεί επίσης το δικαίωμα να "ακούει και να αποφασίζει όλες τις διαμάχες" – δηλαδή, τη δικαστική εξουσία (Hobbes 114). Τέλος, δεδομένου ότι ολόκληρος ο σκοπός του κυρίαρχου είναι να αναγκάσει τους υπηκόους να απέχουν από το να βλάψουν ο ένας τον άλλον, δεν μπορεί να υπάρξει αμφιβολία ότι η εκτελεστική εξουσία είναι επίσης αποκλειστικό του προνόμιο. Ο διαχωρισμός των εξουσιών ως έννοια είναι ξένος για τον Χομπς λόγω των απόψεών του για την κατάσταση της φύσης. Η δημιουργία μιας πολιτικής οντότητας όπου το εκτελεστικό, νομοθετικό και δικαστικό τμήμα θα έλεγχε το ένα το άλλο -δηλαδή, θα ανταγωνιζόταν- θα σήμαινε την αναδημιουργία της Hobbesian κατάστασης της φύσης-σαν-πόλεμου σε υψηλότερο επίπεδο. Από τη στιγμή που ο λαός συνάπτει ένα κοινωνικό συμβόλαιο και ιδρύει μια κυβέρνηση για να θέσει την κατάσταση της φύσης πίσω τους, χωρίς να την επαναφέρει σε διαφορετική μορφή, ο διαχωρισμός των εξουσιών έρχεται σε αντίθεση με τις απόψεις του Χομπς άμεσα.<br/><br/>Ο Λοκ, από την άλλη, αγκαλιάζει τον διαχωρισμό της εξουσίας ως θεμελιώδη αρχή της πολιτικής του θεωρίας. " υπόθεσή του για τον διαχωρισμό είναι εμφανής στη συζήτηση των ορίων της νομοθετικής εξουσίας. Όπως το θέτει ο Λοκ, δύσκολα θα ήταν σκόπιμο "τα ίδια πρόσωπα, που έχουν τη δύναμη να νομοθετούν, να έχουν επίσης στα χέρια τους τη δύναμη να τους εκτελούν" (76). Ο φιλόσοφος επισημαίνει τις ατέλειες της ανθρώπινης φύσης και την έμφυτη επιθυμία να "αρπάζει την εξουσία" ως σκεπτικό για αυτό το προληπτικό μέτρο (Locke 76). Όπως και στην περίπτωση του Χομπς, η αφήγηση του Λοκ για τον διαχωρισμό των εξουσιών πηγάζει άμεσα από την ερμηνεία του για την κατάσταση της φύσης. Αν υπάρχει ήδη δικαιοσύνη στην κατάσταση της φύσης και ο λαός μπορεί να την καταλάβει, κάθε κυβέρνηση υπόκειται αναπόφευκτα στον ίδιο φυσικό νόμο. Δεδομένου ότι η απόλυτη εξουσία επί των ανθρώπων παραβιάζει και τους δύο περιορισμούς αυτού του νόμου, ο διαχωρισμός και η διανομή του είναι σκόπιμος, έτσι ώστε η κυβέρνηση να λειτουργεί κατάλληλα.<br/><br/>Αυτή η εργασία έχει αποδείξει ότι, ενώ οι διαφορές μεταξύ των αφηγήσεων του Χομπς και του Λοκ για τη φυσική κατάσταση της ανθρωπότητας είναι πολυάριθμες, τελικά ισοδυναμούν με την παρουσία απουσίας ηθικών τεκμηρίων. Ο Χομπς θεωρεί τη φυσική κατάσταση ως εκείνη της απεριόριστης ελευθερίας, όπου οι άνθρωποι προικισμένοι με ίσες δυνατότητες και μη δεσμευμένοι από οποιεσδήποτε ηθικές αντιλήψεις, όπως η δικαιοσύνη, ανταγωνίζονται για τους πόρους ακατάπαυστα. Ο Λοκ, ωστόσο, ερμηνεύει την ισότητα και την ελευθερία ηθικά και όχι πρακτικά και οπτικοποιεί ότι ο πόλεμος είναι μια διαστροφή της φυσικής κατάστασης, καθώς ο φυσικός νόμος υποχρεώνει τους ανθρώπους να μην βλάπτουν ο ένας τον άλλον. Αυτή η διαφωνία επηρεάζει τις προσεγγίσεις των φιλοσόφων στην κυβέρνηση. Ο Χομπς επιμένει σε έναν παντοδύναμο ηγεμόνα, καθώς, ελλείψει ηθικών περιορισμών, καμία άλλη εξουσία δεν θα μπορούσε να αναγκάσει τους ανθρώπους να απέχουν από το να βλάψουν ο ένας τον άλλον. Ωστόσο, κατά την άποψη του Λοκ, η παραχώρηση στην κυβέρνηση απεριόριστων εξουσιών θα ήταν αντιφατική με τους ηθικούς περιορισμούς που είναι ενσωματωμένοι στο νόμο της φύσης, γι' αυτό και, σε αντίθεση με τον Χομπς, τάσσεται υπέρ του διαχωρισμού των εξουσιών. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Ποιο Game of Thrones ξέρασε<br/><br/>Ο Καναδός-Γάλλος τραγουδιστής Abbas Hasan έβαλε εκτυφλωτική προσπάθεια για να επισκιάσει όλη την ανθρωπότητα στο Fashion Parade 2014.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....

Για παράδειγμα, η διείσδυση, η εξάτμιση και η ροή του νερού μέσα στο έδαφος. Ως διαδεδομένο φαινόμενο στο έδαφος, η απώθηση του νερού του εδάφους μεταβάλλει τις υδραυλικές λειτουργίες του εδάφους αντιστεκόμενη στη ροή του νερού στα εδάφη. Επιπλέον, οι υδραυλικές ιδιότητες δεν εξαρτώνται μόνο από το σύστημα πόρων του εδάφους αλλά επηρεάζονται και από τις φυσικοχημικές ιδιότητες των επιφανειών των πόρων. Σε σύγκριση με το νερό, η αιθανόλη δεν επηρεάζεται από την απώθηση του νερού λόγω της χαμηλότερης επιφανειακής τάσης του. Ο σκοπός της χρήσης αιθανόλης είναι η εξάλειψη της επίδρασης της απώθησης του νερού του εδάφους στις μετρήσεις των υδραυλικών ιδιοτήτων. Ωστόσο, η εφαρμογή καθαρής αιθανόλης σε φυσικό έδαφος μπορεί να υποβαθμίσει τα οργανικά υλικά του εδάφους και να οδηγήσει σε αλλαγές στις φυσικές ιδιότητες. Ως εκ τούτου, τα υδατικά διαλύματα αιθανόλης μπορεί να είναι μια εναλλακτική επιλογή.Παρ' όλα αυτά, η σκοπιμότητα της χρήσης υδατικής αιθανόλης για τον προσδιορισμό της καμπύλης κατακράτησης υγρών εδάφους παραμένει άγνωστη. Η μελέτη αυτή αποσκοπεί στη δοκιμή της σκοπιμότητας των υδατικών διαλυμάτων αιθανόλης (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % και 100 % v/v) για την καθιέρωση καμπύλης κατακράτησης υγρών κάτω από ένα μικρό εύρος εφαρμοζόμενης πίεσης σε δείγματα χονδροειδούς άμμου με διαφορετική διαβροχή και οργανικό τροποποιημένο φυσικό έδαφος (Templeton silt loam (TSL) με λιπασματοποίηση μανιταριών, βιοχάρτη, γαλακτοκομικά απόβλητα και δημοτικό λιπασματισμό, το ποσοστό εφαρμογής ήταν 15 % κατά βάρος εφαρμογής). Το αποτέλεσμα έδειξε ότι η εκρόφηση των υδατικών διαλυμάτων αιθανόλης σε σύγκριση με το νερό ήταν ταχύτερη κατά περίπου 1 έως 3x με βάση την περιεκτικότητα σε υγρό στην ίδια εφαρμοζόμενη πίεση και το χρόνο για την επίτευξη κάθε ισορροπίας. Τα αποτελέσματα από το πείραμα άμμου πρότειναν ότι όταν η συγκέντρωση υδατικού διαλύματος αιθανόλης ήταν κάτω από 50 %, οι απώλειες μέσω εξάτμισης ήταν λιγότερο από 1% και οι σχετικές διαφορές μεταξύ δοκιμής υγρού και νερού ήταν χαμηλότερες από 10 %. Ωστόσο, οι απώλειες εξάτμισης ήταν 11,06 % και 24,6 %, και οι σχετικές διαφορές ήταν όλες γύρω στο 15 % και 30 % στο διάλυμα 50 % και 100 % αιθανόλης, αντίστοιχα. Σε αντίθεση, οι οργανικές τροποποιήσεις στο θηλαστικό Templeton όχι μόνο αύξησαν την ικανότητα συγκράτησης του νερού αλλά και μείωσαν τις απώλειες εξάτμισης. Οι απώλειες εξάτμισης στο έδαφος TSL και το έδαφος TSL με οργανικές τροποποιήσεις ήταν με 1 % σε διαλύματα με περιεκτικότητα σε αιθανόλη μικρότερη από 50 %. Οι απώλειες εξάτμισης 50 % και 100 % σε αιθανόλη ήταν 2,8% και 2,9%, αντίστοιχα. Οι σχετικές διαφορές μεταξύ νερού και υγρού δοκιμής ήταν παρόμοιες με το πείραμα άμμου όταν οι συγκεντρώσεις υγρού δοκιμής ήταν κάτω από 50 %. Ωστόσο, οι σχετικές διαφορές στο διάλυμα 50 % και 100 % αιθανόλης ήταν μικρότερες από ό,τι στο δείγμα άμμου με περίπου 10 % και 15%, αντίστοιχα. Επιπλέον, η ανάλυση της σχετικής διαφοράς πρότεινε ότι σχεδόν όλα τα υδατικά διαλύματα αιθανόλης είχαν χαμηλότερη ογκομετρική υγρή περιεκτικότητα στην ίδια παρεχόμενη πίεση σε σύγκριση με το νερό, το οποίο ήταν μια αντανάκλαση των υδατικών διαλυμάτων αιθανόλης που αποξηράνθηκαν γρηγορότερα από το νερό υπό ισοδύναμη πίεση. Ως εκ τούτου, το 10 % έως 40 % των διαλυμάτων αιθανόλης θα μπορούσε να θεωρηθεί εναλλακτική λύση για τον προσδιορισμό των υδραυλικών ιδιοτήτων του εδάφους λόγω του ταχύτερου ρυθμού εκρόφησης τους και του ότι δεν επηρεάζονται από την απωθητική δράση του εδάφους. Λόγω της εξάτμισης και διάλυσης του οργανικού υλικού, υδατικά διαλύματα αιθανόλης άνω του 50% συγκέντρωσης δεν ήταν κατάλληλα για χονδροειδή άμμο ή έδαφος μεσαίας υφής.... [Show full abstract] |
