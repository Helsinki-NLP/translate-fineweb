Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Πλοήγηση άρθρων<br/><br/>Το "Life Without Papers" κερδίζει βραβείο Καλύτερης Συγγραφής<br/><br/>Το blog project, "Life Without Papers", που δημιουργήθηκε από τον Len Grant, παρουσιάζει ιστορίες από οικογένειες μεταναστών χωρίς έγγραφα και νέους. Οι μετανάστες χωρίς έγγραφα δεν έχουν τίποτα. Δεν τους επιτρέπεται να εργαστούν. Δεν έχουν δικαίωμα να δηλώνουν επιδόματα ούτε σε ένα μέρος για να ζήσουν. Είναι αθέατες και δυνητικά η πιο ευάλωτη ομάδα στο Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο σήμερα.<br/><br/>Οι μη καταγεγραμμένοι (ή παράτυποι) μετανάστες περιλαμβάνουν εκείνους που διακινούνται στο εμπόριο του σεξ ή για οικιακή υποτέλεια· περιλαμβάνουν τους παραμείνοντες στη βίζα· εκείνους των οποίων οι αιτήσεις ασύλου έχουν απορριφθεί και άλλους που έχουν υποστεί αποτυχίες στο σύστημα μετανάστευσης. Όλα αυτά μπορεί αρχικά να έχουν έρθει στο Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο νόμιμα.<br/><br/>Οι «παράνομοι μετανάστες» – αυτοί που φαντάζονται ότι έχουν εισέλθει στη χώρα στις πλάτες των φορτηγών – αποτελούν ένα μικρό ποσοστό των μη καταγεγραμμένων.<br/><br/>Πράγματι, ορισμένες πηγές αναφέρουν ότι τα μισά από τα περίπου 120.000 παιδιά χωρίς χαρτιά στο Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο γεννήθηκαν εδώ από γονείς χωρίς έγγραφα.<br/><br/>Το blog αφηγείται τις ιστορίες των αδήλωτων.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Μάθημα σαββατιάτικου σχολείου<br/><br/>Στην προς Γαλάτας, ο Παύλος καταπιάνεται με ζητήματα όπως η ελευθερία, ο ρόλος του νόμου στη σωτηρία, η κατάστασή μας στον Χριστό, και η φύση της ζωής που καθοδηγείται από το Πνεύμα, καθώς και το πανάρχαιο ερώτημα, Πώς μπορούν οι αμαρτωλοί άνθρωποι να γίνουν ακριβώς μπροστά σε έναν άγιο και δίκαιο Θεό;<br/><br/>Πολλοί μελετητές πιστεύουν ότι η Γαλάτας μπορεί να είναι η παλαιότερη από τις επιστολές του Παύλου. Γράφτηκε το 49 μ.Χ., λίγο μετά την περίφημη Σύνοδο της Ιερουσαλήμ (Πράξεις 15). Ως εκ τούτου, το βιβλίο μπορεί να είναι το παλαιότερο χριστιανικό έγγραφο που είναι γνωστό. Όπως διευκρινίζουν οι Πράξεις και οι Γαλάτες, η πρώτη εκκλησία βρέθηκε σε σφοδρή μάχη για τη φύση της σωτηρίας, ιδιαίτερα στην περίπτωση των Εθνικών. Σύμφωνα με μια ομάδα Ιουδαίων πιστών, γνωστή ως Ιουδαϊστές, η πίστη στον Ιησού μόνο δεν ήταν αρκετά καλή για τους Εθνικούς.<br/><br/>Ο οδηγός μελέτης της Γραφής αυτού του τετάρτου μας προσκαλεί να ταξιδέψουμε μαζί με τον απόστολο Παύλο καθώς παρακαλεί τους Γαλάτες να παραμείνουν πιστοί στον Ιησού. Μας δίνει επίσης την ευκαιρία να αναλογιστούμε τη δική μας κατανόηση των αληθειών που άνοιξαν το δρόμο για την τελική ρήξη του Μαρτίνου Λούθηρου με τη Ρώμη και την αποκατάσταση του βιβλικού ευαγγελίου. |

Ο κουνιάδος του παραχώρησε το αίτημά του, προήγαγε τον Κάρολο στον βαθμό του στρατάρχη, ο Κάρολος στη συνέχεια πέρασε κάποιο χρόνο ταξιδεύοντας πριν εγκατασταθεί στο Ντάρμστατ, όπου έγινε Πρόεδρος της Αυτοκρατορικής Επιτροπής Πιστώσεων. Μετά τον άτεκνο θάνατο του μεγαλύτερου αδελφού του Αδόλφου Φρειδερίκου Δ' στις 2 Ιουνίου 1794, ως ηγεμόνας, ο Κάρολος ενθάρρυνε τις νέες αγροτικές τάσεις, εγκαθίδρυσε μια νέα αστυνομική δύναμη, και εφάρμοσε την υποχρεωτική εκπαίδευση. Το 1806, το δουκάτο του εντάχθηκε στη Συνομοσπονδία του Ρήνου, μετά το Συνέδριο της Βιέννης, ανέβηκε στο βαθμό του μεγάλου δούκα στις 28 Ιουνίου 1815. Το καλοκαίρι του 1816 ο Κάρολος πήγε σε μια περιοδεία στο Ρέμπμπεργκ του Σβάλμπαχ, λίγο μετά την επιστροφή του αρρώστησε από φλεγμονή των πνευμόνων. Πέθανε στο Νευστρέλιτς μετά από μια κρίση αποπληξίας και τον διαδέχθηκε ο μεγαλύτερος γιος του Γκέοργκ. Δύο από τις κόρες έγιναν Γερμανίδες βασίλισσες, η Σαρλότ πέθανε στις 12 Δεκεμβρίου 1785 λίγο μετά τη γέννηση του γιου τους Δούκα Καρόλου του Μεκλεμβούργου.<br/><br/>1314.<br/>Φρειδερίκος, δούκας του Σαξ-Άλτενμπουργκ<br/>–<br/>Ο Φρειδερίκος, δούκας του Σαξ-Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν, ήταν δούκας του Σαξ-Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν και δούκας του Σαξ-Άλτενμπουργκ. Ήταν το μικρότερο παιδί, αλλά μοναχογιός, του Ερνστ Φρειδερίκου Γ', δούκα του Σαξ-Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν, από την τρίτη σύζυγό του, Ερνεστίνη του Σαξ-Βαϊμάρ. Το 1806 ο Φρειδερίκος εντάχθηκε στη Συνομοσπονδία του Ρήνου, και το 1815 στη Γερμανική Συνομοσπονδία, στο Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν στις 3 Σεπτεμβρίου 1785, ο Φρειδερίκος παντρεύτηκε τη Δούκισσα Σάρλοτ Γκεοργκίν του Μεκλεμβούργου-Στρέλιτς.

Ο Φρειδερίκος θεωρήθηκε δημοφιλής και ευφυής, κατά τη διάρκεια της βασιλείας του, μαζί με την όμορφη σύζυγό του, Σαρλότ, η πολιτιστική ζωή στη μικρή πόλη έφτασε στο ζενίθ της. Τόσοι πολλοί ποιητές και καλλιτέχνες περνούσαν το χρόνο τους εκεί, ώστε ο Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν πήρε το παρατσούκλι Κλάιν-Βαϊμάρη, όταν ο τελευταίος δούκας του Σαξ-Γκότα-Άλτενμπουργκ πέθανε χωρίς θέμα το 1825, οι άλλοι κλάδοι του σπιτιού αποφάσισαν μια αναδιάταξη των Δουκών της Ερνεστίνης. Στις 12 Νοεμβρίου 1826, ο Φρειδερίκος έγινε Δούκας του Σαξ-Άλτενμπουργκ, στον οποίο έδωσε έναν πρώτο Βασικό Νόμο το έτος 1831, σε αντάλλαγμα, μέσα ενημέρωσης που σχετίζονται με τον Φρειδερίκο, Δούκα του Σαξ-Άλτενμπουργκ στο Wikimedia Commons geneall. net<br/><br/>Φρειδερίκος, δούκας του Σαξ-Άλτενμπουργκ<br/>–<br/>Φρειδερίκος<br/><br/>15.<br/>Δούκισσα Σαρλότ Γκεοργκίν του Μεκλεμβούργου-Στρέλιτς<br/>–<br/>Η Σαρλότ Γκεοργκίν γεννήθηκε στο Ανόβερο, Εκλεκτοράτο του Μπράνσγουικ-Λύνεμπουργκ. Ήταν το μεγαλύτερο παιδί και κόρη του Καρόλου Β', Μεγάλου Δούκα του Μεκλεμβούργου, της Σαρλότ και των αδελφών της, της Βασίλισσας Λουίζας της Πρωσίας, της Βασίλισσας Φρειδερίκης του Αννοβέρου και της Πριγκίπισσας Τερέζ του Θουρν ουντ Τάξις, θεωρήθηκαν οι πιο όμορφες γυναίκες της εποχής τους. Ο Ζαν Πολ Φρίντριχ Ρίχτερ αφιέρωσε το μυθιστόρημά του Τιτάνας στους τέσσερις όμορφους, η Σαρλότ μεγάλωσε στο Ανόβερο, όπου ο πατέρας της υπηρέτησε ως κυβερνήτης, για λογαριασμό του κουνιάδου του, βασιλιά Γεωργίου Γ' του Ηνωμένου Βασιλείου, ο οποίος ζούσε στο Λονδίνο. Όταν η Σαρλότ ήταν δώδεκα ετών, η μητέρα της πέθανε και ανατράφηκε από τη μητέρα της αδελφή της, Σαρλότ, η οποία παντρεύτηκε τον πατέρα της το 1784 και τις αδελφές της τις έφερε η γιαγιά της, Μαρία Λουίζ Αλμπερτίν του Λάινινγκεν-Φάλκενμπουργκ-Ντάγκσμπουργκ στο Ντάρμσταντ. Στις 3 Σεπτεμβρίου 1785, σε ηλικία δεκαπέντε ετών, η Σαρλότ παντρεύτηκε τον δούκα Φρειδερίκο, δούκα του Σαξ-Άλτενμπουργκ, ο γάμος δεν ήταν ευτυχισμένος, η Σαρλότ ήταν διανοητικά ανώτερη από τον Φρειδερίκο, ο οποίος άρχισε να την αγνοεί. Είχαν επίσης προβλήματα, το Σαξ-Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν είχε καταστραφεί οικονομικά από τις καταστροφικές πολιτικές των προκατόχων του Φρειδερίκου. Οι δέκτες επέτρεψαν στον Δούκα και τη Δούκισσα μόνο έναν μειωμένο Πολιτικό Κατάλογο, ο πατέρας της Σάρλοτ και δύο αδέλφια συχνά έμεναν με τη Σάρλοτ στο Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν. Το 1787, η ίδια μετακόμισε μόνιμα στο Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν και έγινε πρόεδρος της επιτροπής πίστωσης. Το 1792, η γιαγιά της Σαρλότς και οι αδελφές της διέφυγαν πριν ο προελαύνων γαλλικός στρατός από το Ντάρμστατ στο Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν και η γιαγιά της παρατηρήσουν τον σύζυγο της Σαρλότς. Η Σάρλοτ, που δεν αγάπησε ποτέ αυτόν τον άντρα, είναι πάντα έγκυος, η οικογένεια πέρασε αρκετές ξέγνοιαστες εβδομάδες στο Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν. Το 1793, η γιαγιά της Σαρλότς επέστρεψε από την εξορία και ταξίδεψε με τις αδελφές της Σαρλότς στη Φρανκφούρτη αμ Μάιν, η Σαρλότ είχε μια πολύ στενή και στοργική σχέση με την αδελφή της Φρειδερίκη και συγγενείς στο Στρέλιτς. Το 1803 και το 1805, το πρωσικό βασιλικό ζεύγος επισκέφθηκε το Χίλντμπουργκχαουζεν, για την περίσταση αυτή, οι δέκτες επέτρεψαν στο δουκικό ζευγάρι να ανανεώσει μερικά από τα έπιπλά τους. Η Λουίζ είχε βοηθήσει στη σύνταξη της κήρυξης του πολέμου, ο Κρίστιαν Τρούτσσετς φον Βέτσχαουζεν ζου Μπέτενμπουργκ ήταν φίλος του δουκικού ζεύγους και νονός του Σαρλότς γιου του Εδουάρδου. Πολλοί θεατές είχαν έρθει να δουν τη Βαυαρή Πριγκίπισσα του Στέμματος, όταν δεχόταν τους καλεσμένους του, η Τρούτσε προσπάθησε να οδηγήσει την κατώτερη Καρλόττα πρώτα στο κάστρο του, αλλά εκείνη αρνήθηκε, αναφερόμενος στην κόρη της. Η Τρουχσέ απάντησε, Υψηλότατε, θα με συγχωρέσει, αλλά όσο αυτό το κάστρο στέκεται εδώ, η Τερέζ τότε άρπαξε τους βαρόνους από το άλλο χέρι, και οι τρεις τους περπάτησαν από την πύλη μαζί. Η Δούκισσα έδωσε περίπου το μισό του εισοδήματός της στους φτωχούς, συνταξιούχους<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Πρίγκιπας Κάρολος της Έσσης-Κάσσελ<br/>–<br/>Ο πρίγκιπας Κάρολος της Έσσης-Κάσσελ ήταν δόκιμο μέλος του οίκου της Έσσης-Κάσσελ και Δανός στρατηγός στρατάρχης. Μεγαλωμένος με συγγενείς του στην αυλή της Δανίας, πέρασε το μεγαλύτερο μέρος της ζωής του στη Δανία και η μητέρα του ήταν κόρη του βασιλιά Γεωργίου Β' της Μεγάλης Βρετανίας και της Καρολάιν του Άνσμπαχ και αδελφής της βασίλισσας Λουίζας της Δανίας. Ο πατέρας του, ο μελλοντικός κτηματίας, εγκατέλειψε την οικογένεια το 1747, το 1755 τερμάτισε επίσημα τον γάμο με τη Μαρία. Ο παππούς, Γουλιέλμος Η', λαντγκράβος της Έσσης, παραχώρησε την κομητεία του Χανάου και τα έσοδά της στη Μαρία, ο νεαρός πρίγκιπας Κάρολος και τα δύο αδέλφια του, Γουλιέλμος και Φρειδερίκος, ανατράφηκαν από τη μητέρα τους και ανατράφηκαν από προτεστάντες συγγενείς από το 1747. Το 1756, η Μαρία μετακόμισε στη Δανία, για να φροντίσει τα ανήλικα παιδιά της αδελφής της, Βασίλισσας Λουίζας της Δανίας. Οι Ησσιανοί πρίγκιπες αργότερα παρέμειναν στη Δανία, γινόμενοι οι σημαντικοί άρχοντες της, μόνο ο μεγαλύτερος αδελφός Γουλιέλμος επέστρεψε στην Έσση, το 1785, όταν ανέβηκε στο landgraviate. Το 1758 διορίστηκε συνταγματάρχης, σε ηλικία 20 ετών υποστράτηγος, επίσης το 1766, διορίστηκε Γενικός Κυβερνήτης της Νορβηγίας, θέση που κατείχε μέχρι το 1768 αλλά παρέμεινε ως επί το πλείστον τιτουλάριος, καθώς δεν πήγε ποτέ στη Νορβηγία κατά τη διάρκεια αυτής της περιόδου. Το 1763, ο μεγαλύτερος αδελφός του Γουλιέλμος παντρεύτηκε τον πρώτο τους ξάδελφο, ο Κάρολος ακολούθησε το παράδειγμά του στις 30 Αυγούστου 1766 στο Ανάκτορο Κρίστιανσμποργκ - η σύζυγός του ήταν η Λουίζα της Δανίας και έτσι ο Κάρολος έγινε κουνιάδος με τον ξάδελφό του, Βασιλιά Χριστιανό Ζ'. Ο γάμος έγινε παρά τις συμβουλές που δόθηκαν εναντίον του, λόγω κατηγοριών για ακολασία από τον Πρίγκιπα Κάρολο. Λίγο αργότερα, ο Κάρολος έπεσε σε δυσμένεια στην Αυλή, και στις αρχές του 1767 αυτός και αυτοί θα έκαναν το πρώτο τους παιδί, τη Μαρί Σόφι, εκεί το 1767 και στη συνέχεια το δεύτερο παιδί τους, τον Γουίλιαμ, το 1769. Το 1768, ο Κάρολος αγόρασε την ιδιοκτησία και το χωριό Offenbach-Rumpenheim από την οικογένεια Edelsheim. Το 1771 είχε την έπαυλη επεκταθεί σε ένα κάστρο και πριγκιπική έδρα και η μητέρα του Μαρία ζούσε στο παλάτι μέχρι το θάνατό της το 1772. Το 1781, ο Κάρολος πούλησε το Παλάτι Ρούμπενχαϊμ στον μικρότερο αδελφό του, ο Κάρολος εγκαταστάθηκε στο κάστρο Γκόττορπ στο Σλέσβιχ με την οικογένειά του. Θα είχαν εκεί το τρίτο τους παιδί τον Φρειδερίκο το 1771, το 1770, ο Βασιλιάς Χριστιανός Ζ' έδωσε στην αδελφή του την περιουσία του Τέγκελχοφ στο Γκέμπι μεταξύ της Πόλης του Σλέσβιχ και του Έκερνφορντε. Από το 1772 έως το 1776, ο Κάρολος είχε μια θερινή κατοικία που κατασκευάστηκε στην τοποθεσία την οποία ονόμασε Λουίζνλουντ προς τιμή της συζύγου του, τον Σεπτέμβριο του 1772, ο Κάρολος διορίστηκε αρχιστράτηγος του Νορβηγικού στρατού και αυτός και η Λουίζ μετακόμισαν στη Χριστιάνα. Η ανάθεση ήταν συνέπεια του πραξικοπήματος του βασιλιά Γουσταύου Γ' της Σουηδίας στις 19 Αυγούστου 1772, ενώ στη Νορβηγία, η πριγκίπισσα Λουίζ γέννησε το τέταρτο παιδί τους, την Τζουλιάν το 1773.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Λουίζ Καρολάιν της Έσσης-Κάσσελ<br/>–<br/>Η Λουίζ Καρολάιν γεννήθηκε στο Γκόττορπ του Δουκάτου του Σλέσβιχ από τον Λάντγκρεϊβ Κάρολο της Έσσης-Κάσσελ και τη σύζυγό του Πριγκίπισσα Λουίζα της Δανίας.<br/>–<br/>Πριγκίπισσα Λουίζ Καρολάιν<br/><br/>19.<br/>Πρίγκιπας Φρειδερίκος της Έσσης<br/>–<br/>Λάντγκρεϊβ Φρειδερίκου<br/><br/>20.<br/>Πρίγκιπας Γουλιέλμος της Έσσης Πρίγκιπας Γουλιέλμος της Έσσης<br/>–<br/>Γουλιέλμος της Έσσης-Κάσσελ<br/><br/>212223 (στα Αγγλικά).<br/>Πριγκίπισσα Λουίζ24.<br/>Σοφία Φρειδερίκη του Μεκλεμβούργου-Σβερίν<br/>–<br/>Σοφία Φρειδερίκη του Με252627 μητρική28.<br/>Αλβέρτος Αζζο Β', μαργράβος του Μιλάνου<br/>–<br/>Ο Αλμπέρτο Αζζό Β', μαργράβος του Μιλάνου και η Λιγουρία, κόμης του Γκαβέλο και της Πάδουα, του Ροβίγκο, της Λουνιτζιάνα, του Μονσελίτσε και της Μοντανιάνα, γνωστός και ως Αλμπερτέζο Β', ήταν ισχυρός ευγενής στην Αγία Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία. Θεωρείται ο ιδρυτής της Casa dEste, αφού ήταν επικεφαλής της πρώτης οικογένειας που ήταν κύριος του Έστε, ο Αλμπέρτο Αζζό Β ' ήταν ο μόνος γιος του Αλβέρτου Αζζό Α ', μαργράβου του Μιλάνου. Κληρονόμησε τα γραφεία των πατέρων του γύρω στο 1020, και συνεχώς αύξησε τις ιδιοκτησίες του στη βόρεια Ιταλία, το 1069-1070, προσπάθησε να αποκτήσει το Μέιν για τον γιο του Χιου, επειδή η σύζυγός του, Γκαρσένδη, ήταν συν-κληρονόμος των προηγούμενων κόμητων του Μέιν. Ο Χιου ανακηρύχθηκε κόμης, αλλά δεν μπορούσε να επικρατήσει εναντίον του Ροβέρτου, δούκα της Νορμανδίας, στην διερευνητική διαμάχη μεταξύ του Ερρίκου Δ', Αγίου Ρωμαίου Αυτοκράτορα, και του Πάπα Γρηγόριου Ζ', ο Αζζό επιχείρησε να μεσολαβήσει, αλλά αργότερα εντάχθηκε στο πλευρό του πάπα. Γύρω στο 1073 έφτιαξε ένα κάστρο στο Έστε την κατοικία του, από το οποίο ο Οίκος των Έστε, πριν από το οικοδομικό του έργο, ο Έστε δεν ήταν τίποτα περισσότερο από ένα χωριό. Ο γιος του Γουέλφ μετακόμισε πρώτα στην Καρινθία και στη συνέχεια στη Βαυαρία, δίνοντας αφορμή για μια από τις σημαντικότερες οικογένειες στην ευρωπαϊκή ιστορία, ένας άλλος γιος, ο Φούλκ Α' του Μιλάνου, έκανε την πρώτη τεκμηριωμένη χρήση του τίτλου Marquis dEste. Ο Αζζό Β' παντρεύτηκε την Κουνιγκούντε, κόρη του Γουέλφου Β' κόμη του Άλτντορφ και απέκτησαν ένα γνωστό παιδί, τον Γουέλφο δούκα της Βαυαρίας από το 1070 έως το 1077 και από το 1096 μέχρι το θάνατό του που ήταν το πρώτο μέλος του κλάδου των Γουέλφων του Οίκου των Έστε. Ο δεύτερος γάμος του ήταν με την Γκαρσένδη, κόρη του Χέρμπερτ Α', κόμη του Μέιν και είχαν τους εξής γνωστούς γιους, τον Φούλκο Α', μαργράβο του Μιλάνου, πρόγονο του ιταλικού κλάδου του Οίκου των Έστε Χιου Ε', κόμη του Μέιν, δεν είχε κανένα θέμα. Ορισμένες πηγές αναφέρουν ότι παντρεύτηκε επίσης τη Βιτάλια Ορσεόλο, κόρη του Πέτρου Ορσεόλο και είχε εξωσυζυγική σχέση με τη Ματίλντα, αδελφή του Γουλιέλμου, επισκόπου της Πάδοβας, με την οποία απέκτησε μια κόρη, την Αδελαία, η οποία παντρεύτηκε τον Γκουλιέλμο Αντελάρντι.

Ήταν το πρώτο μέλος του κλάδου Γουέλφων του Οίκου των Έστε, στη γενεαλογία του Πρεσβύτερου Οίκου των Γουέλφων λογίζεται ως Γουέλφος Δ'. Ο Γουέλφος ήταν γιος του Αζζο Β' του Έστε και της συζύγου του Κουνιγκούντε του Άλτντορφ, όταν ο μητρικός θείος των Γουέλφων, Γουέλφος, δούκας της Καρινθίας, πέθανε άτεκνος, ο Γουέλφος κληρονόμησε την περιουσία του. Ο Γουέλφος παντρεύτηκε την Έθελιντ του Νορθίμ, κόρη του Όθωνα Β' δούκα της Βαυαρίας, όταν ο πεθερός του, δούκας Όθων είχε γίνει εχθρός του βασιλιά Ερρίκου Δ' και έχασε το δουκάτο του, ο Γουέλφος παρέμεινε πιστός στον βασιλιά. Σε συμμόρφωση με τις εντολές του Ερρίκου, αποκήρυξε και χώρισε τη δούκισσα του, Έθελιντ και το γεγονός αυτό έλαβε χώρα στο Γκόσλαρ το 1070, όταν τα κρατίδια της Βαυαρίας υποτάχθηκαν ήσυχα στον νεοσύστατο δούκα, ο οποίος ήταν ο εκπρόσωπος μιας από τις αρχαιότερες οικογένειες της επαρχίας. Ο Πάπας και ο αυτοκράτορας συμφιλιώθηκαν επιφανειακά το 1076, αλλά το έτος τους είδε και πάλι να εμπλέκονται σε ενεργές εχθροπραξίες. Ο Ερρίκος, συνεπεία επανειλημμένων πράξεων εξέγερσης, ανακήρυξε τον Γουέλφ καθαιρεμένο στο νεοαποκτηθέν δουκάτο του. Ωστόσο, υποστηριζόμενος από τους πιστούς Βαυαρούς του, και βοηθούμενος από τον πατέρα του στην Ιταλία, ο Γουέλφ μπόρεσε να διατηρήσει τη θέση του, ωστόσο, ο Γρηγόριος πέθανε το 1085 και οι διάδοχοί του πήραν ένα λιγότερο εντατικό μέρος στις υποθέσεις της Γερμανίας. Ο Γουέλφος, αν και ακόμα προσκολλημένος στο κόμμα της εκκλησίας, μετά το διαζύγιο, το 1070, από την πρώτη του σύζυγο, παντρεύτηκε την Ιουδήθ της Φλάνδρας, κόρη του Βαλδουίνου Δ', κόμη της Φλάνδρας και χήρα του Τόστιγκ Γκόντγουινσον, κόμη της Νορθουμβρίας. Το 1089, ο Γουέλφος γιος Γουέλφος παντρεύτηκε την Ματθίλδη της Τοσκάνης, ενισχύοντας έτσι τις σχέσεις με τον πάπα, ωστόσο, αφού ο νεότερος Γουέλφος χώρισε την Ματθίλδη το 1095, ο Γουέλφος επανόρθωσε με τον βασιλιά Ερρίκο Δ' και επαναβεβαιώθηκε στη θέση του ως δούκας της Βαυαρίας. Μετά το θάνατο του πατέρα του Αζζό το 1097, ο Γουέλφος προσπάθησε να αποκτήσει την περιουσία των πατέρων του νότια των Άλπεων, το 1099, ο Γουέλφος εντάχθηκε σε αυτό που θα γινόταν γνωστό ως Σταυροφορία του 1101, μαζί με τον Γουλιέλμο Θ ' της Ακουιτανίας, τον Ούγο του Βερμαντουά και την Ίντα της Αυστρίας. Η κύρια επιτυχία του ήταν να αποτρέψει μια σύγκρουση μεταξύ ομοθρήσκων Σταυροφόρων, οι οποίοι είχαν λεηλατήσει βυζαντινά εδάφη στο δρόμο τους προς την Κωνσταντινούπολη, ο ίδιος ο Γουέλφ δραπέτευσε από το φιάσκο, αλλά πέθανε στο δρόμο της επιστροφής του στην Πάφο της Κύπρου, το 1101 και τάφηκε στο Αββαείο του Βάινγκαρτεν.

Ο Ερρίκος ήταν γιος του δούκα Γουέλφου Α' της Βαυαρίας από τον γάμο του με την Ιουδήθ. Ως νεαρός, διηύθυνε τις οικογενειακές ιδιοκτησίες Έστε νότια των Άλπεων, μέσω του γάμου του με τη Γουλφχίλδη, κόρη του δούκα Μάγκνους της Σαξονίας, περίπου το 1095, απέκτησε μέρος των κτημάτων Μπιλούνγκ γύρω από το Λύνεμπουργκ. Φιλοδοξούσε να διαδεχθεί τον πεθερό του ως Σάξονας δούκας όταν ο Μάγκνους πέθανε χωρίς κληρονόμους το 1106. Ο δούκας Ερρίκος παρ' όλα αυτά διατήρησε στενές σχέσεις με την κυβερνώσα δυναστεία των Σαλίων, το 1116, εντάχθηκε στον αυτοκράτορα Ερρίκο Ε ' δεύτερη ιταλική εκστρατεία για να καταλάβει τα κτήματα της ύστερης Μαργκράβινας Ματθίλδης της Τοσκάνης. Διαδέχθηκε τον μεγαλύτερο αδελφό του Γουέλφ Β' ως Βαυαρός δούκας, όταν ο τελευταίος πέθανε άτεκνος το 1120, ο Ερρίκος ήταν επίσης καθοριστικός παράγοντας για την επίτευξη του Κονκορδάτου του Βορμς του 1122, τερματίζοντας τη μακροχρόνια διερευνητική διαμάχη μεταξύ του Πάπα και του Αυτοκράτορα. Ο γάμος ολοκληρώθηκε τον Μάιο του 1127, η αποξένωση μεταξύ των δυναστειών Γουέλφ και Χοενστάουφεν διήρκεσε μέχρι τον 13ο αιώνα. Μετά την νίκη του Λοθάριου στις εκλογές, επέβαλε αυτοκρατορική απαγόρευση στον Φρειδερίκο Β', ωστόσο.

| What's everyone giving their trick or treaters tonight? We're giving out some chocolates (nut free) and chips (nut and gluten free), as well as Halloween pencils and erasers. I love Halloween!!! I love seeing all the costumes! In case you're wondering why we can give out pencils, erasers and lots of goodies to our trick or treaters, this is why...<br/><br/>We only get about a dozen or so kids in our neighbourhood!! It's a far cry from the 300 and something kids we always had in the city!!! Hubby doesn't mind. This way he gets to have all the goodies that weren't given out!<br/><br/>6<br/>comments:<br/><br/>It was Halloween here last night and we had ...... no kids at all at our door.<br/><br/>Halloween is not really celebrated here. The shopkeepers try to promote it by advertising and selling various Halloween gear but it just doesn't catch on at all. In fact there is a resistance to it by many.<br/><br/>have a fun halloween! it's 6:30 right now and we haven't had any trick or treaters yet. i've got "candy detail" tonight. my husband is taking tc around the neighborhood tonight.<br/><br/>we're giving out mini chocolate bars and the costco candy mix (lollipops, sweet tarts, tootsie rolls and such). we have some duddy bubble gum for the rude kids who don't say trick or treat, please or thank you (normallhy the older teenagers). i'm so mean. if they're not nice to me, then they get a one tiny crappy piece of candy. let's hope they don't egg our house later that night. ha ha | Τι δίνουν όλοι το τέχνασμά τους ή οι κεραστές τους απόψε; Δίνουμε μερικές σοκολάτες (χωρίς καρύδια) και πατατάκια (χωρίς καρύδια και γλουτένη), καθώς και αποκριάτικα μολύβια και γόμες. Λατρεύω το Halloween!!! Μου αρέσει να βλέπω όλα τα κοστούμια! Σε περίπτωση που αναρωτιέσαι γιατί μπορούμε να δώσουμε μολύβια, γόμες και πολλά καλούδια στο τέχνασμα ή τους κερματοδέκτες μας, αυτός είναι ο λόγος...<br/><br/>Παίρνουμε μόνο περίπου μια ντουζίνα παιδιά στη γειτονιά μας!! Είναι μακριά από τα 300 και κάτι παιδιά που είχαμε πάντα στην πόλη!!! Ο Hubby δεν τον πειράζει. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο παίρνει να έχει όλα τα καλούδια που δεν δόθηκαν!<br/><br/>6<br/>Σχόλια:<br/><br/>Ήταν απόκριες εδώ χθες το βράδυ και δεν είχαμε καθόλου παιδιά στην πόρτα μας.<br/><br/>Το Halloween δεν γιορτάζεται πραγματικά εδώ. Οι καταστηματάρχες προσπαθούν να το προωθήσουν διαφημίζοντας και πουλώντας διάφορα εργαλεία του Halloween αλλά απλά δεν πιάνει καθόλου. Στην πραγματικότητα υπάρχει μια αντίσταση σε αυτό από πολλούς.<br/><br/>Διασκεδάστε απόκριες! Είναι 6:30 αυτή τη στιγμή και δεν είχαμε κανένα τέχνασμα ή λιχουδιές ακόμα. Έχω "λεπτομέρεια καραμέλας" απόψε.

Είμαι τόσο κακός. Αν δεν είναι καλοί μαζί μου, τότε παίρνουν ένα μικρό σκατό κομμάτι καραμέλας. Ας ελπίσουμε ότι δεν θα αυγώσουν το σπίτι μας αργότερα εκείνο το βράδυ. |
| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Ακολουθήστε μας<br/><br/>ΕΙΜΑΙ ΕΣΥ<br/><br/>ΑΣΦΑΛΙΣΤΗΣ<br/><br/>Να τι προσπαθεί να σου πει το σώμα σου<br/><br/>από<br/>Μπάιρντι.<br/><br/>ΦΩΤΟ:<br/><br/>Ζακήμου<br/><br/>Η αύξηση του βάρους από τους εκτός ελέγχου πόθους, μπορεί να είναι απογοητευτικό να έχουμε μια συνεχή λαχτάρα για κάτι ανθυγιεινό και να μην ξέρουμε γιατί. Τα καλά νέα είναι ότι συνήθως υπάρχει ένας λόγος που κρύβεται πίσω από αυτή την καυστική επιθυμία να στεγάσετε μια σακούλα πατατάκια, ή την αίσθηση ότι μπορεί πραγματικά να πεθάνετε αν δεν πάρετε ένα τουρσί δεξιάαυτόστιγμή (ακόμα και αν δεν είστε έγκυος). Αν έχετε οράματα με τις μπάρες του Γαλαξία, για παράδειγμα, θα μπορούσε να σημαίνει ότι σας λείπει ένα πολύ συγκεκριμένο θρεπτικό συστατικό στη διατροφή σας. (Yup - είναι πιο περίπλοκο από ό, τι είπε σοκολάτα μπαρ είναι τόσο αναθεματισμένα νόστιμα.)<br/><br/>Μιλήσαμε με τον διαιτολόγο από το Λος Άντζελες Σίρα Λεντσέφσκι, M.S., R.D., για να πάρετε το κοκαλιάρικο σε μερικές κοινές λαχτάρες για φαγητό, καθώς και τι μπορείτε να κάνετε για να χορτάσετε την πείνα χωρίς να πάτε στη θάλασσα.<br/><br/>Αν λαχταράς σοκολάτα<br/><br/>Σημαίνει: Μπορεί να σου λείπει το μαγνήσιο στη διατροφή σου, λέει ο Λεντσέφσκι. «Το μαγνήσιο είναι ένα απαραίτητο ορυκτό που εμπλέκεται στην παραγωγή ενέργειας, στο μεταβολισμό της γλυκόζης και στη λειτουργία των μυών. Αυτό ισχύει ιδιαίτερα για εκείνους που χτυπούν σκληρά το γυμναστήριο», εξηγεί. Επιπλέον, τα επίπεδα μαγνησίου χαμηλότερα κατά τη διάρκεια των προ-εμμηνορροϊκών εβδομάδων της περιόδου σας, γεγονός που εξηγεί γιατί το PMS έρχεται τόσο συχνά με πόθους σοκολάτας.<br/><br/>Αντ 'αυτού, να φτάσει για υψηλής ποιότητας, χαμηλής περιεκτικότητας σε ζάχαρη μαύρη σοκολάτα, η οποία είναι φυσικά υψηλή σε μαγνήσιο. "Συνιστώ να κολλήσει σε 75 τοις εκατό κακάο ή υψηλότερη, και να το συνδυάσει με μια άλλη πηγή πλούσια σε μαγνήσιο όπως ηλιόσπορους," λέει ο Lenchewski. Προτείνει τη μάρκα σοκολάτας Hu, μια μικρή εταιρεία τροφίμων που επικεντρώνεται σε υψηλής ποιότητας συστατικά που παράγονται τοπικά. "Είναι λίγο ακριβό, αλλά ένας ακόμη λόγος για να κρατήσει τις μερίδες υπό έλεγχο", λέει. "Είναι το προσωπικό μου αγαπημένο." Είμαστε επίσης μεγάλοι οπαδοί του σούπερ φαγώσιμου Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Αν λαχταράς γλυκά<br/><br/>Σημαίνει: «Το να σκαλίζεις την καθαρή ζάχαρη είναι μια καλή ένδειξη ότι σου τελειώνει η ενέργεια», λέει ο Λέντσεφσκι. «Σκέψου το. Ποιο είναι το μόνο πράγμα για το οποίο σε τρώει μετά από έναν τρομερό νυχτερινό ύπνο ή γύρω στις 4 μ.μ. κατά τη διάρκεια μιας αγχωτικής εργάσιμης ημέρας; Η απάντηση είναι συνήθως ζάχαρη επειδή χρησιμοποιείται ως άμεσο καύσιμο για τα κύτταρα του σώματός μας».<br/><br/>Αντ' αυτού, ψάξτε για μήλα με βούτυρο καρυδιού. "Αν κάνετε επιδρομή στο απόθεμα καραμελών των συναδέλφων σας, προτείνω έναν πιο αργό καμένο υδατάνθρακα με πηγή λίπους ή πρωτεΐνης", λέει ο Λεντσέφσκι. "Σε αντίθεση με την απλή ζάχαρη, αυτό θα τροφοδοτήσει τα κύτταρά σας αποφεύγοντας τη συντριβή μετά τη ζάχαρη. Δύο επιλογές που κάνουν για μεγάλα pick-me-ups την επόμενη φορά που θα λαχταράτε γλυκά: ένα τεμαχισμένο μήλο με την επιλογή σας από βούτυρο καρυδιού, ή μούρα με 2% ελληνικό γιαούρτι χωρίς ζάχαρη." Μας αρέσει να τρέμουμε ένα γλυκό δόντι με αυτά τα εθιστικά τσιπς καρύδας, επίσης - γεμίζουν, απαλλαγμένα από οποιαδήποτε πρόσθετη ζάχαρη, και απλά τόσο καλά.<br/><br/>Αν λαχταράς αλάτι<br/><br/>Σημαίνει: "Αν δεν κάνει τίποτα άλλο από το πιο αλμυρό τουρσί, μπορεί να μην πίνετε αρκετό H2O", λέει ο Lenchewski. "Το αλάτι βοηθάει το σώμα να κρατηθεί στο νερό, οπότε το ποθούμε όταν έχουμε ανάγκη από υγρά".<br/><br/>Αντ' αυτού, ψάξτε για νερό. "Μείνετε ενυδατωμένοι, ειδικά καθώς πλησιάζουμε τους καλοκαιρινούς μήνες", λέει. Την επόμενη φορά που θα χτυπήσει μια λαχτάρα, δοκιμάστε να την σβήσετε (κυριολεκτικά) με μερικά δροσιστικά ποτήρια και ίσως βρείτε την επείγουσα ανάγκη να εξαφανισθεί η νάτριο. «Αν το σκέτο νερό σε κουράζει, δοκίμασε να προσθέσεις μέντα, λεμόνι ή κατεψυγμένα φρούτα για να το ανακατέψεις», λέει ο Λέντσεφσκι. «Αν τελικά λαχταράς πραγματικά το αλάτι, τα φρυγανισμένα φύκια είναι μια μεγάλη επιλογή χαμηλών θερμίδων», λέει.<br/><br/>Αν λαχταράς αμυλούχους υδατάνθρακες όπως τα ζυμαρικά<br/><br/>Σημαίνει: "Επειδή τα τρόφιμα με υψηλή περιεκτικότητα σε υδατάνθρακες ενισχύουν την αίσθηση-καλή ορμόνη σεροτονίνη, οι πόθοι αμύλου μπορεί να είναι ένα σημάδι ότι χρειάζεστε ένα ενισχυτικό διάθεσης", λέει ο Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Αντ 'αυτού, να φτάσει για ένα μπάνιο! "Bust out τα άλατα Epsom, γιατί είναι καιρός για κάποια σοβαρή R + R," λέει ο Lenchewski. "Εμπιστευτείτε με. εντρυφώντας σε ένα άμυλο δωρεάν-για-όλους αισθάνεται πραγματικά καλό στη στιγμή, αλλά πιθανότατα θα σας bum έξω περισσότερο την επόμενη μέρα." (Όπως γνωρίζει οποιοσδήποτε έχει ποτέ παραγεμίσει μια πίτσα ή μια λαχτάρα για ζυμαρικά.) Έτσι, την επόμενη φορά που θα θέλετε να βουτήξετε το κεφάλι σας πρώτα σε ένα μπολ με υδατάνθρακες, να τραβήξετε ένα μπάνιο, να ανάψετε ένα κερί και να περιποιηθείτε τον εαυτό σας χωρίς να μετανιώσετε ή πυκνές θερμίδες.<br/><br/>Αν λαχταράς παγωτό<br/><br/>5 / 6 ετών<br/><br/>Σημαίνει: «Το σώμα σου μπορεί να σου λέει ότι έχει ανάγκη από κάποιο υγιές λίπος».<br/><br/>Αντ' αυτού, ψάξτε για παγωτό καρύδας. "Είμαι ρεαλιστής, οπότε αν θέλετε παγωτό, δεν πρόκειται να συστήσω μια χούφτα καρύδια, τα οποία είναι, φυσικά, γεμάτα υγιή λιπαρά", λέει ο Λέντσεφσκι. "Για επείγουσες περιπτώσεις παγωτού, προτείνω παγωτά καρύδας χαμηλότερης περιεκτικότητας σε ζάχαρη όπως το Coconut Bliss ή το παγωτό τριών συστατικών του Kippy στο Λος Άντζελες." Μπορούμε να εγγυηθούμε για το γεγονός ότι το παγωτό καρύδας έχει απίστευτη και ακριβώς όπως το πραγματικό πράγμα.<br/><br/>Αν λαχταράς ένα μπιφτέκι<br/><br/>Σημαίνει: Χρειάζεσαι σίδηρο. "Αν δεν μπορείς να σταματήσεις να σκέφτεσαι το κόκκινο κρέας, υπάρχει πιθανότητα το σώμα σου να λαχταρά σίδηρο, β12 και φολικό οξύ", λέει ο Λεντσέφσκι. "Αυτό ισχύει ιδιαίτερα κατά τη διάρκεια ή γύρω από εκείνη την περίοδο του μήνα."<br/><br/>Αντ' αυτού, ψάξτε για ένα πιο υγιεινό μπιφτέκι. "Είμαι υπέρμαχος του χορταρικού, αντιβιοτικού και χωρίς ορμόνες κόκκινου κρέατος μία φορά την εβδομάδα", λέει ο Lenchewski. "Προσπάθησε να πειραματιστείς με ένα ανοιχτόχρωμο μπιφτέκι βίσωνα - το οποίο, κομμένο για κόψιμο, είναι πιο λιτό και έχει περισσότερο σίδηρο από το βοδινό". Μην τρώτε κρέας; Προσπαθήστε να ενσωματώσετε κάποιο είδος συμπληρώματος σιδήρου φυτικής προέλευσης στη ρουτίνα σας, όπως η σπιρουλίνα. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Υπηρεσίες Ιστού, Πωλητές και Νόμοι για τον Κυβερνοχώρο!<br/><br/>Ενημερώθηκε στις:21 Απριλίου 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Η μηχανογράφηση αυτού του κόσμου άλλαξε σε μεγάλο βαθμό το σενάριο των ανθρώπινων επιδόσεων και αυτό πολύ πέρα από τη μέτρηση. Για παράδειγμα, τώρα μπορείτε να στείλετε ζωτικής σημασίας πληροφορίες σε όλη την υδρόγειο με ένα μόνο κλικ του ποντικιού, χάρη στη συνδεσιμότητα στο διαδίκτυο. Δυστυχώς, είναι αυτή η ευρεία συνδεσιμότητα και δημοτικότητα μεταξύ των ανθρώπων, το διαδίκτυο έχει επίσης αυξήσει τις πιθανότητες για εγκλήματα στον υπολογιστή.<br/><br/>"Νόμοι για τον κυβερνοχώρο" είναι κάτι νέο στο δικαστικό σύστημα αλλά έχει κερδίσει πολλή προσοχή τον τελευταίο καιρό. Ο όρος κυβερνοέγκλημα είναι κάτι πολύ συνώνυμο με το συμβατικό έγκλημα, με μόνη διαφορά το μέσο εκτέλεσης. Υπάρχουν κατά κύριο λόγο δύο τύποι εγκλημάτων στον κυβερνοχώρο, το πρώτο είναι στο οποίο οι υπολογιστές είναι οι κύριοι στόχοι και αυτοί περιλαμβάνουν περιπτώσεις βλάβης δεδομένων, κακόβουλου κώδικα, ακόμη και πρόσβασης σε ποινικά δεδομένα. Το δεύτερο είναι στο οποίο ο υπολογιστής είναι μόνο ένα εργαλείο που χρησιμοποιεί το οποίο διαπράττονται συμβατικά εγκλήματα για π.χ. κυβερνοτρομοκρατία, spamming, καταδίωξη στον κυβερνοχώρο και πολλά άλλα.<br/><br/>Αν και δεν γνωρίζει όλους τους νόμους για τον κυβερνοχώρο που υπάρχουν μέχρι σήμερα, ένας προμηθευτής ιστοσελίδων μπορεί να σας συμβουλεύσει για μερικούς από τους πιο ζωτικούς νόμους για τον κυβερνοχώρο, δημιουργώντας παράλληλα τον ιστότοπό σας.<br/><br/>Αυτό μπορεί να περιλαμβάνει κοινή γνώση των δικαιωμάτων αντιγραφής ή ακόμα και την προστασία του περιεχομένου της δικής σας ιστοσελίδας. Εξηγώντας σας όλα τα δικαιώματα που κατέχετε ως ιδιοκτήτης της ιστοσελίδας είναι επίσης ένα από τα καθήκοντα που μπορεί να κάνει ένας προμηθευτής της ιστοσελίδας κατά την ανάπτυξη της ιστοσελίδας σας. Εκτός από όλα αυτά, ένας πωλητής μπορεί επίσης να σας προσφέρει πληροφορίες για κάθε νέο νόμο στον κυβερνοχώρο που μπορεί να μην γνωρίζετε. Οι νόμοι για τον κυβερνοχώρο μπορεί να διαφέρουν από έθνος σε έθνος, ένα πρόσφατο παράδειγμα μπορεί να είναι ο νόμος για τα cookies που κυκλοφόρησε στο Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο, ο οποίος εμποδίζει την αποθήκευση δεδομένων περιήγησης από τον ιστότοπο. Σύμφωνα με τον νόμο για τα cookies, οι ιστοσελίδες στο Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο δεν μπορούν να αποθηκεύσουν αρχεία cookies χωρίς την ενημερωτική συγκατάθεση του σέρφερ.<br/><br/>Μετά την εφαρμογή αυτού του νόμου, οι ιστοσελίδες έχουν πλέον αναδυόμενο παράθυρο, το οποίο ζητά τη συγκατάθεση του επισκέπτη για την αποθήκευση αρχείων cookies. Τέτοια αρχεία χρησιμοποιούνται από ιστοσελίδες για την ανάλυση του μοτίβου περιήγησης των επισκεπτών με βάση το ποιες διαφημίσεις στη συνέχεια αναρτώνται σε ένα παράθυρο χρήστη. Με το hacking να μην είναι πλέον κάτι νέο για όλους μας, πιστεύετε ότι τέτοιοι κανόνες και κανονισμοί μπορούν να αποτρέψουν την ηλεκτρονική πλαστογραφία ή το έγκλημα στον κυβερνοχώρο; Η τεχνολογία έχει αναπτυχθεί με γρήγορο ρυθμό αλλά ακόμα οι άνθρωποι δεν προτιμούν να ψωνίζουν online λόγω φόβου προσωπικών ή τραπεζικών στοιχείων να χακάρονται. Με την αύξηση του εγκλήματος στον κυβερνοχώρο, η ανάγκη για αυστηρούς νόμους στον κυβερνοχώρο έχει επίσης αυξηθεί για να περιορίσει το ίδιο και να προωθήσει μια εμπειρία αγορών χωρίς κίνδυνο.<br/><br/>Κλάσεις Εγκλημάτων στον Κυβερνοχώρο<br/><br/>Με τα χρόνια υπήρξαν τρεις μεγάλες κατηγορίες εγκλημάτων στον κυβερνοχώρο:<br/><br/>Μη εξουσιοδοτημένη πρόσβαση σε υποθέσεις υπολογιστικού συστήματος, η οποία περιλαμβάνει hacking ή κλοπή ονομάτων χρήστη και κωδικών πρόσβασης για να αποκτήσει πρόσβαση σε προσωπικές πληροφορίες του αντίστοιχου χρήστη. Αυτού του είδους η backdoor πρόσβαση οργανώνεται με τη βοήθεια του Trojan Horse. Απελευθερώνοντας κακόβουλα προγράμματα όπως το Trojan House, τα σκουλήκια ή τους ιούς υπολογιστών κ.λπ. Η τελευταία τάξη περιλαμβάνει τον κυβερνοπαρακολούθηση ενός χρήστη ή διαδικτυακή παρενόχληση .<br/><br/>Άμεσες επιπτώσεις των εγκλημάτων στον κυβερνοχώρο<br/><br/>Μείωση των πωλήσεων<br/><br/>Μείωση της εξόδου του προσωπικού λόγω καθυστερήσεων δικτύου<br/><br/>Απώλεια εξατομικευμένων πληροφοριών όπως η ερευνητική εργασία<br/><br/>Διαταραχή στη διαδικασία επικοινωνίας<br/><br/>Έμμεσες επιπτώσεις των εγκλημάτων στον κυβερνοχώρο<br/><br/>Θέμα αξιοπιστίας στο χρηματοπιστωτικό μας σύστημα<br/><br/>Η εικόνα του εμπορικού σήματος αμαυρώνεται στην αγορά<br/><br/>Τα εγκλήματα στον κυβερνοχώρο επηρεάζουν την επιχειρηματική σχέση στην αγορά<br/><br/>Η αίσθηση της εμπιστοσύνης στις κρατικές πολιτικές και τις κυβερνητικές υπηρεσίες χάνεται.<br/><br/>Πρόληψη του Κυβερνοεγκλήματος<br/><br/>Ως χρήστες του διαδικτύου υπάρχουν ορισμένες προφυλάξεις που θα πρέπει να εξετάσουμε για μια ασφαλή και ασφαλή διαδικτυακή εμπειρία.<br/><br/>Το πρώτο πράγμα που πρέπει να κάνετε είναι να κρατήσετε προσωπικές πληροφορίες για τον εαυτό σας και να αποφύγετε την κοινή χρήση των ίδιων στο διαδίκτυο.<br/><br/>Αποφεύγετε να μοιράζεστε φωτογραφίες με φίλους ή αγνώστους στο διαδίκτυο.<br/><br/>Η εγκατάσταση της τελευταίας έκδοσης του anti-virus στο σύστημά σας μπορεί να σας προσφέρει μια καλή γραμμή άμυνας ενάντια στις απειλές στο διαδίκτυο όπως οι ιοί και το κακόβουλο λογισμικό.<br/><br/>Κρατώντας αντίγραφα ασφαλείας των πολύτιμων δεδομένων σας είναι μια καλή επιλογή για την αποφυγή προβλημάτων όπως η μόλυνση από ιούς.<br/><br/>Αποφεύγετε την αποστολή στοιχείων πιστωτικής κάρτας σε ιστοσελίδες που δεν είναι εξασφαλισμένες και δεν έχουν κανένα έγκυρο πιστοποιητικό.<br/><br/>Εγκατάσταση προγράμματος ασφαλείας που σας προσφέρει τον έλεγχο των cookies του ιστότοπου και σας εξοικονομεί από την παρακολούθηση από ιστοσελίδες.<br/><br/>Η τοποθέτηση συσκευών ανίχνευσης εισβολών με βάση τον υπολογιστή στους διακομιστές θα σας βοηθήσει να παρακολουθείτε τις παρατυπίες στην κυκλοφορία της ιστοσελίδας σας.<br/><br/>Συνιστάται η χρήση τείχους προστασίας.<br/><br/>Γιατί οι κυβερνοεπιθέσεις είναι τόσο δημοφιλείς;<br/><br/>Φτηνότερες από τις παραδοσιακές μεθόδους εξαπάτησης<br/><br/>Η παρακολούθηση των εγκλημάτων στον κυβερνοχώρο δεν είναι εύκολη<br/><br/>Ακριβείς τοποθεσίες δεν μπορούν να εντοπιστούν εύκολα<br/><br/>Απουσία φυσικού φραγμού στον κόσμο του διαδικτύου<br/><br/>Τα εγκλήματα στον κυβερνοχώρο επηρεάζουν μεγάλο αριθμό ανθρώπων<br/><br/>Συμπέρασμα<br/><br/>Το γεγονός ότι ο ανθρώπινος νους έχει ανεξιχνίαστη δύναμη είναι αναμφισβήτητο, γι' αυτό και τα εγκλήματα στο διαδίκτυο αυξάνονται με τεράστιο ρυθμό. Ακόμη και η ιστορία έχει γίνει μάρτυρας μερικών από τους μεγαλύτερους σε ασφάλεια στο διαδίκτυο που έχουν πάει kaput από τα χέρια των χάκερ, οι οποίοι έχουν ξεφύγει εύκολα πάρα πολύ. Ο μόνος τρόπος για να περιορίσουμε ένα τέτοιο έγκλημα είναι να παραμείνουμε ενήμεροι για τους νόμους του κυβερνοχώρου που έχουμε σήμερα, που μπορεί να είναι είτε μέσω του διαδικτύου είτε μέσω των πωλητών ιστοσελίδων/IT. Ο νόμος για την τεχνολογία των πληροφοριών πρέπει να είναι ισορροπημένος με τέτοιο τρόπο ώστε να αποδεικνύεται υπερβολικά αυστηρός για τους ανθρώπους που εμπλέκονται σε εγκλήματα στον κυβερνοχώρο και ταυτόχρονα δεν πρέπει ποτέ να παρεμποδίζει την ανάπτυξη της βιομηχανίας του Διαδικτύου.<br/><br/>Author Bio:- Η Maneet Puri προς το παρόν είναι επικεφαλής μιας ποιοτικής εταιρείας σχεδιασμού ιστοσελίδων που βρίσκεται στο Νέο Δελχί της Ινδίας.
