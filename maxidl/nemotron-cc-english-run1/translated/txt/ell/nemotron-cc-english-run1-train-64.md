| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Μέσω της Βίβλου C2000 SeriesShall στρεφόμαστε στο βιβλίο των Πράξεων, κεφάλαιο πρώτο, καθώς αρχίζουμε τη μελέτη μας για την πρώιμη εκκλησία.<br/>Ο Λουκάς, ο συγγραφέας του βιβλίου των Πράξεων, σύντροφος του Παύλου του αποστόλου, ο οποίος ήταν επίσης συγγραφέας του Ευαγγελίου Σύμφωνα με τον Λουκά, έγραψε αυτές τις δύο πραγματείες σε έναν φίλο, τον Θεόφιλο. Ο Θεόφιλος είναι ελληνικό όνομα. Είναι ένα όνομα που έχει όμορφο νόημα. Το όνομα σημαίνει εραστής του Θεού. Υπάρχουν μερικοί που πιστεύουν ότι δεν ήταν άνθρωπος, αλλά ότι το ευαγγέλιο και το βιβλίο των Πράξεων απευθύνονταν στους λάτρεις του Θεού, όποιος κι αν είσαι. Υπάρχουν και άλλες παραδόσεις που λένε ότι ο Θεόφιλος ήταν στην πραγματικότητα ο αφέντης του Λουκά, ότι εκείνες τις μέρες οι γιατροί ήταν σκλάβοι, συνήθως δούλοι ενός πλούσιου προστάτη. Έτσι, ο κύριος του Λουκά ήταν ο Θεόφιλος, και απελευθέρωσε τον Λουκά για να είναι μαζί με τον Παύλο στα ιεραποστολικά ταξίδια. Αυτή είναι μια πρώιμη παράδοση της εκκλησίας, αλλά είναι, φυσικά, αδύνατο να αποδειχθεί, όπως τόσες πολλές από τις παραδόσεις.<br/>Υπάρχουν επίσης εκείνοι που πιστεύουν ότι όταν ο Παύλος ήταν στην Τρωάδα και έλαβε ένα όραμα ενός ανθρώπου που τον καλούσε λέγοντας, "Έλα στη Μακεδονία και βοήθησέ μας", ότι εκείνος ο άνθρωπος στο όραμα του Παύλου δεν ήταν άλλος από τον Λουκά. Διότι ο πρώτος που πραγματικά συνάντησε ο Παύλος όταν ήρθε στη Μακεδονία ήταν ο Λουκάς. Και όπως είμαστε στο βιβλίο των Πράξεων, θα διαπιστώσετε ότι όταν φτάσουμε σε εκείνο το τμήμα του βιβλίου των Πράξεων, ο Λουκάς αρχίζει να γράφει περισσότερο στο πρώτο πρόσωπο παρά στο τρίτο πρόσωπο. Έτσι είναι, προφανώς, στο συγκεκριμένο σημείο των Πράξεων των Αποστόλων που ο Λουκάς έγινε σύντροφος του Παύλου και άρχισε να ταξιδεύει μαζί του. Άρχισε να χρησιμοποιεί τις αντωνυμίες "εμείς" και "εμάς" αντί για "αυτοί" και "αυτοί". Αυτό είναι, χωρίς αμφιβολία, όπου ο Λουκ έγινε συμμετέχων και αυτόπτης μάρτυρας αυτών των πραγμάτων που συνέβαιναν από αυτό το σημείο και μετά.<br/>Αρχίζει τις Πράξεις των Αποστόλων δένοντάς τις με το Ευαγγέλιο Σύμφωνα με τον Λουκά.Είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι το τελευταίο πράγμα που καταγράφει ο Λουκάς στο ευαγγέλιο του είναι το πρώτο πράγμα που καταγράφει στις Πράξεις των Αποστόλων. Βρίσκουμε το ευαγγέλιο του Λουκά να κλείνει καθώς ο Ιησούς λέει στους μαθητές Του να περιμένουν στην Ιερουσαλήμ μέχρι να τους προσφερθεί δύναμη από ψηλά. Και τότε ο Ιησούς ανέβηκε στον ουρανό, και έτσι κλείνει το ευαγγέλιο. Ανοίγει τις Πράξεις των Αποστόλων, γράφει,<br/>Η προηγούμενη πραγματεία [δηλαδή το Ευαγγέλιο κατά Λουκά,] σας έγραψα, ω Θεόφιλε, από όλα όσα ο Ιησούς άρχισε τόσο να κάνει όσο και να διδάσκει (Πράξ. 1:1 ),<br/>Αρχίζει η λέξη κλειδί. Το Ευαγγέλιο Σύμφωνα με τον Λουκά δεν είναι η πλήρης ιστορία της διακονίας του Ιησού Χριστού. Είναι μόνο η αρχή της διακονίας του Ιησού Χριστού. Ο Ιησούς συνεχίζει να υπηρετεί τις ανάγκες των ανθρώπων. Ο Ιησούς συνεχίζει να θεραπεύει τους αρρώστους. Ο Ιησούς συνεχίζει να διακονεί την αγάπη Του και το ευαγγέλιο Του στον κόσμο, μόνο που τώρα διακονεί μέσω εκείνων των μαθητών που έχουν χριστεί με το Άγιο Πνεύμα Του. Αλλά η διακονία του Χριστού συνεχίζεται· βασικά, είναι η υπόθεση που παίρνει ο Λουκάς στις Πράξεις των Αποστόλων. Η προηγούμενη πραγματεία όλων όσων ξεκίνησε ο Ιησούς, τόσο για να κάνει όσο και για να διδάξει.<br/>Τώρα εξαιτίας αυτού, οι Πράξεις των Αποστόλων είναι ένα ημιτελές βιβλίο: στο ότι ο Κύριος σήμερα συνεχίζει να εργάζεται μέσα από τη ζωή εκείνων που έχουν αφιερωθεί να είναι τα όργανα του Θεού. Να οδηγηθεί και να καθοδηγηθεί και να χριστεί από το Άγιο Πνεύμα Του, να συνεχίσει τη διακονία του Ιησού στον κόσμο σήμερα. Τώρα ο Θεός έχει χειροτονήσει ότι το έργο Του πρέπει να επιτελεστεί μέσω ανθρώπινων οργάνων. Δεν λέω ότι πρέπει να επιτελεστεί. Ο Θεός μπορεί να χρησιμοποιήσει αγγελικά όντα για το έργο Του, και θα έρθει κάποια στιγμή, κατά τη διάρκεια του βιβλίου της Αποκάλυψης, όταν ο Θεός θα χρησιμοποιήσει αγγέλους για να διακηρύξει το ευαγγέλιο Του στους ανθρώπους σε όλο τον κόσμο. Αποκάλυψη, κεφάλαιο 14, «Ο πρώτος άγγελος που πετάει μέσα από το μέσον του ουρανού έχοντας το αιώνιο ευαγγέλιο» (Αποκ. 14:6). Αλλά αυτή τη στιγμή, ο Θεός έχει επιλέξει να χρησιμοποιεί ανθρώπινα όργανα. Όσο ατελείς κι αν είναι, ωστόσο αυτό είναι που ο Θεός έχει ορίσει να χρησιμοποιεί. Το συναρπαστικό σε αυτό είναι ότι ο Θεός θα με χρησιμοποιήσει και ο Θεός θα σε χρησιμοποιήσει. Τόσες φορές, ικετεύουμε, "Ω Κύριε, δεν μπορώ να μιλήσω. Ποτέ δεν μπόρεσα να μιλήσω πριν ή ακόμα και τώρα, Κύριε." Καθώς ο Μωυσής προσπάθησε να ικετέψει από το κάλεσμα του Θεού. Ο Ιερεμίας είπε, "Κύριε, είμαι απλά ένα παιδί· κανείς δεν πρόκειται να με ακούσει." Και όλοι έχουμε τις δικαιολογίες μας γιατί δεν μπορούμε να χρησιμοποιήσουμε. Έτσι δεν είναι; Όλοι γνωρίζουμε τους λόγους για τους οποίους ο Θεός δεν μπορούσε να μας χρησιμοποιήσει.<br/>Μια φορά, καθώς ο Κύριος καλούσε έναν προφήτη να κάνει το έργο Του, είπε, «Κύριε, στείλε όποιον θέλεις». Ο Κύριος είπε, «Ε, σε κάλεσα». «Κύριε, καλή ιδέα· στείλε όποιον θέλεις». Τόσο συχνά είμαστε σε αυτή τη θέση, "Κύριε, στείλε από το χέρι όποιον θέλεις, οποιονδήποτε εκτός από μένα Κύριε." Και όμως, ο Θεός έχει χειροτονήσει να μας χρησιμοποιήσει.<br/>Τώρα, ο καθένας μας μπορεί να δείξει τις δικές του ατέλειες, ο καθένας μας μπορεί να επισημάνει τις δικές του αδυναμίες, και όλοι μας μπορούμε να βρούμε μια δικαιολογία γιατί ο Θεός δεν θα ήθελε να με χρησιμοποιήσει, αλλά ακόμα, ο Θεός επέλεξε να σε χρησιμοποιήσει. Αναρωτιέσαι πότε ο Θεός έχει τέτοια όργανα για να χρησιμοποιήσει πώς έκανε ποτέ τη δουλειά, έτσι δεν είναι;<br/>Μέχρι την ημέρα κατά την οποία αναλήφθηκε, μετά από αυτό αυτός μέσω του Αγίου Πνεύματος είχε δώσει εντολές στους αποστόλους τους οποίους είχε επιλέξει (Πράξ. 1:2 ):<br/>Την ημέρα που αναλήφθηκε ο Ιησούς, αφού είχε πει στους αποστόλους να περιμένουν το χάρισμα της εξουσίας.<br/>Σε ποιον επίσης [δηλαδή τους αποστόλους έδειξε τον εαυτό του ζωντανό σε αυτούς μετά από το πάθος του [ή το θάνατό του] με πολλές αλάνθαστες αποδείξεις (Πράξ. 1:3),<br/>Είναι δύσκολο να αρνηθώ το γεγονός της ανάστασης του Ιησού Χριστού. Διασκεδάστηκα, καθώς και ενοχλημένος και εκνευρισμένος, από ένα άρθρο που διάβασα στο Μητρώο Σάντα Άνα το προηγούμενο Σάββατο. Για την επιστήμη της δημιουργίας και τις εξελικτικές θεωρίες που παρουσιάζονται στα σχολεία της κομητείας Πώς αυτό, αυτός ο ένας καθηγητής είπε ότι διδάσκει ένα μάθημα επιστήμης, και έτσι, ασχολούνται μόνο με τα γεγονότα, και ότι δεν έχουν θέση για θεωρίες. Επειδή η επιστήμη βασίζεται σε γεγονότα και η δημιουργία βασίζεται σε θρησκευτικές δεισιδαιμονίες. Χρειάζεται πολλή πίστη για να πιστέψει κανείς τις θρησκευτικές θεωρίες. Σκέφτηκα, "Πολύ ενδιαφέρον σε εκείνο το μάθημα επιστήμης, μου έμαθαν ότι ήταν γεγονός ότι ο κόσμος ήταν τεσσάρων δισεκατομμυρίων ετών. Τώρα σήμερα διδάσκουν ότι είναι γεγονός ότι ο κόσμος είναι δώδεκα δισεκατομμυρίων ετών. Και δεν πέρασε τόσος καιρός από τότε που πήγα στο σχολείο».<br/>Είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι η Αγία Γραφή δεν χρειάστηκε ποτέ να αναθεωρηθεί ή να ενημερωθεί για να ανταποκριθεί στα τρέχοντα δεδομένα που έχουν ανακαλύψει οι άνθρωποι. Και όμως, αν παίρνατε σήμερα τα σχολικά βιβλία μου για τις επιστήμες του γυμνασίου και προσπαθούσατε να διδάξετε μια τάξη επιστημών από αυτά, θα διαπιστώνατε ότι πολλά από τα πράγματα που διδάσκονταν ως επιστημονικό γεγονός όταν ήμουν στο γυμνάσιο δεν αναγνωρίζονται πλέον ως επιστημονικό γεγονός. Το απλό κυτταρικό πρωτόπλασμα δεν είναι πλέον ένα απλό κύτταρο, αλλά εξαιρετικά πολύπλοκο. Αν υπάρχει κάποιο γεγονός που μπορεί να πιστοποιηθεί στην ιστορία είναι το γεγονός της ανάστασης του Ιησού Χριστού από τους νεκρούς.<br/>Έχουμε ένα σύστημα νομολογίας που βασίζεται στη μαρτυρία μαρτύρων. Αν ένας άνθρωπος κατηγορείται για ένα έγκλημα και υπάρχουν άνθρωποι που ήταν μάρτυρες αυτού του εγκλήματος ενώ διαπράττονταν, και φέρονται σύμφωνα με το πρότυπο, και ορκίζονται να πουν την αλήθεια, όλη την αλήθεια, και τίποτα άλλο εκτός από την αλήθεια, γι' αυτό βοηθήστε τους τον Θεό. Και στην ανάκρισή τους βεβαιώνουν ότι, "Είδα εκείνον τον άνθρωπο στην τράπεζα στις 20 Μαΐου. Τον είδα να βγάζει ένα όπλο από το παλτό του. Τον άκουσα να απαιτεί να του δοθούν όλα τα χρήματα. Τον είδα καθώς έφευγε από την τράπεζα. Τον είδα καθώς ο αξιωματικός τον συνέλαβε έξω. " Και αν μπορείτε να πάρετε τρεις ή τέσσερις μάρτυρες για να δείξει σε αυτόν τον άνθρωπο και θα κρατήσει τη μαρτυρία τους υπό αντεξέταση, ότι ο άνθρωπος κρίνεται ως ένοχος. Αυτός είναι που το έκανε. Έχουμε δύο ή τρεις μάρτυρες που καταθέτουν την ίδια ιστορία για εκείνον τον άνθρωπο, και γίνεται αποδεκτό ως γεγονός ότι αυτός διέπραξε το έγκλημα και είναι ένοχος.<br/>Μετά τον θάνατο του Ιησού, όταν αναστήθηκε και πάλι, εμφανίστηκε σε πολλούς διαφορετικούς ανθρώπους που έδωσαν ένορκη μαρτυρία ότι τον είδαν. Ότι του μίλησαν, ότι εμφανίστηκε σε αυτούς σε διάφορα μέρη κάτω από διαφορετικές συνθήκες. Και για μια περίοδο σαράντα ημερών επισκεπτόταν μαζί τους και κάποτε, μέχρι και πεντακόσιους ανθρώπους που ήταν συγκεντρωμένοι σε ένα μέρος, εμφανίστηκε. Είναι δύσκολο να παραμερίσεις ή να αρνηθείς τη μαρτυρία αυτών των ανθρώπων. Το να το κάνουμε αυτό είναι να δυσφημίσουμε ολόκληρο το δικαστικό μας σύστημα. Αλλά όχι μόνο αυτό, οι άνδρες αυτοί που μαρτυρούσαν ότι είδαν τον αναστημένο Κύριο, ότι μίλησαν σ' Αυτόν, ότι έφαγαν μαζί Του, αλλά, όλοι τους, με εξαίρεση έναν, συνάντησαν βίαιους θανάτους στα χέρια άλλων ανθρώπων λόγω της βεβαιώσεώς τους ότι η ιστορία που έλεγαν ήταν αληθινή. Μιλάς για μάρτυρες που ορκίστηκαν να πουν την αλήθεια, όλη την αλήθεια, τίποτα άλλο παρά την αλήθεια. Θα ομολογούσαν σε όλη την φάρσα. "Έδειξε τον εαυτό του ζωντανό μετά το πάθος Του από πολλές αλάνθαστες αποδείξεις."<br/>ιδού εξ αυτών επί σαράντα ημέρες, λαλών προς αυτούς περί των περί της βασιλείας του Θεού (Πράξ. 1:3) :<br/>Ας ενθυμούμεθα ότι η βασιλεία του Θεού ήταν το αγαπημένο θέμα του Ιησού Χριστού. Μιλούσε πάντοτε για τη βασιλεία του Θεού, και είναι μεγάλη ελπίδα το ότι φύτευε στις καρδιές όλων των ανθρώπων. Ο κόσμος δεν πρόκειται να πάει για πάντα κάτω από τη δύναμη του σκότους, κάτω από τη δουλεία του κακού. Ο Θεός πρόκειται μια μέρα να εγκαθιδρύσει τη βασιλεία Του πάνω στη γη. Μια βασιλεία δίκαιης χαράς και ειρήνης. "Ο Ιησούς θα βασιλεύσει, όπου πριν ο ήλιος κάνει τα διαδοχικά ταξίδια του και η βασιλεία Του θα εκτείνεται από ακτή σε ακτή." Και εκείνη η ημέρα θα είναι η πιο ένδοξη ημέρα που έχει δει ποτέ ο κόσμος, καθώς η αρρώστια και τα βάσανα και ο πόνος θα καταργηθούν στη βασιλεία Του. καθώς η αμαρτία και η απληστία και αυτά τα πράγματα που έχουν κάνει τον κόσμο έναν τόσο ανυπόφορο τόπο θα καταργηθούν στη βασιλεία Του. Η άθεη εμπορευματοποίηση, η εκμετάλλευση του ανθρώπου, όλα αυτά τα πράγματα καταργήθηκαν στο ένδοξο βασίλειό Του όταν βασιλεύει. Δεν απορώ που οι μαθητές ανυπομονούσαν να το ανεβάσουν. Ανυπομονώ να το ανεβάσω· ανυπομονώ να έρθει το βασίλειό Του. Και ο Ιησούς μας είπε όταν προσευχόμαστε, η πρώτη παράκληση είναι, «Ελθέτω η βασιλεία σου· το θέλημά σου να γίνει στη γη, όπως είναι στον ουρανό» (Ματθ. 6:10). Αυτό είναι το σωστό είδος επιθυμίας που πρέπει να έχουμε όλοι. Επιθυμώ τη βασιλεία του Θεού. Και έτσι τους μιλούσε, στη διάρκεια αυτής της τεσσαρακοστής ημέρας, της βασιλείας.<br/>Και αφού συγκεντρώθηκε μαζί τους, τους πρόσταξε να μην απομακρυνθούν από την Ιερουσαλήμ, αλλά να περιμένουν την υπόσχεση του Πατέρα, η οποία, λέει ο ίδιος, έχετε ακούσει για μένα (Πράξεις 1:4 ).<br/>Είπε, "Τώρα κοίτα, περίμενε εδώ στην Ιερουσαλήμ μέχρι να λάβεις την υπόσχεση του Πατέρα". Αυτή η υπόσχεση στην οποία αναφέρεται είναι, χωρίς αμφιβολία, η υπόσχεση στον Ιωήλ όπου ο Κύριος υποσχέθηκε, "Και στις τελευταίες ημέρες, λέει ο Κύριος, ότι θα εκχύσω το Πνεύμα μου πάνω σε κάθε σάρκα· και οι γιοι και οι θυγατέρες σου θα προφητεύσουν, και οι νέοι σου θα ονειρεύονται, οι γέροντες σου θα δουν οράματα: και πάνω στους υπηρέτες μου και στις υπηρέτριες μου θα εκχύσω το Πνεύμα μου, λέει ο Κύριος (Ιω 2:28)." (Ιω 2:28). Η υπόσχεση του Πατέρα: η ημέρα πρόκειται να έρθει όταν ο Θεός πρόκειται να εκχύσει το Πνεύμα Του πάνω σε κάθε σάρκα, σε όλους τους πιστούς.<br/>Διότι ο Ιωάννης [Είπε,] αληθινά βαπτισμένος με νερό· αλλά θα βαπτιστείς με το Άγιο Πνεύμα όχι πολλές ημέρες από τώρα (Πράξ. 1:5 ).<br/>Η ιδέα της βάπτισης ήταν αυτή της εμψύχωσης, του μπαπτήτζου. Ο Ιωάννης βάπτισε με νερό, βύθισε τους ανθρώπους στο νερό, "θα βυθιστείς στο Άγιο Πνεύμα σε όχι πολλές ημέρες."<br/>Και όταν συνήλθαν, λοιπόν, τον ρώτησαν, λέγοντας: Κύριε, θα αποκαταστήσεις αυτή τη στιγμή τη βασιλεία στον Ισραήλ; (Πράξ. 1:6)<br/>"Πότε θα γίνει, Κύριε; Πότε είναι ο καιρός για αυτή την αποκατάσταση;" Και ο Ιησούς τους μιλάει τώρα, όχι για τη βασιλεία, αλλά για τη δύναμη που πρόκειται να λάβουν για υπηρεσία.<br/>Λέγοντάς τους, δεν είναι για σας να γνωρίζετε τους χρόνους ή τις εποχές, που ο Πατέρας έχει θέσει στη δική του δύναμη (Πράξ. 1:7 ).<br/>"Δεν είναι για σας να ξέρετε." Ζούσαν συνεχώς στην αναμονή της άμεσης δημιουργίας της βασιλείας. Σε όλη τη διάρκεια της ζωής του Ιησού, Τον περίμεναν ανά πάσα στιγμή να πάει στον τηλεφωνικό θάλαμο και να βγει ως ο σωτήρας του κόσμου. Shazzam! Δείχνοντας τη δύναμή Του και ανατρέποντας τις κυβερνήσεις του κόσμου, ιδρύοντας τη βασιλεία του Θεού πάνω στη γη. Και περίμεναν καθημερινά αυτή την αλλαγή να εκδηλωθεί. Και όποτε ο Ιησούς μιλούσε για να πάει στην Ιερουσαλήμ, να παραδοθεί στα χέρια του αμαρτωλού ανθρώπου, και στη συνέχεια να σταυρωθεί, "Ω, ω, όχι, Κύριε. Όχι, δεν καταλαβαίνεις τη βασιλεία, Κύριε. Όταν ο Ιησούς πέθανε στο σταυρό, όλοι απογοητεύτηκαν πολύ.<br/>Οι δύο μαθητές στο δρόμο για τον Εμμαούς, τόσο λυπημένοι. "Γεια σας, παιδιά. Πώς και είστε τόσο λυπημένοι όσο το περπάτημα σας;" "Τι εννοείτε; Πρέπει να είστε ένας ξένος εδώ γύρω αν δεν γνωρίζετε τα πράγματα που συμβαίνουν τελευταία στην Ιερουσαλήμ." "Τι πράγματα;" "Ω, ένας άνθρωπος με το όνομα Ιησούς από τη Ναζαρέτ...ω άνθρωπος, ήταν ισχυρός και ισχυρός. Το χρίσμα του Θεού ήταν πάνω στη ζωή Του. Ελπίζαμε ότι σε Αυτόν ήταν η απελευθέρωση του Ισραήλ, αλλά Τον σταύρωσαν. Ελπίζαμε . . . τώρα είναι νεκρό." Τώρα αναστήθηκε, και λέει, "Σε λίγες μέρες, παιδιά, θα λάβετε την υπόσχεση του Πατέρα." "Ω, τι υπόσχεση; Η υπόσχεση για την ίδρυση της βασιλείας;" Βλέπετε, ήταν νόμιμο να ρωτήσουν. "Αυτό είναι Κύριε; Εντάξει! Είναι αυτή η ώρα; Σκοπεύετε να ιδρύσετε τη βασιλεία σας τώρα; «Όχι. Δεν είναι για σας να γνωρίζετε εκείνους τους χρόνους που έχει διορίσει ο Πατέρας ή που έχει ο Πατέρας με τη δική του δύναμη. Αλλά, θα λάβετε δύναμη όταν το Άγιο Πνεύμα έρθει πάνω σας».<br/>Τώρα εδώ, η ελληνική επιτομή προθέσεως χρησιμοποιείται για να υποδηλώσει μια νέα σχέση που επρόκειτο να έχουν με το Άγιο Πνεύμα. Στο Ευαγγέλιο Σύμφωνα με τον Ιωάννη, κεφάλαιο 14, καθώς ο Ιησούς είναι εκεί υποσχόμενος να στείλει το Άγιο Πνεύμα, είπε, «Δεν θα σας αφήσω χωρίς παρηγοριά. Θα έρθω σε σένα, και θα προσευχηθώ στον Πατέρα, και θα σου στείλει έναν άλλο παρηγορητή, το Πνεύμα της Αλήθειας που ο κόσμος δεν μπορεί να λάβει, επειδή δεν Τον βλέπει ούτε Τον γνωρίζει, αλλά Τον γνωρίζεις γιατί κατοικεί μαζί σου, και θα είναι μέσα σου» (Ιωα 14:17-18 ). Ίδια ελληνική πρόθεση με τη δική μας, μόνο που τη γράφουν "εν" αντί για "εν". Διπλή σχέση εκεί στον Ιωάννη: Είναι μαζί σου, αλλά πρόκειται να κατοικεί μέσα σου. Αλλά τώρα ο Ιησούς είπε ότι θα λάβεις δύναμη όταν το Άγιο Πνεύμα έρθει πάνω σου. Η ελληνική επιτομή της προθέσεως, η οποία μεταφράζεται σε διαφορετικά κείμενα σε όλη την Καινή Διαθήκη ως "πάνω" ή "πάνω" ή μου αρέσει, "υπερχείλιση".<br/>Στο έβδομο κεφάλαιο του ευαγγελίου του Ιωάννη: «Την τελευταία ημέρα, τη μεγάλη ημέρα του συμποσίου όταν ο Ιησούς στεκόταν εκεί στο Όρος του Ναού και φώναζε στο λαό, «Αν κάποιος διψάσει ας έρθει σε μένα και ας πιει: και αυτός που πίνει από το νερό που δίνω, από το εσώτατο ον του εκεί θα αναβλύσει χείμαρροι ζωντανού νερού». Ο Ιωάννης είπε, «Αυτός ο λόγος του Πνεύματος, που δεν δόθηκε ακόμη τον οποίο εκείνοι που πιστεύουν σε Αυτόν πρέπει να λάβουν» (Ιωα 7:37-39 ). Τι μίλησε για το Πνεύμα; Ότι θα ήταν σαν χείμαρρος από ζωντανό νερό που ρέει έξω. Μου αρέσει, "Όταν το Πνεύμα σε υπερχειλίζει", πάνω σου, ή πάνω σου, ή υπερχειλίζει από εσένα. Έτσι η τριπλή σχέση: Αυτός είναι μαζί σας πριν από τη μεταστροφή σας, Αυτός είναι αυτός που σας κάνει να συνειδητοποιήσετε ότι είστε αμαρτωλός, Αυτός είναι αυτός που δείχνει τον Ιησού Χριστό ως την απάντηση καθώς πείθει τον κόσμο της αμαρτίας, των δικαίων και της κρίσης. Τη στιγμή που θα ανοίξεις τη ζωή και την καρδιά σου στον Ιησού Χριστό και θα Τον καλέσεις να μπει μέσα, το Άγιο Πνεύμα έρχεται και αρχίζει να σε ενοικεί. "Γνωρίζετε ότι δεν είστε δικοί σας, έχετε αγοραστεί με τιμή, γι' αυτό δοξάστε τον Θεό στο σώμα σας και το πνεύμα σας που είναι δικό Του. Και δεν γνωρίζετε ότι το σώμα σας είναι ο ναός του Αγίου Πνεύματος που είναι μέσα σας; Να μη μεθύσετε με κρασί, όπου υπάρχει υπερβολή, αλλά να γεμίσετε, ή να γεμίσετε με το Πνεύμα» ( 1Κο 6:19-20 , Εφ 5:18 ). Αλλά τώρα εδώ είναι μια τρίτη σχέση. Αυτή είναι μια ενδυναμωτική εμπειρία.<br/>Θα λάβετε [τον δούναμο] τη δυναμική, όταν το Άγιο Πνεύμα έρθει πάνω σας [ή πάνω σας, ή όταν υπάρχει εκείνη η υπερχείλιση από εσάς]· και θα είστε μάρτυρες σε μένα (Πράξ. 1:8 )<br/>Και έτσι η δυναμική, να είμαστε μάρτυρες για τον Ιησού Χριστό. Είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι η λέξη μάρτυς στα ελληνικά είναι η λέξη μάρτυς από όπου παίρνουμε τη λέξη μάρτυς. Και στα ελληνικά σημαίνει μάρτυς. Μάρτυρας είναι αυτός που όχι μόνο διακηρύσσει αυτό που πιστεύει, ζει αυτό που πιστεύει, είναι αυτό που πιστεύει, και το πιστεύει τόσο έντονα, που αν χρειαστεί, θα πεθάνει για αυτό που πιστεύει. Δεν μπορείς να τον σταματήσεις, δεν φοβάται να πεθάνει για ό,τι πιστεύει.<br/>Θυμάστε όταν ο Παύλος επέστρεφε στην Ιερουσαλήμ και ο Αγάβος κατέβηκε από την Καισάρεια και πήρε τη ζώνη του Παύλου και έδεσε τον εαυτό του και είπε, "Έτσι είναι ο άνθρωπος που κατέχει αυτή τη ζώνη για να δεθεί όταν φτάσει στην Ιερουσαλήμ." Και οι φίλοι του Πωλ άρχισαν να κλαίνε, λέγοντας, "Ω, Πωλ, μην πας, μην πας." Και είπε, "Τι εννοείς με αυτά τα δάκρυα; Νομίζεις ότι πρόκειται να με αποθαρρύνεις; Νομίζεις ότι ανησυχώ για το δέσιμο; Είμαι έτοιμος να πεθάνω". Ήταν ένας μάρτος. "Είμαι έτοιμος να πεθάνω." Το να θανατωθείς για την πίστη σου δεν σε έκανε μάρτυρα· επειδή ήσουν μάρτυρας, θανατώθηκες. Επειδή ήσουν μάρτυρας, επειδή το πίστευες τόσο δυνατά. Έτσι, δεν σε έκανε μάρτυρα, αποδείκνυε μόνο αυτό που ήσουν. Ήσουν μάρτυρας από την αρχή. Αν δεν ήσουν μάρτος, δεν θα είχες πάει ποτέ στο θάνατό σου. Θα είχες ανακληθεί· θα είχες πει, "Ουάου, ουάου, περίμενε, περίμενε. Στάσου, ας αλλάξουμε πορεία εδώ. Νομίζω ότι μπορεί να έκανα λάθος. " Τότε λέτε, "Δεν ήταν μάρτος. Το να κλέβεις ένα άλογο δεν σε κάνει κλέφτη αλόγων. Αποδεικνύει μόνο ότι ήσουν. Κανείς δεν κλέβει ένα άλογο εκτός αν είναι κλέφτης αλόγων. Έτσι, το να το κλέψεις δεν σε κάνει αλογοκλέφτη, αποδεικνύει μόνο ότι ήσουν από την αρχή. Το να είσαι μάρτυρας αποδεικνύει μόνο αυτό που ήσουν μάρτυρας, ένας μάρτος. "Και θα είστε μάρτυρες." Και δεν είναι ενδιαφέρον που οι περισσότεροι από αυτούς μαρτύρησαν; "Μάρτυρες προς Εμένα."<br/>Η μαρτυρία επρόκειτο να είναι και στην Ιερουσαλήμ, και σε όλη την Ιουδαία (Πράξεις 1:8 ),<br/>Η μαρτυρία ξεκίνησε από το σπίτι, το πιο δύσκολο μέρος, έτσι δεν είναι; Είναι να ξεκινήσεις από το σπίτι στην Ιερουσαλήμ, και μετά την περιοχή γύρω από την Ιερουσαλήμ, την περιοχή της Ιουδαίας. Και τότε επρόκειτο να εξέλθει στα έσχατα μέρη του κόσμου και καθώς μελετούμε το βιβλίο των Πράξεων, θα δούμε αυτή ακριβώς την εξέλιξη. Πώς ξεκίνησε η μαρτυρία στην Ιερουσαλήμ. Θα το πάρουμε αυτό στο επόμενο κεφάλαιο. Και τότε θα δούμε πώς άρχισε να εξαπλώνεται μέσα από την Ιουδαία και μετά ο Φίλιππος ανέβηκε στη Σαμάρεια, και τελικά ο Παύλος και ο Βαρνάβας καλούνται να πάνε στα πιο ακραία μέρη του κόσμου. Και έτσι η μαρτυρία διαδόθηκε μέσω του χρίσματος και της ενδυνάμωσης του Αγίου Πνεύματος.<br/>Και όταν είπε αυτά τα πράγματα, ενώ έβλεπαν, τον σήκωσαν· και ένα σύννεφο τον πήρε από τα μάτια τους (Πράξεις 1:9 ).<br/>Αυτή είναι η τελική υπόσχεση που έδωσε ο Ιησούς στους μαθητές Του. Αυτό είναι, τα τελευταία λόγια πριν από την ανάληψή Του. Φυσικά, αργότερα ήρθε και μίλησε στον Παύλο και σε άλλους, αλλά πριν από την ανάληψή Του, αυτή είναι η τελική Του λέξη. Και επάνω σ' αυτό, όταν είχε πει αυτά τα πράγματα, ενώ Τον παρακολουθούσαν, Τον σήκωσαν και ένα σύννεφο τον πήρε από τα μάτια τους.<br/>Και ενώ απέβλεπαν σταθερά προς τον ουρανό καθώς ανέβαινε, ιδού, ήταν δύο άνδρες που στάθηκαν δίπλα τους με λευκά ενδύματα (Πράξεις 1:10 )·<br/>Υποθέτουμε ότι ήταν άγγελοι.<br/>Ο οποίος επίσης είπε, Άνδρες της Γαλιλαίας, γιατί στέκεστε ατενίζοντας στον ουρανό; Αυτός ο ίδιος ο Ιησούς, που αναλαμβάνεται από εσάς στον ουρανό, θα έρθει έτσι με τον ίδιο τρόπο όπως τον είδατε να πηγαίνει στον ουρανό (Πράξ. 1:11).<br/>Τον είδαν καθώς ανέβαινε στον ουρανό και θα Τον βλέπουν όταν θα έρχεται ξανά. "Ιδού ο Κύριος έρχεται μαζί με δέκα χιλιάδες αγίους Του, για να εκτελέσει κρίση πάνω στη γη" (Κριτ 1:14-15). Και τότε, «Εις Αυτόν, όστις ηγάπησεν ημάς και εδόθη υπέρ ημών και έπλασεν ημάς εις τον Θεόν ημών, βασιλείς και ιερείς, οίτινες θέλουσι βασιλεύσει μετ' αυτού επί της γης, ιδού έρχεται ο Κύριος, και θέλει ιδεί Αυτόν παν οφθαλμόν, και οι διατρυπώμενοι αυτόν θέλουσι θρηνήσει» Αποκ. 1:5-7 ). Έτσι έρχεται ο Κύριος. Κάθε μάτι θα Τον δει. Οι Μάρτυρες του Ιεχωβά λένε ότι Αυτός έχει ήδη έρθει, αλλά ήταν ένας κρυφός ερχομός. Καθώς μόνο οι μαθητές Τον είδαν να φεύγει, ήταν μόνο οι μαθητές, των Μαρτύρων του Ιεχωβά, που Τον είδαν να επιστρέφει. Ο Ιησούς όμως είπε: «Αν σου πουν: “Αυτός ήρθε στα κρυφά και μπήκε σε ένα μυστικό θάλαμο, μην το πιστεύεις”» (Ματθ. 24:26).<br/>"Αυτός ο ίδιος Ιησούς που αναλαμβάνεται από εσάς στον ουρανό, θα έρθει έτσι με τον ίδιο τρόπο όπως τον είδατε να πηγαίνει στον ουρανό."<br/>Τώρα υπάρχει ένας πολύ ενδιαφέρων στίχος στη Β' Ιωάννου, στίχος Πράξη 1:7 , "Διότι πολλοί απατεώνες εισήλθαν στον κόσμο που δεν ομολογούν ότι ο Ιησούς Χριστός ήρθε με σάρκα". Αυτό, δυστυχώς, είναι μια κακή μετάφραση της ελληνικής. Διότι αυτή η συμμετοχή βρίσκεται στον παρόντα χρόνο και θα πρέπει να μεταφραστεί «έρχεται εν σαρκί». Εκείνοι που θα αρνούνταν ότι ο Ιησούς Χριστός έρχεται εν σαρκί. Τι λέει ο Ιωάννης για αυτούς; «Είναι απατεώνας και αντίχριστος. Αποβλέπετε εις εαυτούς, να μη απολέσωμεν τα όσα εποίησαμεν, αλλά να λάβωμεν πλήρην αμοιβήν· διότι όστις αμαρτάνει και δεν μένει εν τη διδαχή του Χριστού, δεν έχει Θεόν. Αυτός που μένει στο δόγμα του Χριστού, έχει και τον Πατέρα και τον Υιό. Και αν έρθει κάποιος στην πόρτα σου (το πρωί του Σαββάτου) και δεν φέρει αυτό το δόγμα, μην τον δεχτείς στο σπίτι σου, και μην τον αποχαιρετήσεις. Διότι αυτός που τον αποχαιρετά είναι μετέχων των κακών του πράξεων» (2Ιω. 1:7-11). Κάντε τους μια ερώτηση, «Έρχεται ο Ιησούς με σάρκα;» Απλά κάντε τους αυτή την ερώτηση. Και αν πουν όχι, απλά να θυμάστε τι σας προειδοποίησε ο Ιωάννης και τι σας είπε ο Ιωάννης. "Αν κάποιος δεν ομολογήσει ότι ο Ιησούς Χριστός έρχεται με σάρκα." Θυμάστε όταν ήταν μαζί με τους μαθητές και είπε, "Δώσε μου κάτι να φάω;" Είπε, "Ξέρεις, τα πνεύματα δεν τρώνε· άγγιξέ με. Έτσι, αυτός ο ίδιος Ιησούς έρχεται και πάλι με τον ίδιο τρόπο με τον οποίο τον είδαν να πηγαίνει στον ουρανό.<br/>Κατόπιν επανασυντόνισαν στην Ιερουσαλήμ από το όρος που ονομάζεται Ολιβέ, το οποίο είναι από την Ιερουσαλήμ ταξίδι της ημέρας του Σαββάτου [περίπου τα δύο τρίτα του μιλίου]. Και όταν μπήκαν, ανέβηκαν σε ένα ανώγειο, όπου κατοικούσαν και ο Πέτρος, και ο Ιάκωβος, και ο Ιωάννης, και ο Ανδρέας, και ο Φίλιππος, και ο Θωμάς, και ο Βαρθολομαίος, και ο Ματθαίος, ο Ιάκωβος ο γιος του Αλφειού, και ο Σίμων ο Ζηλωτής, και ο Ιούδας ο αδελφός του Ιακώβ. Και όλα αυτά συνεχίστηκαν σε μια συμφωνία με προσευχή και δέηση, με τις γυναίκες, και με τη Μαρία τη μητέρα του Ιησού, και με τους αδελφούς του (Πράξεις 1:12-14 ).<br/>Αυτή είναι η τελευταία αναφορά της Μαρίας της μητέρας του Ιησού. Σε αυτό το σημείο και από αυτό το σημείο και μετά, δεν υπάρχει περαιτέρω αναφορά της στις Πράξεις των Αποστόλων ή στις επιστολές. Καμία αναφορά για το θάνατό της ή για τη θαυματουργή ανάληψή της στον ουρανό, χωρίς θάνατο. Τίποτα δεν αναφέρεται στην Αγία Γραφή.<br/>Οι αδελφοί του θα ήταν πιθανώς μια αναφορά στον Ιάκωβο και στον Ιούδα και σε εκείνους τους άλλους αδελφούς που ήταν γιοι του Ιωσήφ και της Μαρίας.<br/>Το πάνω δωμάτιο - υπάρχουν μερικοί που λένε ότι είναι το ίδιο επάνω δωμάτιο στο οποίο ο Ιησούς είχε το Μυστικό Δείπνο με τους μαθητές Του. Και όμως, υπάρχουν και άλλοι που κρατούν σε αυτό το πάνω δωμάτιο να είναι ένα δωμάτιο στους περίβολους του ναού όπου συναντιόταν η πρώιμη εκκλησία. Πάρε την επιλογή σου.<br/>Και τις ημέρες εκείνες ο Πέτρος σηκώθηκε ανάμεσα στους μαθητές, και είπε, (ο αριθμός των ονομάτων τους μαζί ήταν περίπου εκατόν είκοσι,) άνδρες και αδελφοί, αυτή η Γραφή πρέπει να έχει εκπληρωθεί, την οποία το Άγιο Πνεύμα με το στόμα του Δαβίδ μίλησε πριν σχετικά με τον Ιούδα, ο οποίος ήταν οδηγός για εκείνους που πήραν τον Ιησού (Πράξεις 1:15-16 ).<br/>Εδώ πάλι, ο Πέτρος εξακολουθεί να είναι ο ίδιος ορμητικός εαυτός του. Περιμένουν σε προσευχή και δέηση, και ο Πέτρος σηκώνεται και λέει, "Φίλοι, υπάρχει ένα εδάφιο που πρέπει να εκπληρωθεί." Και ξέρετε ότι πρόκειται να προχωρήσει μπροστά, "Ας ξεκινήσουμε το πρόγραμμα· ας ρίξουμε κλήρους και να μάθουμε ποιος θα πάρει τη θέση του Ιούδα." Αισθάνομαι ότι ο Πέτρος ήταν και πάλι στη σάρκα, εκδηλώνοντας αυτή την ορμητική φύση που ήταν δική του. Και νομίζω ότι η μελλοντική ιστορία της εκκλησίας στο βιβλίο των Πράξεων το τονίζει αυτό. Ενδιαφέρομαι για την κατανόηση του Πέτρου για τις γραφές, πώς παραθέτει από τόσα μέρη της Παλαιάς Διαθήκης. Ο Πέτρος πράγματι εκδηλώνει μια πολύ μεγάλη κατανόηση των γραφών της Παλαιάς Διαθήκης η οποία είναι ένα σημείο υπέρ του.<br/>Παρατηρήστε ότι ο Πέτρος αποδίδει στο Άγιο Πνεύμα εκείνα τα πράγματα που έγραψε ο Δαβίδ. Έτσι, «Όλη η γραφή δίνεται με έμπνευση από τον Θεό» ( 2Τι 3:16 ). Δεν είναι μέρος των γραφών. Γιατί, αν μου πεις ότι μέρος των γραφών δίνεται από την έμπνευση του Θεού, τότε πρέπει να σε ρωτήσω, "Ποια μέρη είναι από την έμπνευση και ποια μέρη δεν είναι από την έμπνευση;" Και τότε εσύ είσαι η αυθεντία που μου λέει ποιο μέρος μπορώ να πιστέψω και ποιο μέρος δεν μπορώ να πιστέψω και τη στιγμή που ο Θεός δεν είναι πια η αυθεντία αλλά εσύ είσαι η αυθεντία, είμαι σε μπελάδες. Να προσέχετε αυτούς που λένε, "Λοιπόν, δεν μπορείτε να πιστέψετε όλες τις γραφές." Οι ίδιες οι γραφές λένε, "Όλη η γραφή δίνεται από την έμπνευση του Θεού." Και εδώ, ο Λουκάς γράφοντας αυτά που έλεγε ο Πέτρος, δηλώνει ότι ο Δαβίδ ήταν στην πραγματικότητα ο εκπρόσωπος του Αγίου Πνεύματος.<br/>Διότι αριθμήθηκε μαζί μας, [ήταν ένας από τους δώδεκα] είχε αποκτήσει ένα μέρος αυτής της διακονίας. Αλλά τώρα αυτός ο άνθρωπος αγόρασε έναν αγρό με την ανταμοιβή της ανομίας· και πέφτοντας με κεφαλιά (Πράξ. 1:17-18),<br/>Αγόρασε το χωράφι, το χωράφι του αγγειοπλάστη όπως δηλώνει ο Ζαχαρίας το ενδέκατο κεφάλαιο.<br/>και πέφτοντας με το κεφάλι, έσκασε στο μέσον, και όλα τα σπλάχνα του ξεπήδησαν (Πράξ. 1:18 ).<br/>Υπάρχουν εκείνοι που βρίσκουν μια ασυμφωνία στις γραφές, γιατί σε ένα από τα ευαγγέλια μας λένε ότι όταν ο Ιούδας επέστρεψε και προσπάθησε να επιστρέψει τα χρήματα, και είπαν, "Ει, είναι δικό σου πρόβλημα, δεν μπορούμε να το πάρουμε." Και το ξαναβάλαμε στο θησαυροφυλάκιο του ναού. "Είναι ματωμένα χρήματα." Μετά τα πέταξε εκεί στο πάτωμα του ναού και βγήκε έξω και κρεμάστηκε. Εδώ ο Πέτρος μας λέει ότι έπεσε με το κεφάλι και απλά πετάχτηκε. Και υπάρχουν και εκείνοι που φαντάζονται μια ασυμφωνία. Πολύ απλό, ανέβηκε στο δέντρο για να κρεμαστεί, έδεσε το σχοινί γύρω από το λαιμό του και το έδεσε στο άκρο και πήδηξε. και η δύναμη της πτώσης είτε έσπασε το σχοινί ή το κεφάλι του, και έπεσε κάτω στο φαράγγι και ακριβώς όπως το είπε εδώ.<br/>Ήταν γνωστό σε όλους τους κατοίκους της Ιερουσαλήμ· σε τέτοιο βαθμό που ο αγρός καλείται στη γλώσσα τους, Ασελντάμα, δηλαδή, Ο αγρός του αίματος. Διότι είναι γραμμένο στο βιβλίο των Ψαλμών, Ας ερημωθεί η κατοίκησή του, και ας μην κατοικεί κανείς σ' αυτήν· και, το επισκοπικό του ας πάρει κάποιος άλλος (Πράξεις 1:19-20).<br/>Τώρα στην πραγματικότητα παραθέτει από δύο διαφορετικούς Ψαλμούς εδώ. Από το Ψα 69:25 , το τοποθετεί μαζί με το Ψα 109:8 . και βάζοντας τους δύο μαζί βρίσκει αυτές τις προφητείες σχετικά με τον Ιούδα.<br/>Για ποιο λόγο από αυτούς τους άνδρες (Πράξεις 1:21 )<br/>Τώρα εδώ είναι που ψάχνουν κάποιον να πάρει τη θέση του Ιούδα για να γίνει απόστολος.<br/>Γι' αυτό από αυτούς τους ανθρώπους που συνωμότησαν μαζί μας όλη την ώρα που ο Κύριος Ιησούς μπαινοβγαίνει ανάμεσά μας (Πράξ. 1:21 ),<br/>Τώρα θυμάστε ότι υπήρχαν πολλοί μαθητές, πολλοί μαθητές από τους οποίους ο Ιησούς επέλεξε δέκα για να είναι απόστολοι. Και η λέξη απόστολος σημαίνει "αυτός που στέλνεται". Ή επέλεξε δώδεκα για να είναι απόστολοι, έτσι έστειλε τους δώδεκα. Ο αριθμός της ανθρώπινης κυβέρνησης. "Έχουμε μόνο έντεκα. Χρειαζόμαστε έναν για να πάρουμε τη θέση του Ιούδα, αλλά χρειαζόμαστε έναν που ήταν μαζί μας όλο αυτό το διάστημα από την αρχή με τον Ιησού."<br/>Από τη στιγμή που βαπτίστηκε από τον Ιωάννη, μέχρι την ημέρα που αναλήφθηκε από εμάς, πρέπει κάποιος να χειροτονηθεί για να είναι μάρτυρας [τι;] της ανάστασής Του (Πράξεις 1:22 ).<br/>Αυτές, λοιπόν, ήταν οι απαιτήσεις που αναζητούσαν, κάποιος που ήταν γύρω από όλο αυτό το διάστημα, από την εποχή του βαπτίσματος του Ιωάννη μέχρι την ανάληψη, και κάποιος που είδε τον αναστημένο Κύριο, και έτσι θα μπορούσε να φέρει γεγονός της ανάστασης, την μαρτυρία τους για το γεγονός.<br/>Τώρα ο Παύλος ο απόστολος, αργότερα βεβαιώνοντας το γεγονός ότι ήταν απόστολος είπε, «Δεν είδα τον αναστημένο Χριστό;» Προφανώς αυτή ήταν μια από τις απαιτήσεις της αποστολικής αποστολής. Κάποιος με ρώτησε, «Υπάρχουν απόστολοι σήμερα;» Λοιπόν, δεν ξέρω. Δεν νομίζω ότι υπάρχουν με την ίδια έννοια που υπήρχαν στην Καινή Διαθήκη.Σίγουρα δεν υπάρχει κανένας σήμερα που να μπορεί να δώσει μαρτυρία για την ανάσταση όπως έκαναν.<br/>Διόρισαν δύο, ο Ιωσήφ κάλεσε τον Βαρσαβά, που επονομάστηκε Ιούστος, και τον Ματθία. Και προσευχήθηκαν, και είπαν, Εσύ, Κύριε, που γνωρίζεις τις καρδιές όλων των ανθρώπων, δείξε αν από αυτούς τους δύο που έχεις επιλέξει (Πράξ. 1:23-24),<br/>Νομίζω ότι συχνά κάνουμε αυτό το λάθος να δίνουμε στον Κύριο δύο επιλογές, και οι δύο λάθος. Περιορισμός του Θεού, βλέπετε. Είμαστε τόσο επιρρεπείς να το κάνουμε αυτό. Προφανώς, ο Παύλος ήταν επιλογή του Θεού. Ο Πίτερ ήταν ορμητικός, και πηδώντας το όπλο είπε, "Ε, πρέπει να κάνουμε κάτι, ξέρεις, πρέπει να βοηθήσουμε τον Θεό. Ξέρεις, ένας λείπει και πρέπει να τον γεμίσουμε." Και όμως, "Θεέ, ποιον από αυτούς τους δύο θέλεις;" Και δίνοντας στον Θεό τις δύο επιλογές.<br/>Δια να λάβη μέρος εις την διακονίαν ταύτην και την αποστολικήν αυτήν, από της οποίας έπεσε ο Ιούδας δια της παραβάσεως, δια να υπάγη εις τον τόπον αυτού.<br/>Ένας ενδιαφέρων τρόπος με τον οποίο επιδίωκαν να καθορίσουν το θέλημα του Θεού. Ας ρίξουμε ζάρια, να μάθουμε ποιο είναι το θέλημα του Θεού εδώ. Είναι ενδιαφέρον για μένα, οι διάφοροι τρόποι που οι άνθρωποι επινόησαν για να διακρίνουν το θέλημα του Θεού. Τώρα, στους χρόνους της Παλαιάς Διαθήκης είχαν έναν ενδιαφέροντα τρόπο να έρχονται στον ιερέα, ο οποίος θα τους ρωτούσε τον Κύριο μέσω των Ουρίμ και των Θουμμίμ, τα "φως και τις τελειότητες." Ακριβώς τι ήταν αυτά τα Ουρίμ και Θουμμίμ, δεν γνωρίζουμε. Είμαι σίγουρος ότι δεν ήταν τα χρωματιστά γυαλιά που βρήκε ο Τζόζεφ Σμιθ με τις Χρυσές Ταμπλέτες. Τα μαγικά γυαλιά, που όταν τα φορέσεις, θα μπορούσες ξαφνικά να διαβάσεις την ιερογλυφική γραφή.<br/>Υπάρχουν εκείνοι που λένε ότι οι Ουρίμ και Θουμμίμ ήταν στην πραγματικότητα μια μαύρη και μια λευκή πέτρα που φοριόταν σε ένα σακουλάκι στο στήθος του ιερέα. Θυμάστε ότι ο Δαβίδ έκανε στον Κύριο συγκεκριμένες ερωτήσεις: "Κύριε, θα βγούμε εναντίον των Φιλισταίων;" Η απάντηση ήταν, "Όχι." Έτσι και πάλι, την επόμενη μέρα, "Κύριε, θα βγούμε εναντίον των Φιλισταίων;" Η απάντηση ήταν, "Ναι." "Πότε θα πάμε;" Έθεταν συγκεκριμένες ερωτήσεις, και ο Κύριος τις κατηύθυνε μέσω του Ουρίμ και του Θουμμίνου. Λένε ότι ο ιερέας θα προσευχόταν, θα ζητούσε τον Θεό, και μετά θα έμπαινε μέσα και θα έβγαζε μια από τις δύο πέτρες. Αν ήταν η λευκή πέτρα, ήταν μια απάντηση ναι. Αν ήταν ένα όχι, τότε θα ήταν η μαύρη πέτρα που θα τραβούσε έξω. Μερικοί μάλιστα λένε ότι παίρνουμε τον όρο blackballed από αυτό το Urim και το Thummmim. Στην πραγματικότητα, πίσω στο πρωτότυπο είναι μια αρνητική ψήφος ενάντια σε ένα συγκεκριμένο έργο ή ιδέα. Τι ακριβώς ήταν οι Ουρίμ και οι Θουμμίμ, δεν ξέρουμε, αλλά κατά την περίοδο της Παλαιάς Διαθήκης, χρησιμοποίησαν μια μέθοδο χύτευσης κλήρου για να καθορίσουν το θέλημα του Θεού.<br/>Έτσι εδώ οι μαθητές μαζεύουν το ίδιο πράγμα καθώς ρίχνουν τα ζάρια για να δουν ποιος από τους δύο συντρόφους που είχε επιλέξει ο Θεός για να αντικαταστήσει τον Ιούδα τον Ισκαριώτη.<br/>Ο κλήρος έπεσε πάνω στον Ματθία· ήταν αριθμημένος με τους ένδεκα (Πράξ. 1:26 ).<br/>Τώρα ποιος στον κόσμο είναι ο Ματθίας; Κανείς δεν τον έχει ακούσει ποτέ πριν ή από τότε. Θα είναι ενδιαφέρον να συναντήσουμε τον Ματθία και να μάθουμε ποιος είναι και τι έκανε. Νομίζω από την επόμενη ιστορία, είναι προφανές να υποθέσουμε ότι ο Θεός επέλεξε τον Παύλο ως απόστολο. Τώρα αυτή είναι η τελευταία φορά που διαβάζουμε γι' αυτούς που επιζητούν να διακρίνουν το θέλημα του Θεού με το να ρίχνουν κλήρους ή κατά τύχη κάτι τέτοιο.<br/>Γνωρίζω έναν άνθρωπο σήμερα, επιδιώκοντας να διακρίνει το θέλημα του Κυρίου, θα προσευχηθεί και θα κάνει στον Κύριο μια ερώτηση. Θα έχει δέκα δεκάρες στην τσέπη του, και καθώς προσεύχεται, θα πάρει τα δεκάρα με τα μάτια κλειστά και θα τα βάλει κάτω στο τραπέζι, και αν ανέβουν όλα κεφάλια, είναι ναι. Ένα ενδιαφέρον πράγμα, που και που, όλοι θα ανεβαίνουν κεφάλια, και αυτό είναι αρκετά καλές πιθανότητες. Ωστόσο, δεν βρίσκουμε κανένα μοτίβο για αυτό μετά την παροχή του Αγίου Πνεύματος. Μόλις το Άγιο Πνεύμα ήρθε πάνω στην εκκλησία, τότε το Άγιο Πνεύμα άρχισε να τους μιλάει και να τους κατευθύνει. Και το Άγιο Πνεύμα είπε, «Διαχωρίστε μου τον Παύλο και τον Βαρνάβα για τη διακονία όπου τους έχω καλέσει» (Πράξ. 13:2). Και το Άγιο Πνεύμα τους έστειλε. Έτσι βρίσκουμε την εκκλησία πιο άμεσα καθοδηγούμενη από το Άγιο Πνεύμα. Μόλις ήρθε το Άγιο Πνεύμα, αυτή η ρίψη ζαριών για να ανακαλύψει το θέλημα του Θεού παραμερίστηκε.<br/>"<br/><br/>Μετάφραση Βασιλέως Ιακώβου<br/><br/>Αυτή είναι η Μετάφραση Βασιλέως Ιακώβου του 1769 της Αγίας Γραφής (γνωστή και ως Εξουσιοδοτημένη Μετάφραση).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2. Most noise cancelling headphones use the built in mic for the DSP (the noise cancelling) and to make calls so the signal from the mic needs to be able to be sent to the phone too.<br/>3.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Ναι αυτό είναι σωστό, οι Urbanears δεν έχουν ενσωματωμένο στο θόρυβο ακυρώνοντας το μικρόφωνο στο ίδιο το ακουστικό αλλά από ό, τι μπορώ να δω υπάρχει ένα μικρόφωνο στο καλώδιο που παρέχεται.<br/>1. Το μικρόφωνο τοποθετείται συνήθως όπου μπορεί να έχει σύνδεση με το PCB τα οποία βρίσκονται μέσα στα ακουστικά οπότε αν εννοείτε ότι το μικρόφωνο δεν πρέπει να βρίσκεται στο ίδιο το ακουστικό, αυτό (από την εμπειρία μου) είναι εσφαλμένο.<br/>2. Τα περισσότερα ακουστικά ακύρωσης θορύβου χρησιμοποιούν το ενσωματωμένο μικρόφωνο για το DSP (την ακύρωση θορύβου) και για να κάνουν κλήσεις έτσι το σήμα από το μικρόφωνο πρέπει να είναι σε θέση να σταλεί και στο τηλέφωνο.<br/>3.

Στην πραγματικότητα, οι δυναμικοί οδηγοί λειτουργούν ακριβώς το ίδιο με τα δυναμικά μικρόφωνα αλλά αντίστροφα. Μέσα σε ένα δυναμικό οδηγό υπάρχει ένας μαγνήτης, και όταν συνδέετε τα ακουστικά, στέλνετε ένα ρεύμα εναλλασσόμενου ρεύματος μέσα από αυτό το οποίο θα μετατρέψει το πηνίο φωνής σε μαγνήτη. Ανάλογα με την κατεύθυνση του ρεύματος, η πολικότητα του μαγνήτη θα αλλάξει. Τώρα που γνωρίζουμε για μαγνήτη, τα ίδια φορτία απωθούνται και διαφορετικά φορτία έλκονται, γνωρίζουμε ότι το πηνίο φωνής θα κινείται μπρος-πίσω ανάλογα με την πολικότητα του εκείνη την εποχή. Το πηνίο φωνής είναι προσκολλημένο στο διάφραγμα το οποίο στη συνέχεια θα κινείται μπρος-πίσω δημιουργώντας ένα ηχητικό κύμα. Το ίδιο συμβαίνει και αντίστροφα, αν μετακινήσετε ένα πηνίο μέσα από ένα μαγνήτη παράγετε αντ' αυτού ένα ρεύμα. Δεδομένου ότι η φωνή σας πιέζει το διάφραγμα, μετακινεί το πηνίο φωνής εμπρός και πίσω δημιουργώντας το ρεύμα που έχετε παρατηρήσει.<br/><br/>100+ Κεφαλίδα-Fier<br/><br/>Συνδέθηκε:<br/>7 Νοε 2011<br/><br/>Δημοσιεύσεις:<br/>134 ετών<br/><br/>Αρέσει: 55<br/><br/>Ακριβώς.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Μετά το θάνατο του Λένιν το 1924, το αρχικό κόμμα ...δείτε στη μέση του εγγράφου...<br/><br/>Έλεγχε όλες τις πτυχές της ζωής των ανθρώπων· τον Πολιτισμό· τις σταδιοδρομίες και τις θέσεις εργασίας, ακόμη και εκεί που ζούσαν (κολλεκτίβωση).<br/>Η σωματική βλάβη που προκλήθηκε στο Κόμμα ως αποτέλεσμα των δοκιμαστικών επιδείξεων έβλαψε επίσης την πολιτική επιβολή των ιδεωδών των Μπολσεβίκων στη ρωσική πολιτική. Η αντιπολίτευση του Στάλιν στο εσωτερικό του κόμματος, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των Μπουχάριν, Γιαγκόντα και Ρίκοφ εκκαθαρίστηκαν σε αυτές τις δίκες επίδειξης, καθώς ο Στάλιν τους ανάγκασε με χειραγώγηση να ομολογήσουν εγκλήματα σχεδιασμού πραξικοπήματος και εναντίωσης στο κράτος, ακόμη και αν δεν υπήρχε απόδειξη. Ο Gabor T Rittersporn είπε, «Πολλά από τα θύματα ήταν ειλικρινά αφοσιωμένα στις αρχές του Μπολσεβικισμού». Αυτό ενισχύει την απόδειξη ότι τα μπολσεβικικά ιδεώδη που κάποτε ήταν οι ρίζες του Κομμουνιστικού Κόμματος είχαν αποδιοργανωθεί και καταστραφεί από τους Purges. Το κόμμα εξαντλήθηκε και πρώην μέλη παρακολουθούσαν ανήμποροι τον Στάλιν να χρησιμοποιεί τη μεγάλη εκκαθάριση ως εργαλείο για να μετατρέψει τη Ρωσία από ένα κομματικό κράτος σε μια αδιαμφισβήτητη δικτατορία. Και πάλι, οι εκκαθαρίσεις συνέτριβαν το πλαίσιο του Κομμουνιστικού Κόμματος, που σχηματίστηκε κατά τη διάρκεια της επανάστασης των Μπολσεβίκων. Αυτό συμφωνεί με την πηγή "Στάλιν ο εκτελεστής" καθώς και οι δύο δείχνουν τον χειριστικό χαρακτήρα, που βοήθησε τον δικτάτορα να ενισχύσει τη λαβή του στο λαιμό της Ρωσίας.<br/>Ο χειραγωγικός τρόπος, με τον οποίο ο Στάλιν ενοχοποιούσε τη στοχευμένη αντίθεσή του κατά τη διάρκεια των εκκαθαρίσεων, στα μάτια των καθημερινών Ρώσων, είχε επίσης μια καταρρέουσα επίδραση στη Σοβιετική Κοινωνία. Ο Στάλιν ήταν σε θέση να συλλέξει υποστήριξη από το λαό μέσω της χρήσης προπαγάνδας του και των μέσων ενημέρωσης για να τον βοηθήσει να αναπτύξει μια "λατρεία προσωπικότητας" και την εικόνα ενός ηρωικού και γενναίου ηγέτη. Μέσω αυτής της υποστήριξης ο Στάλιν εμφύτευσε δυσπιστία στο μυαλό του λαού, πείθοντάς τους ότι οι προδότες της επανάστασης και αυτό που περιέγραψε ως «εχθρούς του λαού», ήταν μεταξύ αυτών.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Το Supercell είναι nerfing brawlers αντί για nerfing star powers. Ήμουν στα 750 την περασμένη σεζόν με το power 8 nita και είναι πολύ δύσκολο να περάσεις ότι, όπως, οι star powers παίζουν έναν πραγματικά κυρίαρχο ρόλο. Όταν παίζω gem grab(γύρω στα 600 τρόπαια), υπάρχουν συχνά ματς όπου η αντίπαλη ομάδα έχει έναν ακόμη παίκτη από εμάς που είναι maxed και δεν είναι καν ότι έχουμε ένα lvl 9 για να ανταγωνιστούμε εναντίον αυτού. Μερικές φορές υπάρχουν ακόμη και ματς όπου η αντίπαλη ομάδα είναι πλήρως μεγιστοποιημένη και κανένας από εμάς δεν είναι. γι' αυτό δεν παίζω πια σταρ του καυγά σοβαρά. Δεν είναι καν σαν να υπάρχουν πολλοί παίκτες που δεν είναι μεγιστοποιημένοι και γύρω στα 600 τρόπαια. Είναι ενοχλητικό.<br/>Επεξεργασία: Νομίζω ότι το υπερκύτταρο θα πρέπει να έχει τουλάχιστον ένα βασικό μηχανισμό που παίρνει το μέσο όρο των επιπέδων των μαχητικών κατά τη δημιουργία αγώνων.<br/><br/>Μόνο που τα τρόπαια δεν δείχνουν την επιδεξιότητά σου, υποδεικνύουν την επιδεξιότητα των συμπαικτών με τους οποίους είσαι τοποθετημένος και είμαι εντάξει με το να παίζω απέναντι σε υψηλόβαθμους καυχησιολόγους, αλλά όταν η μία ομάδα είναι όλα επιπέδου 10 και η άλλη ομάδα δεν είναι, προφανώς είναι ανισόρροπη.<br/><br/>Συνιστώ να έχω μερικούς καλούς φίλους για να παίξω, εγώ και 2 φίλοι πήρα τους φίλους μου δύναμη 1 τσιμπούρι για να καταταγούν 28 παίζοντας gem grab με μια συγκεκριμένη σύνθεση όλη την ημέρα και τα καταφέραμε χωρίς ούτε ένα από εμάς να είναι μεγιστοποιημένοι με τους φιλονικίες μας.<br/><br/>Ξέρω πως νιώθεις που είχα καυγάδες σε μεγάλα τρόπαια με χαμηλό επίπεδο και είναι δύσκολο να προχωρήσεις περισσότερο και όλα όσα έλεγα στον εαυτό μου "θέλω να έχω δυνάμεις αστέρων" πραγματικά υπερκύτταρα πρέπει να κάνουν ισορροπία στις δυνάμεις των άστρων ή τουλάχιστον να κάνουν ένα καλύτερο σύστημα προξενιών.<br/><br/>Νιώθω κάπως έτσι. Δεν είμαι τόσο καλός στο παιχνίδι όσο εσύ, αλλά πήρα τον Εμς στο 500 στην εξουσία 1 και τα προξενιά ήταν φρικτά. Μεγιστοποίησαν τους παίκτες παντού! Και δεν βοήθησε που η πλειοψηφία των συμπαικτών μου είχε γύρω στα 5-8k τρόπαια... Έπρεπε να καταφύγω σε σόλο αναμέτρηση την τελευταία στιγμή επειδή μπορώ είτε να στήσω ενέδρα σε ανυποψίαστους παίκτες είτε απλά να παίξω λίγο επιθετικά την κατάλληλη στιγμή. Αλλά πραγματικά εύχομαι ότι θα μπορούσε να είναι λίγο πιο εύκολο για τους ανθρώπους που θέλουν να σπρώξουν τους καυγατζήδες σε πραγματικά υψηλά τρόπαια χωρίς να έχουν την πολυτέλεια των δυνάμεων των άστρων.<br/><br/>Η ακίδα Altho εξακολουθεί να είναι καλή χωρίς καμπυλωτή μπάλα. Η καμπυλωτή μπάλα ήταν απλά μια βοήθεια για να χτυπάτε τις βολές σας πιο συχνά ως ακίδα. Αλλά ακόμα και πριν κυκλοφορήσει η καμπυλωτή μπάλα, η ακίδα ήταν μια πραγματικά ισχυρή αψιμαχία, οπότε θα παραμείνει ο ίδιος τώρα.<br/><br/>Συμφωνώ ότι θα έπρεπε να είχαν στήσει ενέδρα, αλλά νομίζω ότι προσπαθούν να ισορροπήσουν τόσο το Σνάπι Σνάιπινγκ όσο και το Άμπους, καθώς και οι δύο συγχωνεύονται με αυτή την αλλαγή.<br/><br/>Δεν είμαι σίγουρος γι' αυτό, αλλά τώρα που ο Ντάρυλ πήρε μια αισθητή ώθηση, κοιτάζοντας τα νέα στατιστικά τους, φαίνεται ότι ο Ντάρυλ μπορεί να επισκιάσει τον Μπουλ, καθώς όχι μόνο μπορεί πάντα να αντιμετωπίσει περισσότερες ζημιές από τον Μπουλ, δεν θα πεθάνει τόσο νωρίς πια, οπότε η επιβιωσιμότητα τους θα είναι παρόμοια χωρίς την ισχύ των άστρων (αν και η επιβίωση του Μπουλ εξακολουθεί να είναι αισθητά καλύτερη από του Ντάρυλ αν είχε τον Σκληρό Γκάι). Όχι μόνο αυτό, ο σούπερ του Ντάρυλ μπορεί να αναγεννηθεί αυτόματα, που σημαίνει ότι ο Ντάρυλ ΜΑΖΙ μπορεί να παιχτεί αποτελεσματικά τόσο ως βαρέων βαρών όσο και ως δολοφόνος ταυτόχρονα (πριν ρουφήξει ως βαρέων βαρών αλλά αξιοπρεπής ως δολοφόνος)<br/><br/>Αλλά έχει υπερεκτιμήσει τον af. Και παίρνεις τρόπαια μαζί του πολύ εύκολα. Έτσι είμαι κάπως εντάξει με τον nerf. Δεν τον έχω παίξει καν από τότε που τον πήρα στα 500 (γύρω στους 5 μήνες πριν), έτσι δεν με νοιάζει και τόσο πολύ.<br/><br/>Γιατί οι Poco/Penny δεν παίρνουν ένα HP nerf, αν είναι Marksman/Healer αντίστοιχα όχι ένα τανκ;<br/>Γιατί δεν τρέμει η νεροποντή της Ρόζα, με μείωση των ζημιών κατά 70%;<br/>Γιατί επιτρέπεται στον Τικ να έχει το υψηλότερο βεληνεκές και την πιο ελεύθερη λακκούβα σε ολόκληρο το παιχνίδι;<br/>Γιατί ο Λίον δεν παίρνει ένα HP/Damage buff;<br/><br/>Όπως και να έχει, ήταν το Ambush που ήταν OP, όχι η βάση Piper. Θα υποστήριζα ότι το Ambush είναι η καλύτερη δύναμη στα αστέρια στο παιχνίδι (τώρα ακόμα περισσότερο αφού το ποσοστό της αύξησης των ζημιών ανέβηκε έμμεσα) και το base Piper ήταν ένα bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Αυτό που πρέπει να κάνει το Supercell είναι να επαναφέρει και τα δύο νέφους, να μειώσει το Ambush στα 600, και να μειώσει το Snappy Sniping στα 0,25 αφού θα ήταν έμμεσα buffed από την buff ζημιά βάσης.<br/><br/>Ναι και πιστεύω ότι το παρατράβηξαν με τη Ρόζα, γιατί τώρα είναι βασικά ο καλύτερος ταύρος τώρα, όταν πρόκειται για τανκ, το οποίο ήταν για λίγο.<br/><br/>Γιατί; Αισθάνομαι ότι χρειάζεται ένα buff σε σχεδόν τα πάντα εκτός από τη δύναμη του άστρου της. Η υγεία και η ταχύτητά της την κάνουν σούπερ λίγο πιο δύσκολη στη χρήση, επειδή μπορεί να πεθάνει αρκετά εύκολα, και είναι πραγματικά δύσκολο για αυτήν να παγιδεύσει ταχύτερους καυγατζήδες όπως ο Κρόου. Η δύναμη του άστρου της είναι λίγο σπασμένη αν και... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Αυτοαπασχόληση Μέρος 1ο<br/><br/>Όταν δέχεστε μια εργασία σε οποιονδήποτε οργανισμό, πρέπει να εκτελείτε διάφορες εργασίες σύμφωνα με τις απαιτήσεις του εργοδότη σας και μπορεί να λάβετε ένα σταθερό ποσό εισοδήματος ως μισθό.

Τα πρόσωπα αυτά επιδίδονται σε μια οικονομική δραστηριότητα που χαρακτηρίζεται ως μισθωτή απασχόληση ή αμειβόμενη απασχόληση.Αλλά υπάρχουν πολλά άτομα που επιδίδονται σε μια απασχόληση ή κάποια επιχείρηση την οποία ξεκινούν και διαχειρίζονται μόνα τους.

Όλοι μας έχουμε δει μικρά παντοπωλεία, καταστήματα ραπτικής, ιατρικά καταστήματα κ.λπ. στην περιοχή μας. Αυτά ανήκουν και διαχειρίζονται από ένα άτομο, με ή χωρίς τη βοήθεια κάποιων βοηθών. Οι οικονομικές τους δραστηριότητες χαρακτηρίζονται ως αυτοαπασχόληση.
