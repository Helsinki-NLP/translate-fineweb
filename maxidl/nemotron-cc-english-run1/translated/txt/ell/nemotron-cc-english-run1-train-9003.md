| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses. What an exciting hub. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko from Texas on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Following Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"The pure white of the lily's skin<br/><br/>Speaks of no beauty from within<br/><br/>Just Monet's way or goal<br/><br/>For feasting eyes<br/><br/>Not feasting for the soul"<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for returning Kim, I'm so pleased with the responses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense.

Κύριος στόχος αυτού του τύπου ποίησης είναι η δημιουργία ποιημάτων μέσω της συνεργασίας διαφόρων συγγραφέων/ποιητών, προσπαθώντας να σχηματίσουν μια ενοποιημένη φωνή ενώ διατηρούν ακόμα τις επιμέρους φωνές τους.<br/><br/>Αν και οι ακριβείς αφηγήσεις και τα αρχεία πολλών τέτοιων γεγονότων είτε χάνονται είτε λείπουν.<br/><br/>Ένα από τα πιο γνωστά παραδείγματα συλλογικής ποίησης ήταν η συλλογή ποιημάτων με τίτλο Ralentir Travaux από τους Σουρεαλιστές Γάλλους ποιητές André Breton, Paul éluard και René Char. Αυτοί οι τρεις ποιητές συνεργάστηκαν για να γράψουν τα ποιήματα σε αυτή τη συλλογή για μόλις πέντε ημέρες το 1930.<br/><br/>Κατά τη διάρκεια της δεκαετίας του 1940, ο Τσαρλς Ανρί Φορντ, ένας Αμερικανός ποιητής, επινόησε αυτό που αποκαλούσε "ποίημα της αλυσίδας", όπου κάθε ποιητής έγραφε μια γραμμή και στη συνέχεια έστελνε το ποίημα σε ένα άλλο πρόσωπο (για να συνεχίσει) σε ένα άλλο μέρος του κόσμου, ταχυδρομικά.<br/><br/>Το 2007 μια συλλογή αμερικανικής συνεργατικής ποίησης Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry επιμελήθηκε και εκδόθηκε από τις Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton και David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Η συνεργατική ποίηση έχει χρησιμοποιηθεί σε σχολεία και κολέγια για να διδάξει στους μαθητές την ομαδική εργασία και να ανακαλύψει τρόπους με τους οποίους συνδέονται.(πηγή: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Η μελέτη μιας φιγούρας σε εξωτερικούς χώρους: Γυναίκα με ένα Παράσολ, με το βλέμμα στραμμένο αριστερά, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Δημόσιος τομέας ή Δημόσιος τομέας], μέσω Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Ο Σκοπός αυτού του Άρθρου και Πώς να Πλησιάσουμε την Πρόκληση<br/><br/>Λίγα χρόνια πριν έγραψα ένα άρθρο με τίτλο "Ποίημα Χωρίς Τέλος" το οποίο περιελάμβανε ένα χριστουγεννιάτικο ποίημα που είχα γράψει και στο οποίο δάνειζα τον εαυτό μου για να προστεθεί. Έμεινα κατάπληκτος από την ανταπόκριση καθώς σε εκείνο το στάδιο είχα μόνο λίγους οπαδούς εδώ. Οι άνθρωποι έγραψαν μια στροφή της ποίησης ο καθένας σε "σχόλια" στον κόμβο για να ακολουθήσουν από τον προηγούμενο σχολιαστή. Εργάστηκε πολύ καλά και στο τέλος συνέταξα όλες τις συνεισφορές σε ένα μόνο ποίημα ως μέρος του κόμβου.<br/><br/>Παρόμοιες προκλήσεις έχουν εκδοθεί από τότε, συμπεριλαμβανομένης μιας από τον Frank Atanacio που ονομάζεται "Spirits Sat as Mourners" που ήταν επίσης πολύ επιτυχημένη. Η διαφορά είναι ότι σε εκείνη την περίπτωση οι συνεισφέροντες έγραψαν τους δικούς τους κόμβους για τη σταντ τους στην ποίηση και έθεσαν ένα σύνδεσμο στον αρχικό κόμβο του Φρανκ.<br/><br/>Για τη συγκεκριμένη πρόκληση δεν περιμένω από όλους να ξοδέψουν πολύτιμο χρόνο γράφοντας ξεχωριστούς κόμβους για μια στροφή ποίησης (εκτός αν πραγματικά το θέλεις). Το κύριο πρόβλημα είναι ότι για να γίνει αποτελεσματικό θα πρέπει να αντιγράψετε τα προηγουμένως γραμμένα μέρη του ποιήματος στον κόμβο σας και πιθανότατα θα χτυπηθεί με ετικέτα "διπλασιασμός".<br/><br/>Έτσι, ότι είναι η περίπτωση, και επίσης για να σώσει πρέπει να αφήσει συνδέσεις παντού, απλά ζητώ ότι όποιος θέλει να λάβει μέρος απλά να γράψει το stanza τους εδώ σε "σχόλια." Ελέγξτε το τελευταίο σχόλιο πριν από το δικό σας που συμβάλλει στην πρόκληση και να ακολουθήσει. Αν δω περισσότερους από έναν ακολούθους από την ίδια στροφή θα χρησιμοποιήσω την ποιητική μου άδεια για να τους εργαστώ όπως κρίνω καλύτερα.<br/><br/>Σε κάποιο στάδιο, όταν αισθάνομαι ότι έχουν προστεθεί αρκετές στροφές, πιθανότατα θα επικαλεστώ ένα τέλος στην πρόκληση και στη συνέχεια θα τις συγκεντρώσω όλες μαζί ως το ολοκληρωμένο ποίημα ως μέρος του άρθρου (δίνοντας επίσης εύσημα σε κάθε συνεισφέροντα).<br/><br/>Ανθισμένο Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Κλωντ Μονέ [Δημόσιος τομέας], μέσω Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Η Πρόκληση!<br/><br/>Τώρα έρχεται το ενδιαφέρον κομμάτι. Αν ενταχθείς σε αυτή την αλυσιδωτή πρόκληση ποίησης θα πρέπει να προσπαθήσεις να κρατήσεις το ύφος και τη φωνή του ποιήματος όσο το δυνατόν πιο κοντά στους προηγούμενους στίχους, έτσι ώστε σε ανενημέρωτους αναγνώστες θα φανεί ότι μόνο ένας συγγραφέας έχει γράψει ολόκληρο το ποίημα.<br/><br/>Ακούγεται εύκολο, λέτε; Καλά ίσως θα ήταν αν το ποίημα είχε ένα παραδοσιακό στυλ, ομοιοκαταληξία ή μετρητή. Αλλά αυτό δεν το κάνει! Το ποίημα που θα προσθέσεις ξεκίνησε από μια γνωριμία μου Andriealphus ως "chain poem chain chain poem challenge" αλλού. Την εποχή της συγγραφής ήμουν το μόνο άλλο άτομο που είχε δεχτεί την πρόκληση, και επειδή αγαπούσα το θέμα σκέφτηκα ότι θα ήταν μεγάλη πρόκληση για τους συναδέλφους μου συγγραφείς και αποφάσισα να το χρησιμοποιήσω εδώ και να δω αν η απάντηση θα ήταν καλύτερη. (Ξέρω μερικούς ποιητές εδώ των οποίων η γραφή θα ταίριαζε σε αυτό το ύφος)<br/><br/>Κανόνες :<br/><br/>Συνέχεια από την προηγούμενη στροφή σε σχόλια<br/><br/>Προσπάθησε να διατηρήσεις τη φωνή και το ύφος του ποιήματος<br/><br/>Διατηρήστε τη στροφή/στροφή σας περίπου στο ίδιο μήκος με αυτά που προηγήθηκαν<br/><br/>Ο Κλοντ Μονέ ήταν ένας από τους πιο διάσημους ζωγράφους στην ιστορία της τέχνης και ηγετική φυσιογνωμία στο ιμπρεσιονιστικό κίνημα.<br/><br/>Το 1883 ο Μονέ μετακόμισε στο Giverny.Εδώ, του άρεσε να ζωγραφίζει σε εξωτερικούς χώρους στους κήπους που βοήθησε να δημιουργηθεί. Τα κρίνα νερού που βρέθηκαν στη λίμνη είχαν μια ιδιαίτερη απήχηση, και ζωγράφισε αρκετές σειρές από αυτά καθ' όλη τη διάρκεια της υπόλοιπης ζωής του· η γέφυρα ιαπωνικού τύπου πάνω από τη λίμνη έγινε αντικείμενο αρκετών έργων, επίσης.<br/><br/>Το 1912 ο Μονέ ζωγράφισε μια σειρά από 12 υδατογραφημένους πίνακες που ανατέθηκαν από το Orangerie des Tuileries, ένα μουσείο στο Παρίσι. Επέλεξε να τους κάνει σε πολύ μεγάλη κλίμακα, και να χρησιμεύσει ως "αχυρό ειρηνικού διαλογισμού". Αυτό το έργο κατανάλωσε μεγάλο μέρος των μετέπειτα χρόνων του Μονέ. Ο Μονέ δήλωσε κάποτε, "Αυτά τα τοπία του νερού και της αντανάκλασης έχουν γίνει εμμονή για μένα. Είναι πέρα από τη δύναμή μου ως γέρος, και όμως θέλω να αποδώσω αυτό που αισθάνομαι."<br/><br/>Σχεδόν τυφλός, με τα δύο μάτια του να επηρεάζονται σοβαρά από καταρράκτη, ο Μονέ τελικά συμφώνησε να υποβληθεί σε χειρουργική επέμβαση για την ασθένεια το 1923.<br/><br/>Τα διάσημα νούφαρα του Μονέ έγιναν πιο κόκκινα καθώς ο καταρράκτης του προχωρούσε. Μετά από διορθωτική επέμβαση κατέστρεψε τους περισσότερους από τους "κόκκινους κρίνους" πίνακες, θυμωμένος που κανείς δεν του το ανέφερε πραγματικά. Κατά ειρωνικό τρόπο, αυτοί οι πίνακες ήταν πιθανώς αυτό που έκανε το ιμπρεσιονιστικό ύφος του τόσο διάσημο εκείνη την εποχή -- οι καλλιτέχνες άρχισαν να παίρνουν περισσότερα ρίσκα με το χρώμα και τέτοια κατά τη διάρκεια αυτού του σημείου.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Πρώτα απ 'όλα η ίδια η EEQT πρέπει να αναπτυχθεί περαιτέρω, προκειμένου να παρέχει μια θεωρητική και υπολογιστική απάντηση στις ανάγκες της σύγχρονης κβαντικής μηχανικής και τεχνολογίας. Πρέπει να συμπεριλάβουμε κλασικά συστήματα με άπειρους αριθμούς βαθμών ελευθερίας - όπως το ηλεκτρομαγνητικό ή/και το βαρυτικό πεδίο. Πρέπει επίσης να συμπεριλάβουμε άπειρα κβαντικά συστήματα έτσι ώστε να κατανοήσουμε και να προσομοιώσουμε το αέριο Bose και τις μεταβάσεις φάσης του. Αλλά, υπάρχουν επίσης βήματα που πρέπει να γίνουν πολύ πέρα από το παράδειγμα της EEQT.<br/>Όπως έχουμε τονίσει τόσες πολλές φορές: η κβαντική θεωρία δεν έχει ακόμη κατανοηθεί με όρους μιας "μη γραμμικής κλασικής θεωρίας". Αλλά αυτό που εννοούμε με μια "κλασική θεωρία" είναι κάτι πολύ πιο προηγμένο και γενικότερο από την κλασική μηχανική ή την κλασική θεωρία πεδίου. Με τον όρο "κλασική θεωρία" εννοούμε πρώτα απ' όλα, μια θεωρία που δεν βασίζεται στις πιθανότητες από την αρχή· μια θεωρία στην οποία οι πιθανότητες εμφανίζονται σε μεταγενέστερο στάδιο, που προέρχεται από τη θεωρία· που προέρχεται ίσως, με αναγκαίο τρόπο. Μια τέτοια θεωρία πρέπει όχι μόνο να προσδιορίζει τα μαθηματικά αντικείμενα και τις σχέσεις τους αλλά και να κάνει "προλήψεις".<br/>Μια κλασική θεωρία είναι, συγκεκριμένα, μια θεωρία στην οποία μπορούν να συμβούν διακριτά γεγονότα, γεγονότα που είναι "αντικειμενικά". Μπορεί να είναι γεγονότα που επηρεάζουν κυρίως το φυσικό στρώμα, αλλά μπορεί να είναι και «ψυχικά γεγονότα», αλλαγές καταστάσεων «συνείδησης»· ό,τι κι αν είναι, ακόμη κι αν ασχολούνται με διακλαδώσεις συμπάντων, - συμβαίνουν.<br/>Μια τέτοια θεωρία, που περιλαμβάνει την κβαντική θεωρία όπως την γνωρίζουμε σήμερα, δεν υπάρχει ακόμα, αλλά μπορούμε να οραματιστούμε το πιθανό σχήμα της. Τίποτα δεν εξυπηρετεί καλύτερα από ένα παράδειγμα, οπότε ας δώσουμε εδώ ένα παράδειγμα για το πώς μια τέτοια θεωρία μπορεί να ερμηνευθεί.<br/>Φανταστείτε μια θεωρία ανέπτυξε την ενοποιημένη θεωρία πεδίου του a'la Einstein, αλλά με μεταβλητή μετρική υπογραφή, πιθανώς με ένα σύνθετο αιτιώδη ιστό, πολλαπλάσια<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (βλ. επίσης [41]) γέφυρες, χρονικές θηλιές, μη-διαφορετικότητα, φράκταλ δομή, όλα αυτά επιπλέον περιπλέκονται από μεταβλητή διαστατικότητα του χώρου και του "χρόνου" (cf [42]. Φανταστείτε μια τέτοια θεωρία να είναι σε θέση να συμπυκνώσει όλες τις τέσσερις θεμελιώδεις δυνάμεις που μας είναι γνωστές, αλλά περιλαμβάνει επίσης ένα επιπλέον πεδίο, το οποίο είναι διαφορετικό από τα φυσικά πεδία, και το οποίο είναι μη τοπικό με την έννοια ότι δεν επιβιώνει λαμβάνοντας ένα μακρο-μέσο όριο όταν ανακτηθεί η αιτιώδης χωροχρονική δομή της γενικής σχετικότητας του Αϊνστάιν. Αυτό το επιπλέον πεδίο θα ήταν ένα μέρος για "μορφές σκέψης" και η θεωρία μας θα ένωνε αυτές τις μορφές σκέψης σε πιο "φυσικά" επίπεδα της πραγματικότητας.<br/>Τίποτα δεν εμποδίζει μια θεωρία τέτοιου τύπου να έχει μαθηματικές δομές αρκετά πλούσιες ώστε να συμπυκνώνουν τη συνείδηση και το μυαλό. Λόγω της πολυπλοκότητάς του, της πυκνότητας του χρόνου-λουπς, της φυσαλίδας-όπως αιτιώδους δομής, κάνοντας προβλέψεις σε τέτοια θεωρία είναι δυνατή μόνο με την εφαρμογή πιθανότητας -<br/>όπως συμβαίνει με τα συστήματα που εξελίσσονται σύμφωνα με την ντετερμινιστική αλλά χαοτική δυναμική. Η κβαντική κυματική λειτουργία θα αναδυόταν σε μια τέτοια θεωρία ως ένας αποτελεσματικός τρόπος πρόβλεψης. Αυτός ο τύπος εξήγησης του κβαντικού απροσδιόριστου είχε διατυπωθεί εδώ και πολύ καιρό από τον I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] εικάζει ότι ο κβαντικός απροσδιόριστος μπορεί να γίνει κατανοητός αν παραδεχτούμε ότι μεμονωμένα κβαντικά γεγονότα που πραγματικά συμβαίνουν εδώ και τώρα έχουν μελλοντικά προχωρημένα αίτια έχουν επίσης παρελθόν καθυστερημένα αίτια.<br/>Μια ματιά σε μια τέτοια σκέψη μπορεί να συνέβη στον Άλαν Τούρινγκ όταν έγραψε τη διάσημη, ήδη παρατιθέμενη πρόταση του: "Η προκατάληψη πρέπει να είναι γραμμική, η περιγραφή πρέπει να είναι μη γραμμική".<br/>Μια θεωρία που πηγαίνει εν μέρει προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση αναπτύσσεται από τον L. Nottale<br/>[43] που δηλώνει την παρατήρηση, που αποδίδεται στον Feynman, ότι «οι τυπικές διαδρομές των κβαντικών μηχανικών σωματιδίων είναι συνεχείς μη διαφοροποιήσιμες». Στη συνέχεια συνεχίζει την ανάπτυξη των φράκταλ ιδεών χωροχρόνου για να καταλήξει με: "Η κβαντική συμπεριφορά γίνεται, σε αυτή τη θεωρία, μια εκδήλωση της φράκταλ γεωμετρίας του χωροχρόνου, με τον ίδιο τρόπο η βαρύτητα είναι, στη θεωρία του Αϊνστάιν της γενικής (κίνησης-) σχετικότητας, μια εκδήλωση της καμπυλότητας του χωροχρόνου.<br/>Ένα άλλο βήμα προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση προέρχεται από το έργο των Ρώσων επιστημόνων - το οποίο ξεκίνησε με τις πιο πρωτότυπες ιδέες του Ν.Α. Κοζύρεφ [44]<br/>και Α. Ζαχάρωφ [45], και αναπτύσσεται στη Μόσχα, τα Ουράλια και τη Σιβηρία, βλ. π.χ. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Καλύτερη διατροφή και άσκηση για να χάσετε βάρος<br/><br/>Πώς είναι το πρωινό πραγματικά υγιεινό;<br/><br/>Το πρωί σαν αυτοκράτορας, το μεσημέρι σαν βασιλιάς, το βράδυ σαν ζητιάνος – πηγαίνει μια γνωστή παροιμία. Μια μελέτη της ιατρικής οργάνωσης Ενδοκρινική Εταιρεία επιβεβαιώνει το βασικό μήνυμα πίσω από το ρητό: Δείχνει ότι το πρωινό παίζει σημαντικότερο ρόλο από ό,τι συχνά υποθέτουμε. Το πρωί, το ανθρώπινο σώμα έχει στην πραγματικότητα πάνω από διπλάσια μεταβολική δραστηριότητα από άλλες ώρες της ημέρας: Ένα μεγάλο πρωινό όχι μόνο σας κρατά γεμάτο για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα, το σάκχαρο του αίματος και τα επίπεδα ινσουλίνης αυξάνονται επίσης αργά. Η όρεξη για γλυκά ρυθμίζεται, τρώμε σνακ λιγότερο συχνά κατά τη διάρκεια της ημέρας. Επομένως, το πρωινό δεν πρέπει να παραλείπεται ακόμη και κατά τη διάρκεια μιας δίαιτας.<br/><br/>Φυσικά, το να έχουμε ένα μεγάλο πρωινό δεν σημαίνει ότι θα πρέπει να έχουμε αρκετά κρουασάν με κρέμα nut nougat και γλυκές τηγανίτες πρωινού το πρωί. Το πρωινό είναι πιο υγιεινό όταν έχει υψηλή περιεκτικότητα σε πρωτεΐνες και φυτικές ίνες, καθώς και παρέχει βιταμίνες και μέταλλα. Ολόκληρο ψωμί σιτηρών ή μουεσλί, νιφάδες βρώμης, φρούτα και ξηροί καρποί είναι προμηθευτές ενέργειας που είναι καλοί για εσάς και σας κρατούν χορτάτους για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα.<br/><br/>Το γεγονός ότι ένα μεγάλο πρωινό είναι καλύτερο από ένα μεγάλο δείπνο δεν σημαίνει απαραίτητα ότι το πρωινό είναι απαραίτητο για την απώλεια βάρους. Μια μετα-ανάλυση που πραγματοποιήθηκε το 2019 έδειξε, ότι η συνολική ημερήσια ενεργειακή πρόσληψη των ανθρώπων που τρώνε πρωινό είναι κατά μέσο όρο υψηλότερη, από εκείνη εκείνων που δεν έχουν πρωινό. Οι τελευταίοι ήταν κατά μέσο όρο λίγο κάτω από μισό κιλό ελαφρύτεροι. Έτσι, σύμφωνα με τα αποτελέσματα αυτής της σημαντικής μελέτης, δεν χρειάζεται απαραίτητα να φάτε πρωινό αν θέλετε να χάσετε βάρος.<br/><br/>Χάστε βάρος με τη σωστή διατροφή – αυτό είναι το πόσο εύκολο είναι να βάλετε υγιή στο πιάτο σας<br/><br/>Τρώγοντας υγιεινά σε καμία περίπτωση δεν σημαίνει λιγότερη γεύση. Φρέσκα λαχανικά, ψάρια ή κρέας ως πηγές πρωτεϊνών και άλλα υγιεινά συστατικά επικαλούνται γεύση στην κατσαρόλα και ένα χαμόγελο στα χείλη σας – ιδανικά επίσης όταν πατάτε στη ζυγαριά. Μια αμερικανική μελέτη έχει δείξει ότι οι άνθρωποι που μαγειρεύουν το δικό τους φαγητό και ασχολούνται συνειδητά με αυτό που τρώνε έχουν δείκτη μάζας σώματος στο φυσιολογικό εύρος. Επισκέψεις σε εστιατόρια ή fast food, από την άλλη πλευρά, γρήγορα σας παρασύρουν στην παγίδα της ζάχαρης: Συχνά δεν υπάρχει καμία ένδειξη για το πόσο ζάχαρη υπάρχει στις σάλτσες σαλάτας, πόσο λίπος είχαν τηγανίσει οι πατάτες ή αν το κρέας δεν είχε υποστεί επεξεργασία.<br/><br/>Ένα υγιεινό γεύμα αποτελείται από τρία μέρη – το μεγαλύτερο μέρος είναι φρούτα ή λαχανικά και θα πρέπει να καλύπτει το μισό πιάτο. Το ένα τέταρτο του γεύματος θα πρέπει να αποτελείται από πρωτεΐνες, δηλαδή ψάρι, κρέας ή τόφου. Το υπόλοιπο τέταρτο αποτελείται από υδατάνθρακες και είναι ιδανικά κατασκευασμένο από προϊόντα ολικής αλέσεως. Σημαντικό: Μην τρώτε στο γραφείο σας στο γραφείο, αλλά τονώστε το μεταβολισμό σας και ιδανικά κάντε ένα σύντομο περίπατο πριν ή μετά το μεσημεριανό γεύμα.<br/><br/>Πότε πρέπει να τρώτε για να χάσετε βάρος;<br/><br/>Το βράδυ, θα πρέπει να επικεντρωθείτε σε ελαφρά γεύματα που είναι μάλλον χαμηλά σε υδατάνθρακες. Αυτά είναι τα λιγότερο πιθανό να προκαλέσουν την αύξηση της ινσουλίνης, κάτι που είναι καλό για το σώμα μας. Τα λαχανικά, τα γαλακτοκομικά προϊόντα και οι ξηροί καρποί, για παράδειγμα, είναι κατάλληλα για αυτό.<br/><br/>Θα πρέπει επίσης να είστε προσεκτικοί για να μην δειπνήσετε πολύ αργά. Είναι καλύτερο να έχετε φάει μέχρι τις 7 μ.μ. – τότε το σώμα μπορεί να χαλαρώσει και να προετοιμαστεί για τη νύχτα. Ο επαρκής ύπνος είναι σημαντικός για την υγιή απώλεια βάρους. Μια μελέτη στις ΗΠΑ διαπίστωσε ότι οι άνθρωποι που κοιμόντουσαν περίπου οκτώ ώρες τη νύχτα είχαν καλύτερα αποθέματα λίπους. Έτσι καληνύχτα! Αφήστε τον εαυτό σας πάνω από έξι ώρες ύπνου, έτσι ώστε να μπορείτε να ξεκινήσετε την επόμενη μέρα να ταιριάζει και να αναζωογονηθεί.<br/><br/>Απώλεια βάρους χωρίς άσκηση – είναι πραγματικά δυνατή;<br/><br/>Θα ήταν τόσο εύκολο, αν το βάρος των ονείρων μπορούσε να επιτευχθεί απλά με τη μείωση της πρόσληψης θερμίδων. Αλλά πιθανότατα γνωρίζετε τη σοφία ότι η διατροφή είναι μόνο η μία πλευρά του νομίσματος και η άσκηση είναι η άλλη. Έτσι τίποτα δεν βοηθά: Βάλτε τα αθλητικά σας και φύγετε!<br/><br/>Όποιος, εκτός από το αθλητικό πρόγραμμα όπως το τζόκινγκ, το περπάτημα ή το κολύμπι, αφήνει επίσης το ασανσέρ να πάει μόνος του και να πάρει τις σκάλες, κάνει μια μικρή παράκαμψη ή χρησιμοποιεί το ποδήλατο αντί για το αυτοκίνητο, τα πάει καλάαποκαλείται και κάτι καλό. Ακόμη και το απλό περπάτημα κάνει καλό στην υγεία. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Γιατί ανοίγουμε τον εξυπηρετητή εφαρμογών Anvil<br/><br/>Γιατί Ανοιχτός Κώδικας;<br/><br/>Πριν από λίγο καιρό, ανοίξαμε τον Anvil App Server. Η αντίδραση της κοινότητας ήταν μεγάλη, έστω και λίγο συντριπτική (ναι, κάθε απάντηση σε αυτή την ανακοίνωση πραγματικά προσγειώθηκε στα εισερχόμενά μου!). Έχουμε ήδη ενσωματώσει ένα σωρό από αυτά τα σχόλια στην έκδοση 1.2 μας. Αλλά συνεχίζουμε να μας ρωτούν, "Γιατί ανοίξατε έναν τέτοιο πυρήνα του προϊόντος σας; "<br/><br/>Γιατί το κάνεις αυτό;<br/><br/>Το Anvil είναι ένα εργαλείο που καθιστά όσο το δυνατόν πιο απλή την κατασκευή μιας web εφαρμογής. Το κάνουμε αυτό δίνοντάς σας τη δυνατότητα να κατασκευάσετε ολόκληρη την εφαρμογή σε μία γλώσσα, την Python.<br/><br/>Η απλή φιλοξενία είναι μέρος αυτού.<br/><br/>Η διαδικτυακή πλατφόρμα είναι σπασμένη , και το Anvil είναι η προσπάθειά μας να την διορθώσουμε. και, επειδή υπάρχει τόση πολυπλοκότητα στην ανάπτυξη μιας διαδικτυακής εφαρμογής, μια υπηρεσία που φιλοξενείται από το cloud ήταν ο καλύτερος τρόπος για να παρέχουμε την απλότητα που θέλουμε. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο, μπορείτε να δημιουργήσετε την εφαρμογή σας στον Επεξεργαστή Anvil, και να την κάνετε να ζήσει στο Διαδίκτυο με ένα κλικ.<br/><br/>Αλλά συνεχίζαμε να ακούμε από ανθρώπους που έλεγαν, "Αυτό είναι υπέροχο, αλλά..."<br/><br/>"...αλλά πρέπει να το τρέξω σε μια υπεράκτια πλατφόρμα χωρίς αξιόπιστη πρόσβαση στο διαδίκτυο"<br/><br/>"...αλλά θέλω να συσκευάσω την εφαρμογή μου σε μια συσκευή IoT που πουλάω"<br/><br/>ή απλά, "...αλλά αν βάζω τα αυγά μου σε αυτό το καλάθι, πώς μπορώ να είμαι σίγουρος ότι μπορώ ακόμα να τρέξω την εφαρμογή μου σε δέκα χρόνια;"<br/><br/>Αυτά είναι όλα καλά σημεία! Μια υπηρεσία cloud δεν είναι η σωστή λύση για όλους. Αν θέλουμε να εξυπηρετήσουμε αυτούς τους χρήστες, πρέπει να υπάρχει κάποιος τρόπος για να βγάλουν τις εφαρμογές τους από το Anvil και να τις τρέξουν τοπικά, υπό τον δικό τους πλήρη έλεγχο.<br/><br/>Open Source: Εκκόλαψη διαφυγής, όχι κάθισμα εκτίναξης<br/><br/>Πιστεύουμε στις καταπακτές διαφυγής, όχι στις θέσεις εκτίναξης. Στα συνέδρια, μερικές φορές μας ρωτούν, "μπορώ να εξάγω αυτό ως εφαρμογή Flask+JS;". Σίγουρα, θα ήταν δυνατό – θα μπορούσαμε να δημιουργήσουμε ένα πακέτο διακομιστή, να μεταγλωττίσουμε το client-side Python σε Javascript, και να φτύσουμε μια κλασική web εφαρμογή. Αλλά θα είχε σοβαρά μειονεκτήματα, επειδή:<br/><br/>Δεν είναι μια άνετη βόλτα.<br/><br/>Η παραγωγή κώδικα είναι ένα κάθισμα εκτίναξης. Ο κώδικας που δημιουργείται είναι καλύτερος από το τίποτα – τουλάχιστον μπορείτε να τον επεξεργαστείτε! Αλλά τη στιγμή που επεξεργάζεστε αυτόν τον κώδικα, χάνετε όλα τα οφέλη του συστήματος που τον δημιούργησε. Αν χρησιμοποιείτε το Anvil λόγω του επεξεργαστή drag-and-drop και του Python στο πρόγραμμα περιήγησης, γιατί θα πρέπει οι τοπικοί μας χρήστες να χρησιμοποιούν vim και Javascript;<br/><br/>Έτσι το κάναμε με τον σωστό τρόπο: ανοίξαμε την μηχανή χρόνου εκτέλεσης του Anvil. Είναι ο ίδιος κώδικας που εξυπηρετεί την εφαρμογή σας στην φιλοξενούμενη υπηρεσία μας, και αντιπροσωπεύει την εφαρμογή σας με τον ίδιο τρόπο. Μπορείτε να επεξεργαστείτε τον κώδικά σας με ένα πρόγραμμα επεξεργασίας κειμένου, να τον εκτελέσετε, στη συνέχεια git σπρώξτε τον πίσω στο online IDE μας. Δεν είναι ένα κάθισμα εκτίναξης: δεν υπάρχει εκρηκτική μετάβαση. Είναι μια καταπακτή διαφυγής: μπορείτε να ανεβείτε έξω, και να ανεβείτε αμέσως πίσω.<br/><br/>Και το επιχειρηματικό μας μοντέλο;<br/><br/>Το Anvil δεν προοριζόταν ποτέ να είναι ένα από εκείνα τα συστήματα εταιρικού χαμηλού κώδικα που σας χρεώνουν $20/mo για κάθε άτομο που χρησιμοποιεί την εφαρμογή σας. Το Anvil είναι ένα εργαλείο προγραμματιστή. Οι εφαρμογές που αναπτύσσετε είναι δικές σας. Το να σου επιτρέψω να τα τρέξεις σε ένα Βατόμουρο Πι είναι ωραίο, αλλά δεν αλλάζει το επιχειρηματικό μας μοντέλο.<br/><br/>Κάνουμε αυτό που πάντα ήμασταν: Κατασκευάζουμε και πουλάμε ένα εργαλείο ανάπτυξης που το κάνει δραστικά απλούστερο στην κατασκευή εφαρμογών ιστού. Παρέχουμε φιλοξενία για εφαρμογές Anvil. Προσφέρουμε ολόκληρη την πλατφόρμα ανάπτυξης και φιλοξενίας για εταιρικούς πελάτες. Και, φυσικά, προσφέρουμε ένα δωρεάν σχέδιο έτσι ώστε ο καθένας να μπορεί να χρησιμοποιήσει το Anvil για χόμπι ή εκπαιδευτικούς σκοπούς – ή να αρχίσει να χτίζει κάτι και να δει πώς θα πάει.<br/><br/>Ανοίξαμε τον εξυπηρετητή εφαρμογών Anvil για τον (σχετικά μικρό) αριθμό ατόμων που τον χρειάζονται, και για να παρέχουμε την απόλυτη ασφάλεια. Σίγουρα, μπορείτε να φτιάξετε μια εφαρμογή με vim και να την φιλοξενήσετε μόνοι σας, χωρίς καν να κάνετε εγγραφή σε λογαριασμό μας (έχουμε docs για να σας δείξουμε πώς!). Αλλά ο Επεξεργαστής Anvil είναι ο ευκολότερος τρόπος στον κόσμο για να οικοδομήσουμε μια εφαρμογή ιστού και η φιλοξενούμενη υπηρεσία μας είναι ο ευκολότερος τρόπος για να την αναπτύξουμε – έτσι αυτό είναι που περιμένουμε από τους περισσότερους από τους χρήστες μας να συνεχίσουν να κάνουν. Και μπορείς να χτίσεις με αυτοπεποίθηση, γνωρίζοντας ότι ο κώδικας ανοιχτού κώδικα είναι εκεί αν τον χρειαστείς.<br/><br/>Δοκίμασέ το μόνος σου.<br/><br/>Αν η αναπτυξιακή μας φιλοσοφία αντηχεί μαζί σου, γιατί δεν δοκιμάζεις τον Ανβίλ μόνος σου; |
