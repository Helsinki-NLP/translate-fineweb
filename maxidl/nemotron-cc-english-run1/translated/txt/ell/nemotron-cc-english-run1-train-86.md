| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N.

Εφημερίδες και περιοδικά σε όλες τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες και την Ευρώπη ανέφεραν το πείραμα Leclaire, ιδιαίτερα κατά τα πρώτα 20 χρόνια της ύπαρξής του. Το 1979, λόγω της μοναδικής ιστορίας του, το πρώην χωριό καταχωρήθηκε στο Εθνικό Μητρώο Ιστορικών Τοποθεσιών.<br/><br/>Η Leclaire ιδρύθηκε από τον Νέλσον Όλιβερ Νέλσον, έναν κατασκευαστή υδραυλικών του Σαιντ Λούις ο οποίος, για πολλά χρόνια, επεδίωκε να προωθήσει τη δεινή θέση της εργατικής τάξης. Ο Νέλσον ήθελε να βελτιώσει τις συνθήκες εργασίας για τους υπαλλήλους του και να παρέχει στέγαση κοντά στα εργοστάσια, ώστε οι εργαζόμενοι και οι οικογένειές τους να μπορούν εύκολα να συμμετέχουν σε ψυχαγωγικά και εκπαιδευτικά προγράμματα που προσφέρονται δωρεάν από την εταιρεία. Πριν από το 1890, ενώ βρισκόταν ακόμα στο Σαιντ Λούις, οι επιχειρήσεις κατασκευής και διανομής της N. O. Nelson Company άρχισαν να παρέχουν διαμοιρασμό κερδών μαζί με εκπαιδευτικές και ψυχαγωγικές ευκαιρίες. Το πείραμα συνεργασίας Leclaire θα έφερνε πρόσθετα οφέλη.<br/><br/>Όταν οι υπάλληλοι του Νέλσον ανέφεραν ότι ήθελαν να μετεγκατασταθούν σε μια αγροτική τοποθεσία, οι εκπρόσωποι των εταιρειών προσέγγισαν ηγέτες μικρών πόλεων σε αρκετές κοινότητες του Μιζούρι και του Ιλινόις κοντά στην έδρα τους στο Σεντ Λούις. Έψαχναν για μια κατάλληλη ιδιοκτησία για να χτίσουν νέα εργοστάσια και ένα πρότυπο χωριό. Νότια του Έντουαρντσβιλ βρήκαν μια έκταση γης 125 στρεμμάτων με πρόσβαση σε νερό, κάρβουνο και μεταφορές. Οι τοπικοί επιχειρηματίες ενήργησαν γρήγορα για να προσφέρουν ένα οικονομικό κίνητρο. Σε λιγότερο από τρεις εβδομάδες, η κοινότητα συγκέντρωσε ένα ταμείο 20.000 δολαρίων από μεμονωμένες συνεισφορές μεταξύ 1 και 1.000 δολαρίων για να δελεάσει τον Νέλσον να επιλέξει το Έντουαρντσβιλ για την επιχείρησή του.<br/><br/>Οι ηγέτες της πόλης ήλπιζαν να εντοπίσουν ιδιοκτησία μέσα στα όρια της πόλης του Έντουαρντσβιλ, αλλά όταν δεν βρέθηκε κατάλληλη τοποθεσία, ήταν σίγουροι ότι η επένδυση Νέλσον νότια της πόλης θα γινόταν σύντομα μέρος του Έντουαρντσβιλ. Αν και ο Νέλσον εκπλήρωσε όλες τις απρόβλεπτες συνθήκες για την κατασκευή και τη δημιουργία θέσεων εργασίας στο συμβόλαιό του, θα ήταν 44 χρόνια πριν από την προσάρτηση στο Έντουαρντσβιλ. Το Λεκλαίρ, οριοθετημένο από τις λεωφόρους Μάντισον/Μπράουν στα ανατολικά, τις σιδηροδρομικές γραμμές στα δυτικά, τις λεωφόρους Χάντλεϊ/ΜκΚίνλεϊ στα νότια και την οδό Γουλφ στα βόρεια, παρέμεινε ανεξάρτητο χωριό από το 1890 έως το 1934. Κατά τη διάρκεια αυτής της περιόδου κέρδισε μια φήμη για καινοτομίες στις επιχειρήσεις, την εκπαίδευση και τον οικιστικό σχεδιασμό.<br/><br/>Το χωριό Λεκλαίρ σε χάρτη του 1931 του Έντουαρντσβιλ<br/>Ευγενής παραχώρηση από Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Η απόφαση του Νέλσον να χτίσει ένα χωριό δεν έγινε με καπρίτσιο. Μέχρι τα τέλη της δεκαετίας του 1880 ήταν διεθνής ηγέτης στους τομείς της συνεργασίας και του διαμοιρασμού των κερδών, ανταλλάσσοντας κοινωνικές θεωρίες με άλλους σε όλο τον κόσμο ενώ επέκτεινε την επιχείρησή του στο Σαιντ Λούις. Ονόμασε το πειραματικό χωριό του από τον παριζιάνικο κερδοφόρο, Εντμέ Ζαν Λεκλαίρ, αλλά επισκέφθηκε πολλούς άλλους κοινωνικούς οραματιστές που παρείχαν πληροφορίες και έμπνευση. Συνδυάζοντας τις καλύτερες ιδέες από αυτά τα παραδείγματα, ο Νέλσον ίδρυσε τον Λεκλαίρ για να "δώσει δουλειά, να προωθήσει τη νοημοσύνη, να παρέχει αναψυχή, να αναθρέψει την ομορφιά και να κάνει σπίτια". Αυτοί ήταν όλοι οι παράγοντες που καθόρισε απαραίτητοι για να ζήσουν οι άνθρωποι εκπληρώνοντας τη ζωή τους. Οι μεταγενέστεροι συγγραφείς χρησιμοποίησαν αυτές τις λέξεις για να διατυπώσουν τις ιδρυτικές αρχές του Λεκλαίρ: Εργασία, Σπίτια, Εκπαίδευση, Αναψυχή και Ομορφιά, αλλά με την επιπρόσθετη σημαντική αρχή της Ελευθερίας.<br/><br/>Εργασία<br/><br/>Η εργασία θα μπορούσε να θεωρηθεί ο σημαντικότερος από αυτούς τους παράγοντες αφού χωρίς τις εργοστασιακές εργασίες στο Λεκλαίρ, δεν θα υπήρχε χωριό. Τα κτίρια του εργοστασίου τούβλων σχεδιάστηκαν από τον αρχιτέκτονα Ε. Α. Κάμερον για να παρέχουν φυσικό φως, εξαερισμό το καλοκαίρι και θερμαινόμενα πατώματα το χειμώνα. Υπήρχε σύστημα καταστολής της πυρκαγιάς και, αν και τα βιομηχανικά ατυχήματα δεν εξαλείφθηκαν, καταβλήθηκε κάθε δυνατή προσπάθεια για την εγγύηση της ασφάλειας των εργαζομένων. Τα κτίρια από τούβλα καλυμμένα με κισσό περιβαλλόταν από περιποιημένους χλοοτάπητες και ανθόκηπους δίνοντας στο συγκρότημα μια εμφάνιση που έμοιαζε με πανεπιστημιούπολη. Το 1894, η δημοσιογράφος του New York World Nellie Bly αποκάλεσε τα κτίρια "την ιδανική τελειότητα των κτιρίων για να εργαστεί ο άνθρωπος".<br/><br/>Το κατασκευαστικό συγκρότημα της N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company στο Λεκλαίρ<br/>Από τους Φίλους του Λεκλαίρ<br/><br/>Οι πολιτικές της εταιρείας Νέλσον σχεδιάστηκαν για να προστατεύσουν την οικονομική σταθερότητα των εργαζομένων.Οι εργαζόμενοι θα μπορούσαν να κερδίσουν ένα μερίδιο από τα κέρδη και να έχουν φωνή στην εταιρεία αν επέλεγαν αυτή την επιλογή. Το σχέδιο διαμοιρασμού των κερδών έδωσε στους εργαζόμενους του Νέλσον ένα καμάρι ιδιοκτησίας που είχε ως αποτέλεσμα ένα υποστηρικτικό εργατικό δυναμικό. Οι εργαζόμενοι είχαν επίσης λογικές ώρες και ανταγωνιστικούς μισθούς.Υπήρχε ένα ταμείο πρόνοιας που προέβλεπε συντάξεις και αναρρωτική άδεια, καθώς και συντάξεις χηρών αν πέθαινε ένας εργαζόμενος, ανεξάρτητα από το αν ο θάνατος σχετιζόταν ή όχι με την απασχόλησή του.<br/><br/>Η έδρα της εταιρείας για την N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) παρέμεινε στο Σαιντ Λούις, αλλά όλη η N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company μεταφέρθηκε στο Leclaire. Η κατασκευαστική εταιρεία χωρίστηκε σε καταστήματα που έφτιαχναν μια ποικιλία προϊόντων. Το 1900, τα καταστήματα έγιναν ανεξάρτητες εταιρείες για φορολογικούς σκοπούς, αλλά όλα εξακολουθούσαν να ανήκουν στην Εταιρεία Παραγωγής Ν. Ο. Νέλσον. Τα καταστήματα περιελάμβαναν τον Μύλο του Υπουργικού Συμβουλίου όπου παράγονταν προϊόντα ξύλου από ντουλάπια έως ελαιοτριβεία. Οι ειδικευμένοι τεχνίτες που εργάζονταν εδώ εκπλήρωσαν επίσης ειδικές συμβάσεις, συμπεριλαμβανομένων κλωβών ταμίας για μια τοπική τράπεζα και ένα βωμό που εξακολουθεί να χρησιμοποιείται στην Επισκοπική Εκκλησία του Αγίου Ανδρέα στο Edwardsville. Το Μαρμάρινο Κατάστημα ειδικεύτηκε στο αρχιτεκτονικό μάρμαρο που κόπηκε και εγκαταστάθηκε από τα πληρώματα του Νέλσον σε σπίτια, επιχειρήσεις, ακόμη και σε πολιτειακές καπιτώλες σε όλη τη Μεσοδυτική. Το Μηχανουργείο, το οποίο έγινε το Μπιγκνάλ και το Κίλερ, κατασκεύαζε μηχανές τοποθέτησης σωλήνων, αντλίες, μετρητές και διάφορα μηχανικά εργαλεία που αναμενόταν στο εμπόριο υδραυλικών. Το Brass Shop περιελάμβανε ένα χυτήριο όπου κατασκευάζονταν διάφοροι υδραυλικοί σωλήνες και εργαλεία. Το λογότυπο της εταιρείας ήταν ένα στυλιζαρισμένο "NONCO" που μπορεί ακόμα να δει κανείς σε υδραυλικά και μερικούς πυροσβεστικούς κρουνούς στο Edwardsville σήμερα.<br/><br/>Σπίτια<br/><br/>Πριν από την κατασκευή των σπιτιών, χρειαζόταν στέγαση για τους εργαζόμενους που ολοκλήρωναν τα κτίρια του εργοστασίου καθώς και για την κατασκευή κατοικιών. Για την κάλυψη αυτών των αναγκών, η εταιρεία έχτισε το "Club House", ένα μεγάλο κτίριο που εξυπηρετούσε πολλούς σκοπούς. Εκτός από τη διαμονή, ήταν το πρώτο εκπαιδευτικό κτίριο της κοινότητας, και περιείχε μια καλά εφοδιασμένη βιβλιοθήκη.<br/><br/>Η κατασκευή του οικιστικού τμήματος του Λεκλαίρ ξεκίνησε αμέσως μετά την ίδρυση του χωριού τον Ιούνιο του 1890. Ο Τζούλιους Πίτζμαν, ο καινοτόμος αρχιτέκτονας τοπίων που ετοίμασε τις πρώτες παρτίδες στο Λεκλαίρ, τις έστησε με μια σειρά προστατευτικών διαθηκών. Οι διαθήκες προέβλεπαν φαρδιούς, καμπυλόγραμμους δρόμους, μεγάλες παρτίδες και έναν περιορισμό πράξεων που περιόριζε τις ιδιοκτησίες σε οικιστικούς ή εκπαιδευτικούς σκοπούς μόνο. Η εταιρεία άνοιξε τους δρόμους, παρείχε ηλεκτρικά φώτα στους δρόμους, εγκατέστησε πεζοδρόμια και φύτεψε εκατοντάδες δέντρα κατά μήκος των δρόμων του Λεκλαίρ. Μεταγενέστερα τμήματα του Leclaire διατυπώθηκαν με συμβατικό σχεδιασμό πλέγματος και μικρότερες παρτίδες, αλλά εξακολουθούσαν να περιλαμβάνουν τους περιορισμούς της πράξης.<br/><br/>Ένα βικτοριανό εξοχικό σπίτι Leclaire το 1907<br/>Από τη Σίντι Ράινχαρτ<br/><br/>Αρχικά τα σπίτια χτίστηκαν από την εταιρεία και στη συνέχεια πωλήθηκαν με σχεδόν κόστος στους υπαλλήλους του Νέλσον για να ενθαρρύνουν την ιδιοκτησία του σπιτιού. Τα σπίτια προσφέρονταν σε μια ποικιλία σχεδίων σπιτιών και η εταιρεία διαφήμιζε ότι δεν υπήρχαν δύο κατοικίες ίδιες. Τα πρώτα σπίτια ήταν κυρίως βικτωριανές εξοχικές κατοικίες που έρχονταν με ηλεκτρικό ρεύμα και τρεχούμενο νερό. Ακολούθησαν μπανγκαλόου, τετράγωνες, ακόμη και μερικά κιτ σπίτια. Οι κάτοικοι μπορούσαν να αγοράσουν ένα σπίτι που είχε κατασκευαστεί από εταιρεία ή να αγοράσουν ένα άδειο οικόπεδο και να χτίσουν ένα σπίτι οι ίδιοι, υπό την προϋπόθεση ότι ο αρχιτεκτονικός σχεδιασμός πληρούσε τα πρότυπα της εταιρείας.<br/><br/>Στα μετέπειτα χρόνια, πωλήθηκαν παρτίδες σε επενδυτές, συνήθως κατοίκους του Edwardsville, και πολλά σπίτια στη δεκαετία του 1920 χτίστηκαν από τοπικούς εργολάβους που στη συνέχεια τα πωλούσαν σε κατοίκους της περιοχής.<br/><br/>Εκπαίδευση<br/><br/>Ο Νέλσον πίστευε στην εκπαίδευση για όλους, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της εργατικής τάξης.Ο εκπαιδευτικός προγραμματισμός ξεκίνησε με ένα νηπιαγωγείο στο Club House το 1892 και συνεχίστηκε στο νέο εκπαιδευτικό κτίριο στο 722 Holyoake Road. Κοινώς ονομάζεται "Σχολικό Σπίτι", αυτό το κτίριο παρείχε μια μεγάλη αίθουσα για συναντήσεις και προγράμματα, αλλά είχε κινητά χωρίσματα για να το χωρίσουν σε χώρο στην τάξη κατά τη διάρκεια της ημέρας. Τα βράδια, υπήρχαν χοροί, συναντήσεις, ή προγράμματα του Leclaire Self-Culture Club που παρουσίαζαν εβδομαδιαίες διαλέξεις από καθηγητές του Πανεπιστημίου της Ουάσινγκτον ή εθνικά γνωστούς ομιλητές που, όπως ο Ν. Ο. Νέλσον, ήταν μέρος του κινήματος κοινωνικής βελτίωσης στις αρχές του αιώνα. Μεταξύ αυτών ήταν η Τζέιν Άνταμς, ο Έντουαρντ Έβερετ Χέιλ, ο Σάμιουελ "Χρυσός Κανόνας" Τζόουνς και η συγγραφέας Σάρλοτ Πέρκινς Γκίλμαν, μεταξύ άλλων.<br/><br/>Παιδιά εγγράφηκε στο νηπιαγωγείο Leclaire το 1913<br/>Από τη Σίντι Ράινχαρτ<br/><br/>Στα δέκα χρόνια που ακολούθησαν την κατασκευή του εκπαιδευτικού κτιρίου το 1895, έγινε μια σειρά εκπαιδευτικών πειραμάτων, συμπεριλαμβανομένων μιας βιομηχανικής σχολής, κολεγίου, νυχτερινού σχολείου και μιας ακαδημίας. Η αρχαιότερη και μακροβιότερη προσπάθεια ήταν το πρωινό νηπιαγωγείο, που ιδρύθηκε το 1892, που χρησιμοποιούσε το μοντέλο Φράμπελ. Αυτό το διετές πρόγραμμα ήταν ελεύθερο σε όλους, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των παιδιών του Έντουαρντσβιλ, μέχρι το 1931 όταν για οικονομικούς λόγους η εταιρεία άρχισε να χρεώνει δίδακτρα σε φοιτητές που δεν ήταν παιδιά των εργαζομένων. Η Nelson Manufacturing λειτούργησε ένα νηπιαγωγείο μέχρι το 1934, όταν το κτίριο παραδόθηκε στην Σχολική Περιοχή Edwardsville με ονομαστική αμοιβή.<br/><br/>Αναψυχή<br/><br/>Σκάφη στη λίμνη Λεκλαίρ το 1915<br/>Από τη Σίντι Ράινχαρτ<br/><br/>Η αναψυχή ήταν ένα σημαντικό χαρακτηριστικό του Λεκλαίρ. Η εταιρεία παρείχε αθλητικές εγκαταστάσεις για μπέιζμπολ, τένις και αργότερα, ποδόσφαιρο. Κατασκευάστηκε μια αίθουσα μπόουλινγκ και μπιλιάρδου και υπήρχε μια λίμνη για βαρκάδα, κολύμπι, ψάρεμα ή πατινάζ στον πάγο το χειμώνα. Το πάρκο Leclaire ήταν επιπλωμένο με πλωτά σπίτια, ανδρικά & γυναικεία λουτρά, και ένα μεγάλο περίπτερο. Οι κάτοικοι οργάνωσαν χορούς, θυρίδες, ορθογραφίες μελισσών και άλλες δραστηριότητες, και η εταιρεία χρηματοδότησε ένα συγκρότημα που έπαιζε τακτικά σε διασκεδάσεις στο χωριό ή στο Edwardsville. Όπως και οι εκπαιδευτικές λειτουργίες στο Club House και το School House, οι ψυχαγωγικές εγκαταστάσεις στο Leclaire ήταν ανοιχτές σε όλους και συχνά αποτελούσαν προορισμό για τους επισκέπτες του Edwardsville και ακόμη και του St. Louis.<br/><br/>Ομορφιά<br/><br/>Πρώιμη φωτογραφία της λίμνης Λεκλαίρ<br/>Από τη Σίντι Ράινχαρτ<br/><br/>Ο τελευταίος από τους παράγοντες που ο Νέλσον θεωρούσε σημαντικούς για μια ικανοποιητική ζωή αφορούσε το περιβάλλον. Εκτιμούσε την ομορφιά και την καθαριότητα που θα μπορούσε να βρεθεί στη χώρα, και ενθάρρυνε όλους στο Λεκλαίρ να ομορφαίνουν την περιουσία τους φυτεύοντας κήπους και περιβόλια. Ο ίδιος ο Νέλσον οδηγήθηκε με το παράδειγμά του, έτσι μια εταιρεία θερμοκηπίων παρείχε δωρεάν λουλούδια και διεξάγονταν διαγωνισμοί για τις πιο όμορφες αυλές.<br/><br/>Ελευθερία<br/><br/>Το Συνεταιριστικό κατάστημα Leclaire<br/>Από τη Σίντι Ράινχαρτ<br/><br/>Ο Νέλσον απαρίθμησε πέντε ιδρυτικές αρχές για τον Λεκλαίρ, αλλά οι σύγχρονοι συγγραφείς προσθέτουν ένα έκτο: Ελευθερία. Όλα τα προγράμματα που προσέφερε η εταιρεία ήταν διαθέσιμα στους υπαλλήλους καθώς και στους κατοίκους της περιοχής, αλλά κανένα δεν ήταν υποχρεωτικό. Οι κάτοικοι του Λεκλαίρ μπορούσαν να εργαστούν για την Nelson Manufacturing ή αλλού, και οι εργαζόμενοι δεν είχαν καμία υποχρέωση να ζουν στο Λεκλαίρ. Η συμμετοχή σε ψυχαγωγικά και εκπαιδευτικά προγράμματα ήταν επίσης προαιρετική. Υπήρχε επίσης ένα κατάστημα της εταιρείας όπου οι εργαζόμενοι μπορούσαν να ψωνίζουν, αλλά σε αντίθεση με άλλες πόλεις της εταιρείας, κανείς δεν ήταν χρεωμένος στο κατάστημα της εταιρείας. Το κατάστημα Leclaire ήταν ένας συνεταιρισμός όπου τα μέλη χρεώνονταν δίκαιες τιμές αγοράς, αλλά στη συνέχεια πληρώνονταν τριμηνιαία μερίσματα.<br/><br/>Μια Διαφορετική Πόλη Εταιρείας<br/><br/>Όλα αυτά τα οφέλη έκαναν το Leclaire μοναδικό από άλλες πόλεις της εταιρείας.Αλλά υπήρξαν και μεμονωμένες περιπτώσεις όπου η εταιρεία έδειξε συμπόνια και φροντίδα για τους εργαζόμενους. Η εταιρεία έκλεισε τα εργοστάσια και προσέλαβε εκδρομικά τρένα για να μεταφέρει εργάτες και τις οικογένειές τους στο Σαιντ Λούις για μια μέρα στην Παγκόσμια Έκθεση του Σαιντ Λούις του 1904. Όταν τα χρήματα ήταν σφιχτά, ο Νέλσον τοποθετούσε περιστασιακά επιπλέον μετρητά σε κάθε φάκελο πληρωμής για να κάνει τη ζωή ευκολότερη για τους εργαζόμενους, και αν θέσπισε ένα πρόγραμμα με το οποίο οι άνδρες δεν συμφωνούσαν, το συζητούσαν και, όσο συχνά δεν το έκανε, ο Νέλσον θα αντιστρεφόταν.<br/><br/>Γεννημένος στο Λιλεσάντ της Νορβηγίας το 1841, ο Ν. Ο. Νέλσον ήταν ένας περίπλοκος άνθρωπος. Ήταν ένας καπιταλιστής που πίστευε στην ελεύθερη επιχείρηση, αλλά και ένας σοσιαλιστής, ακόλουθος του "Χρυσού Κανόνα", και ένας πατριώτης που υπηρέτησε για την Ένωση στον Εμφύλιο Πόλεμο. Μέχρι το 1900, ήταν πολυεκατομμυριούχος, αλλά μέχρι τη στιγμή του θανάτου του το 1922, τα είχε δώσει όλα για τη βελτίωση της εργατικής τάξης.<br/><br/>Αν και ο Λεκλαίρ δεν ήταν το μοναδικό κοινωνικό πείραμα του Νέλσον, θεωρείται το πιο επιτυχημένο του εγχείρημα. Άλλες μεγάλες προσπάθειες για κοινωνική βελτίωση περιελάμβαναν μια αλυσίδα συνεργαζόμενων παντοπωλείων στη Νέα Ορλεάνη, ένα νηπιαγωγείο για τα παιδιά των μαύρων εργαζομένων στο Bessemer του, Αλαμπάμα, εργοστάσια, και ένα σπίτι για τους υπαξιωματικούς στο Ίντιο της Καλιφόρνια.<br/><br/>Το Nelson's Village of Leclaire διακρίθηκε διεθνώς ως ένα αξιοσημείωτο και επιτυχημένο πείραμα. Περιγράφηκε στον Κόσμο της Νέας Υόρκης σε πολυάριθμες περιπτώσεις αλλά ιδιαίτερα από την δημοσιογράφο Nellie Bly το 1894 που έγραψε εκτενώς για την πρότυπη πόλη όπου "Το εργατικό ζήτημα λύνεται και όλοι είναι ευτυχισμένοι σε ένα μικρό χωριό κοντά στο Σαιντ Λούις". Η εφημερίδα Los Angeles Times ανέφερε επίσης τακτικά για τον Ν. Ο. Νέλσον, όπως και η εφημερίδα Chicago Daily Tribune και πολυάριθμες άλλες εκδόσεις.<br/><br/>Σε μια ομιλία του στον εορτασμό της 15ης επετείου του Λεκλαίρ το 1915, ο Νέλσον είπε, "Ο Λεκλαίρ σας προσφέρει μια ευρεία ανοιχτή φιλοξενία, και σας προσκαλεί να απολαύσετε σήμερα την ευκολία και την άνεση και την ομορφιά και την έμπνευση που απολαμβάνουμε κάθε μέρα." Περισσότερο από έναν αιώνα έχει περάσει από εκείνη την ημέρα, αλλά η πρόσκληση εξακολουθεί να ισχύει. Οι κάτοικοι και οι ερευνητές καλούνται να μάθουν για την ιστορία του Λεκλαίρ και να εξετάσουν τα μαθήματα που θα μπορούσαν να αντληθούν για τη βελτίωση των μελλοντικών γενεών.<br/><br/>Ένα από τα πρώην κτίρια του κατασκευαστικού συγκροτήματος το 2019, το οποίο τώρα χρησιμεύει ως το N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Συντάκτης Επισκέψεις μέσω Zoom ή Skype<br/><br/>Είμαι ενθουσιασμένος που θα επισκεφτώ με τους μαθητές σας μέσω του Zoom ή του Skype! Το Skype είναι μια εξαιρετική επιλογή για σχολεία/κλάσεις που δεν φέρνουν σε επαφή κατ' ιδίαν συγγραφείς, αλλά που θέλουν να εξερευνήσουν βιβλία και ποίηση, να συνδεθούν με έναν συγγραφέα, και να κάνουν one-on-one ερωτήσεις.<br/><br/>Κόστος<br/><br/>Προσφέρω επισκέψεις Zoom ή Skype διάρκειας 30-45 λεπτών με σχολεία για 125 δολάρια ανά συνεδρία (ή 200 δολάρια για δύο συνεδρίες που συμβαίνουν μέσα σε τρεις ώρες το πρωί ή το απόγευμα· 325 δολάρια για τρεις συνεδρίες σε μία ημέρα· 425 δολάρια για τέσσερις συνεδρίες σε μία ημέρα). Σε κάθε συνεδρία, προσπαθώ να κάνω τα παιδιά να συμμετέχουν όσο το δυνατόν πιο ενεργά. Όχι, δεν είναι το ίδιο είδος σύνδεσης με τις προσφορές προσωπικής επίσκεψης, αλλά μπορεί ακόμα να είναι έμπνευση και κίνητρο για τα παιδιά!<br/><br/>Τι Κάνω<br/><br/>Κάθε συνεδρία για έως και 50 μαθητές περιλαμβάνει:<br/><br/>5 λεπτά εγκατάστασης τεχνολογίας<br/><br/>3 τμήματα των 10 ish-minutes το καθένα - Μπορείτε να επιλέξετε από:<br/><br/>Πώς έγινα συγγραφέας<br/><br/>Γράφοντας αυτό το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο (επιλέγετε σε ποιο βιβλίο επικεντρώνομαι)<br/><br/>Διαβάζω (διαβάζω μερικά ποιήματα και τα παιδιά με βοηθούν να διαβάσω άλλα)<br/><br/>Παρουσίαση στην τάξη (οι μαθητές σας βάζουν για μένα μια ανάγνωση ή μια παράσταση, ένα πολύ εκτιμητικό κοινό!)<br/><br/>Γράφοντας ένα ποίημα μαζί<br/><br/>Συνεδρία ερωτήσεων και απαντήσεων<br/><br/>5 λεπτά περιτυλίγματος/αντίο<br/><br/>Συνομιλώ επίσης με τάξεις καθηγητών προ-υπηρεσίας ή ομάδες καθηγητών σε υπηρεσία σχετικά με την ποίηση και τη γραφή.<br/><br/>Συμβουλές για μια Μεγάλη Εικονική Επίσκεψη<br/><br/>Συμβουλές για μια Επιτυχημένη Εικονική Επίσκεψη<br/><br/>Ένας από τους στόχους μου για τις εικονικές σχολικές επισκέψεις είναι να αποτυπώσω τη διαδραστικότητα που κάνει τις προσωπικές επισκέψεις επιτυχημένες και διασκεδαστικές. Αλλά η αλήθεια είναι ότι μερικές φορές είναι δύσκολο να είσαι ουσιαστικά διαδραστικός! Ο συγχρονισμός μπορεί να μην συγχρονιστεί σωστά, πράγμα που κάνει την ανάγνωση μαζί μια πρόκληση, και είναι πραγματικά δύσκολο για μένα να ακούσω μεμονωμένους μαθητές εκτός αν έρθουν και μιλήσουν απευθείας στο μικρόφωνο/υπολογιστή. Αλλά μετά από κάποια δοκιμή και λάθος, ανακάλυψα μερικούς τρόπους για να έχουμε τις καλύτερες δυνατές εικονικές επισκέψεις. Εδώ είναι: 10 τρόποι για να κάνετε την επίσκεψή μου με τους μαθητές σας μια μεγάλη εμπειρία!<br/><br/>Πριν την επίσκεψη<br/><br/>Πάρτε τα παιδιά όσο το δυνατόν πιο ενθουσιασμένα για την επίσκεψη. Επισκεφθείτε την ιστοσελίδα μου μαζί τους. Διαβάστε μερικά από τα βιβλία μου μαζί τους. Συγκεντρώστε μερικές ερωτήσεις που έχουν οι μαθητές για μένα. Ό,τι κι αν κάνετε εκ των προτέρων για να το κάνετε να φαίνεται σαν μια ΜΕΓΑΛΗ ΔΙΑΘΗΚΗ θα προχωρήσει πολύ προς την εμπλοκή των μαθητών.<br/><br/>Τοποθέτηση της βιντεοκάμερας ή του φορητού υπολογιστή με webcam ώστε να μπορώ να δω όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερο το κοινό. Είναι δύσκολο να εκτιμήσω την εμπλοκή των μαθητών όταν μπορώ να δω μόνο δύο μαθητές.<br/><br/>Περιορίστε κάθε ομάδα σε 50 μαθητές. Είναι απίστευτα δύσκολο να εμπλέξετε μεγάλες ομάδες μέσω βίντεο.<br/><br/>Θα κινηθώ γρήγορα από θέμα σε θέμα ή ποίημα σε ποίημα. Παρακαλώ υπενθυμίστε στους μαθητές ότι θα πρέπει να ακούσουν προσεκτικά για να καταλάβουν τι συμβαίνει.<br/><br/>Περιστασιακά, κάνω ένα μικρό Reader's Theater με μαθητές. Αν σας στείλω κάποια σεναριοποιημένα τμήματα μαθητών εκ των προτέρων, εκτυπώστε ένα αντίγραφο για κάθε συνεδρία και κομμένα σε κομμάτια, αν χρειαστεί.<br/><br/>Κατά τη διάρκεια της επίσκεψης<br/><br/>Όταν συζητώ για ένα βιβλίο, αν έχετε αυτό το τυπωμένο βιβλίο, παρακαλώ κρατήστε το ψηλά για να το δουν οι μαθητές.<br/><br/>Είσαι ο πληρεξούσιος μου. Συχνά δεν μπορώ να καλέσω τους μαθητές και να ακούσω μεμονωμένες απαντήσεις. Έτσι, θα μπορούσα να πω, "Θα πάρουμε 3 ιδέες. Σηκώστε το χέρι σας αν έχετε μια ιδέα." Τότε αναλάβετε εσείς, καλέστε τρεις μαθητές, και αναγγείλετε αυτές τις απαντήσεις σε όλους στο δωμάτιο και σε μένα.<br/><br/>Επιλέξτε με αυτοπεποίθηση, εξερχόμενους μαθητές για τα σεναριοποιημένα τμήματα των μαθητών (αν στείλω κάποιο εκ των προτέρων). Κατά τη διάρκεια των προσωπικών μου σχολικών επισκέψεων, προσπαθώ να τραβήξω μερικούς από τους λιγότερο σίγουρους μαθητές, αλλά έχω διαπιστώσει ότι αυτό δεν λειτουργεί τόσο καλά κατά τη διάρκεια εικονικών επισκέψεων επειδή δεν μπορώ να τους ακούσω.<br/><br/>Να έχετε μαθητές με ομιλούντα μέρη να κάθονται μπροστά, όταν έρθει η ώρα, να τους σηκώνεστε και να τους υπενθυμίζετε να μιλούν δυνατά.<br/><br/>Στις εικονικές επισκέψεις, η διαχείριση της συμπεριφοράς πέφτει αποκλειστικά πάνω σου. συχνά δεν μπορώ να δω ακριβώς τι συμβαίνει, γι' αυτό παρακαλώ περάστε όπως χρειάζεται. Αν υπάρχει μεγάλη αναστάτωση, απλά ζήτα μου να κρατηθώ για μια στιγμή ώστε να μην φλυαρώ ενώ κανείς δεν δίνει σημασία:>)<br/><br/>Αισθανθείτε ελεύθεροι να τραβήξετε φωτογραφίες μου στην οθόνη και να τις μοιραστείτε στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης-αν και οι φωτογραφίες μου συχνά φαίνονται γελοίες επειδή κάνω αστεία πρόσωπα ή κάτι τέτοιο ενώ διαβάζω!<br/><br/>Αν έχετε οποιεσδήποτε ερωτήσεις, παρακαλώ κάντε τις, είτε πριν είτε κατά τη διάρκεια της επίσκεψης!<br/><br/>Προγραμματισμός μιας εικονικής συνεδρίας<br/><br/>Σας ενδιαφέρει να προγραμματίσετε μια εικονική επίσκεψη μαζί μου; Απλά στείλτε μου email για να κανονίσουμε μια ημερομηνία, και θα πάμε από εκεί |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Αρχείο ειδήσεων<br/><br/>Νέο βιβλίο εξετάζει τρόπους αντιμετώπισης των HIV-προκλήσεων<br/><br/>2011-11-29 (στα Αγγλικά).<br/><br/>Ο καθηγητής Ντένις Φράνσις με την Marjorie Human που σχεδίασε το εξώφυλλο του βιβλίου, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>Η πανδημία του HIV έχει αναδείξει τα καλύτερα και τα χειρότερα στους ανθρώπους όσον αφορά την ανταπόκριση. αφενός έχει προκαλέσει στίγμα και βία και αφετέρου έχει επιφέρει εποικοδομητικές και υποστηρικτικές απαντήσεις από διάφορα άτομα και ομάδες. Ένα νέο βιβλίο, το Acting on HIV, το οποίο επιμελήθηκε ο καθηγητής Ντένις Φράνσις, κοσμήτορας της Σχολής Εκπαίδευσης στο Πανεπιστήμιο του Ελεύθερου Κράτους, εξετάζει πώς το δράμα μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για την προώθηση ζωτικών κοινωνικών αλλαγών καθώς και ατομικών αλλαγών συμπεριφοράς.<br/><br/>Η δράση για τον HIV προσφέρει μια συστηματική διερεύνηση του δράματος ως μια προσέγγιση για τη συζήτηση του HIV/AIDS και των σχετικών στάσεων και συμπεριφορών. Το βιβλίο είναι ένα ακαδημαϊκό κείμενο και περιλαμβάνει το έργο περίπου είκοσι εξαιρετικά δημιουργικών συγγραφέων. Συνεισφέροντας συγγραφείς στο βιβλίο περιλαμβάνουν, μεταξύ άλλων, τους Proff. Hazel Barnes (Πανεπιστήμιο του Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Πανεπιστήμιο Stellenbosch) και Yvonne Sliep από το Πανεπιστήμιο του KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Το έργο αυτό ξεκίνησε το 2009 και μου πήρε μεγάλο μέρος του χρόνου μου για να φέρω κοντά το έργο εξαιρετικά δημιουργικών συγγραφέων. Η έρευνα που μεταδίδεται μέσω του βιβλίου είναι πρωτότυπη και επίκαιρη και συμβάλλει σημαντικά στις συζητήσεις σχετικά με το ρόλο/ους και τη σημασία του δράματος στην αντιμετώπιση ζητημάτων του HIV & του AIDS», λέει ο καθηγητής Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22. A ticket to Storyworld gives you free access to the Spotlight room where you can visit The World of Lara Croft.<br/><br/>Would you like to visit the Storyworld museum and the world's largest playable game exhibition: Game On at Forum Groningen at the same day?

Από την πρώτη εμφάνιση βιντεοπαιχνιδιών της Lara Croft στο Tomb Raider (1996), τα κατορθώματά της ως περιπετειώδης και γρήγορος εξερευνητής έχουν απήχηση ευρέως στους παίκτες, κερδίζοντας της μια θέση στο πάνθεον των μεγάλων χαρακτήρων της ποπ κουλτούρας. Για το λόγο αυτό θα βάλουμε το The World of Lara Croft στο Storyworld Spotlight από τις 22 Δεκεμβρίου 2021 έως τις 6 Μαρτίου 2022.<br/><br/>Κατασκευάζοντας ένα Κροφτ<br/><br/>Η Lara Croft δημιουργήθηκε από το στούντιο Core Design, στο Ντέρμπι (ΗΒ), το 1996. Το στούντιο αναζητούσε έναν πρωταγωνιστικό χαρακτήρα για το επερχόμενο 3D παιχνίδι περιπέτειας για το PlayStation 1. Ένα παιχνίδι σε προοπτική 3ου προσώπου όπου οι παίκτες θα έβλεπαν τον κύριο χαρακτήρα σε όλη τη διάρκεια κάθε σκηνής.<br/><br/>Καθώς το παιχνίδι είχε να κάνει με το "να ιππεύει μυστηριώδεις τάφους βαθιά κάτω από πυραμίδες", ο πρωταγωνιστής θα χρειαζόταν να δείχνει περιπετειώδης, και να έχει τους εγκεφάλους για να επιβιώσει από πολύπλοκες αποστολές επιδρομών. Μετά από κάποια σκέψη, γεννήθηκε η Λάρα Κροφτ, μια νεαρή, ανώτερης τάξης και εντελώς Βρετανίδα, η οποία ήταν τόσο αινιγματική και έξυπνη όσο ήταν σκληρή και αυτοδύναμη.<br/><br/>Επιτυχία και διαμάχη<br/><br/>Το Tomb Raider (1996) ήταν μια απόμακρη επιτυχία για την Core Design, η οποία γρήγορα διπλασιάστηκε στο χτίσιμο του Tomb Raider 2 (1997) και 3 (1998). Ένα μεγάλο μέρος της επιτυχίας αποδόθηκε στην πρωταγωνίστρια των αγώνων, η οποία βρήκε θαυμαστές τόσο με άνδρες όσο και με γυναίκες παίκτες. Αυτό μπέρδεψε τους κριτικούς που μόλις είδαν τη Λάρα Κροφτ ως σεξιστική γελοιογραφία.<br/><br/>Εξερεύνησε τον κόσμο της Lara Croft στο Storyworld<br/><br/>Η έκθεση αυτή εξερευνά το επιτυχημένο franchise σε βάθος. Κοιτάζει την ιστορία των αγώνων και γιατί η πρωταγωνίστρια του αντηχεί με τόσο κόσμο. Επίσης, βουτάει στο μυστήριο του τι κάνει τα παιχνίδια Tomb Raider να τσιμπάνε, από το βαθύ παγκόσμιο κτίριο μέχρι τους έξυπνους γρίφους και τις παγίδες, και από φανταστικά σχέδια εχθρών και τεράτων μέχρι το σχεδιασμό χαρακτήρων της θρυλικής ηρωίδας.<br/><br/>Άλλωστε, τα μυστήρια υπάρχουν για να τα εξερευνήσεις, και υπάρχουν εδώ και 25 χρόνια.<br/><br/>Εισιτήρια<br/><br/>Αγοράστε τα εισιτήριά σας για το Storyworld online με ημερομηνία έναρξης και ώρα εισόδου από την Τετάρτη 22 Δεκεμβρίου.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Real Estate Λόγος της Ημέρας: Επιλογή<br/><br/>Επιλογή: Μια συμφωνία για να κρατήσει ανοικτή, για μια καθορισμένη περίοδο, μια προσφορά για την πώληση ή τη μίσθωση ακίνητης περιουσίας. Μια επιλογή μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί, για παράδειγμα, για να δώσει στον αγοραστή χρόνο για να επιλύσει ερωτήματα χρηματοδότησης, τίτλου, χωροθέτησης και σκοπιμότητας πριν δεσμευτεί ο αγοραστής να αγοράσει. Οι επιλογές χρησιμοποιούνται συχνά στη διαδικασία συναρμολόγησης γης. Η επιλογή πρέπει να υποστηρίζεται από το πραγματικό αντάλλαγμα, ξεχωριστό και ανεξάρτητο από την τιμή αγοράς του ακινήτου. Η απλή αιτιολογική σκέψη περί ανταλλάγματος από μόνη της δεν αρκεί παρά μόνο σε μια μίσθωση-επιλογή στην οποία οι διατάξεις της μίσθωσης είναι οι ίδιες επαρκείς για να υποστηρίξουν την επιλογή. Μια επιλογή απλώς δημιουργεί ένα συμβατικό δικαίωμα· δεν δίνει στον optionee κανένα ακίνητο στο ακίνητο. Κατά τη στιγμή της υπογραφής της επιλογής, ο ιδιοκτήτης δεν πωλεί, ούτε ο αγοραστής αγοράζει, το ακίνητο. Αν και ο ιδιοκτήτης είναι υποχρεωμένος να πουλήσει αν του δοθεί ειδοποίηση από τον αγοραστή, ο αγοραστής δεν είναι υποχρεωμένος να αγοράσει. Μια επιλογή αγοράς είναι επίσης γνωστή ως κλήση· μια επιλογή πώλησης είναι γνωστή ως put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Οφέλη των Καροτενοειδών για το Δέρμα<br/><br/>Έχετε ακούσει για τα καροτενοειδή; Αυτά τα ισχυρά φυτοχημικά είναι τα χρωματισμένα συστατικά που βρίσκονται στα φυτά που δίνουν λουλούδια, φρούτα και αφήνουν τα κίτρινα, πορτοκαλί και κόκκινα χρώματά τους.<br/><br/>Από τη δεκαετία του 1930, οι επιστήμονες έχουν εντοπίσει περίπου 800 καροτενοειδή και περίπου 40 βρίσκονται στο ανθρώπινο σώμα, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του εξώτερου στρώματος της επιδερμίδας, του δέρματος και του υποδόριου λίπους. Τα πιο συνηθισμένα καροτενοειδή είναι το β-καροτένιο, το α-καροτένιο, η λουτεΐνη, η ζεαξανθίνη, το λυκοπένιο και η ασταξανθίνη. Μπορείτε να διαβάσετε περισσότερα για την ασταξανθίνη εδώ.<br/><br/>Η περιεκτικότητα των καροτενοειδών στο δέρμα επηρεάζεται από πολυάριθμους παράγοντες, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της πρόσληψης φρούτων και λαχανικών, της βιοδιαθεσιμότητάς τους από διάφορα τρόφιμα, τη συμπλήρωση, την έκθεση σε υπεριώδη ακτινοβολία, την ατμοσφαιρική ρύπανση, την κατανάλωση αλκοόλ, το κάπνισμα και το άγχος.<br/><br/>Πώς βοηθούν τα καροτενοειδή το δέρμα μου;<br/><br/>Τα καροτενοειδή είναι μερικά από τα πιο γνωστά αντιοξειδωτικά για το δέρμα και έχουν επίσης σημαντικές λειτουργίες ως αντιφλεγμονώδεις παράγοντες.<br/><br/>Υγιής Γήρανση και Επισκευή Δέρματος<br/><br/>Τα αντιοξειδωτικά είναι απαραίτητα για το υγιές δέρμα επειδή βοηθούν στην πρόληψη της βλάβης των ελεύθερων ριζών στα κύτταρα. Οι ελεύθερες ρίζες προκαλούν πρόωρη γήρανση και την έναρξη διαφόρων τύπων καρκίνων του δέρματος. Τα καροτενοειδή, μαζί με τη βιταμίνη Ε, τη βιταμίνη C και το ένζυμο Co Q10 είναι σημαντικά δερματικά αντιοξειδωτικά.<br/><br/>Λόγω της αντιοξειδωτικής τους δράσης, τα καροτενοειδή υποστηρίζουν και ενθαρρύνουν την παραγωγή κολλαγόνου και ελαστίνης στο δέρμα. Αυτό βοηθά στην αύξηση της πυκνότητας, του πάχους, της ελαστικότητας και της σφριγηλότητας του δέρματος. Το κολλαγόνο και η ελαστίνη μειώνονται καθώς γερνάμε, οπότε η λήψη αρκετών καροτενοειδών στη διατροφή και τοπικά είναι κρίσιμη για τη γήρανση καλά.<br/><br/>Τα καροτενοειδή μπορούν να βελτιώσουν τα σημάδια της φωτογήρανσης, του αποχρωματισμού του δέρματος, της ελαστικότητας, της ενυδάτωσης, της υφής και μπορούν να μειώσουν την διαεπιδερμική απώλεια νερού.<br/><br/>Η ασταξανθίνη ιδιαίτερα διεγείρει τους ινοβλάστες να παράγουν κολλαγόνο και ελαστίνη, αναστέλλει τη δραστηριότητα των ενζύμων που διασπά το κολλαγόνο και την ελαστίνη, και παρουσιάζει αντιφλεγμονώδη και UV-φιλτράρισμα αποτελέσματα. Έχει αποδειχθεί ότι μειώνει τη μελανίνη στο δέρμα, με αποτέλεσμα τη μείωση της εμφάνισης φακίδων και μελάσματος.<br/><br/>Δραστηριότητα κατά της ακμής: η αντιφλεγμονώδης δράση των καροτενοειδών βοηθά στην απόσβεση της φλεγμονής και του ερεθισμού που σχετίζεται με την ακμή. Τα καροτενοειδή βοηθούν επίσης στην ομαλοποίηση και την εξισορρόπηση των εκκρίσεων λαδιού από τους σμηγματογόνους αδένες. Είναι πολύτιμοι παράγοντες στην αποκατάσταση του δέρματος και διεγείρουν την επιδερμική αναγέννηση, βοηθώντας στην εξομάλυνση και την μαλακότητα του δέρματος.<br/><br/>Πού μπορώ να βρω καροτενοειδή;<br/><br/>Υπάρχουν δύο τρόποι για να πάρετε την καθημερινή δόση των καροτενοειδών σας: μέσω της διατροφής και μέσω της τοπικής εφαρμογής. Ο συνδυασμός και των δύο είναι η ιδανική προσέγγιση για την καλή γήρανση του δέρματος.<br/><br/>Τα καροτενοειδή είναι λιποδιαλυτά, οπότε το σώμα σας χρειάζεται λίπος για να τα απορροφήσει (σκεφτείτε ντομάτες και ελαιόλαδο, μπρόκολο και βούτυρο, ή σπανάκι και αβοκάντο). Κοινές πηγές καροτενοειδών στα τρόφιμα είναι το αβοκάντο, οι κρόκοι αυγών, το λάχανο, το σπανάκι, τα καρότα, οι γλυκοπατάτες, η παπάγια και οι ντομάτες.<br/><br/>Ενώ συνηγορούμε στο να πάρετε όσα περισσότερα θρεπτικά συστατικά και αντιοξειδωτικά μπορείτε από τα τρόφιμα και όχι από τα συμπληρώματα. μια μελέτη έδειξε ότι η ασταξανθίνη σε συνδυασμό με το υδρολυμένο κολλαγόνο βελτίωσαν σημαντικά την ακεραιότητα του φραγμού, μείωσαν την διαεπιδερμική απώλεια νερού και αύξησαν την έκφραση του προκολλαγόνου τύπου I mRNA.<br/><br/>Μελέτες δείχνουν ότι οι υψηλές συγκεντρώσεις των αντιοξειδωτικών στο ανθρώπινο δέρμα προσφέρουν την καλύτερη προστασία για το υγιές δέρμα σε οποιαδήποτε ηλικία.<br/><br/>Στη Βοτανική Σάρκα, αναμειγνύουμε καροτενοειδή πλούσια, ολόκληρα φυτά όπως καλέντουλα, πικραλίδα, και εκχυλίσματα όπως η ασταξανθίνη με έλαια ψυχρής πίεσης και λειτουργικά συστατικά. Η καλέντουλα από μόνη της περιέχει πάνω από 19 διαφορετικούς τύπους καροτενοειδών. Αυτό μπορεί να εξηγήσει γιατί έχει τόσο μεγάλο ιστορικό χρήσης στη φροντίδα του δέρματος. Μελέτες δείχνουν ότι τα καροτενοειδή που αναμειγνύονται με το συνένζυμο Q10 είναι ιδιαίτερα αποτελεσματικά στη μείωση της φλεγμονής και την επιβράδυνση της πρόωρης γήρανσης του δέρματος λόγω της έκθεσης στον ήλιο. |
