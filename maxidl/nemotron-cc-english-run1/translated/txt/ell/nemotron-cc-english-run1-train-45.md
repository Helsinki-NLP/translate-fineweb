| Political Selling 101<br/><br/>Written by Dave Stein<br/><br/>Note: To see charts in this article, view it on  Most people who have been selling for even a short period of time understand that some level of corporate politics is present in every organization into which they sell. As sales professionals' experience and political savvy increases, so does what they observe in their accounts. If you aren't aware of political activity in your accounts, it doesn't mean that it isn't there. It just means you can't see it and certainly can't leverage it. If your competitor is politically savvy, you are at a distinct disadvantage. What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster one definition is, "competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership." Winners have developed a set of skills that enables them to consistently succeed because of, or in spite of, politics. They've learned to select right competing interest groups and then ride power and leadership wave to success by devising and executing political strategies for each key influencer and decision maker. Being adept politically will rarely lead to a win by itself. There are many other components to winning. But to not understand and take advantage of interpersonal forces within an account is to leave assets unleveraged. Here are some of key skills required to elevate yourself into realm of political selling: Skill: A basic understanding of how corporate politics works. For our purposes, politics and influence are synonymous. People need help of other people to achieve certain business goals (i.e. my department's project gets funded) as well as business-driven personal goals (i.e. if it is successful, I get a raise--I can afford that new house). Within a company, it works something like this: "If you report to me I can just tell you to do something and you will do it." That's SAY-SO influence. You'll do it because I say so. But if you don't work for me--let's say you work in another department--it becomes more difficult. I then have to influence you to help me. I'll use POLITICAL influence. That requires a combination of skills and artistry and it takes time and strategy. Here is an example: Let's say that we both work for same company, but for different departments. If I need your help for my department to achieve its quarterly objectives, I might look for ways in which I can help you achieve your objectives (ideally, business and personal objectives) and subtly advertise those to you as benefits of helping me. In that way we are aligned with a set of common interdependent purposes. Win-win. When you are selling into a company, you have absolutely no SAY-SO over buyer. You can't tell anyone in your customer's company what to do. You can only influence them to give you information, insights, coaching and preference so that they influence others to look at you and your offering favorably. The best way to influence someone is to clearly communicate how and by how much you will contribute to advancement of their business and (business-related) personal goals. In diagram below, you'll see that when you can help a buyer or influencer meet their personal and business goals (Quadrant 1), you're much more likely to gain commitment from them in helping you win. In Quadrant 2, there is no personal win, so their commitment, although altruistic so far as a contribution to their company, will not be supported as strongly. Stay away from people in Quadrant 3. In those cases, person you are selling to is "in it for themselves," acting counter to what is in best interests of their company. You run risk of not only losing deal, but being associated with "dirty politics," which could affect your personal and your company's reputation. Quadrant 4 reminds you that if you find you can't contribute to person achieving their business or personal goals, your likelihood of gaining their support is minimal. Don't turn these people into enemies, but focus your efforts on finding and selling to influencers in first quadrant. Skill: The ability to see what's invisible As I suggested earlier, not everyone is skilled enough to observe sophisticated corporate politicians being influential. Savvy politicians do their thing privately. It's not unlike backroom deals done by government politicians. How do you know that there is influence being wielded? First, assume it is. Then begin to look at results and work backward. We can extract a good example from everyday government politics: If there is "pork"--say $650.3 million in corporate tax benefits for igloo manufacturers in Alaska--embedded in a House of Representatives education bill, you can quickly figure out who lent a hand getting it through committee. Ask your contacts within your customer's company or government department about prior purchases, projects and initiatives. Find out who sponsored them, whose budgets paid for them, who were ultimate decision makers and who benefited in some more personal ways. The names you come up with will likely be people of influence, either through their command of an organization, or through astute politicking. They are ones for whose influence you will be positioning during your sales campaign. Skill: Connecting dots You've done some discovery and have begun to make associations. When you asked about recent projects, several people referenced Carrie Miehome, who works in IT organization. She deftly led steering committee with CRM project last year. Funny thing though, that project was put ahead of others that already had funding. Why would that be, you might ask? Who benefits from a CRM implementation? The VP of Sales? The VP of Customer Service? Perhaps CFO who wants more visibility into revenue stream... It's perfectly reasonable to expect that she was influenced by a higher power. The challenge will be finding out whom, what was in it for them and what was in it for her if you are selling IT solutions to that company. Skill: Knowing how to map out organization You'll need to start with an organization chart. If they won't give you one, you can build one by getting answers to pointed questions about reporting structure, by reading information on web and, if your customer is a public company, from corporate SEC filings.<br/><br/>Why Write a Sales Letter for Each Product?<br/><br/>Authors/publishers are great at getting their books written. Entrepreneurs know their products. But after initial one-year honeymoon, sales slow down. To counter this make sure your ebook, product, or service you offer will keep on selling from first day, first year, even for life. Write a short sales letter for each product or ebook.<br/><br/>Whether you have a Web site or not, you can write a first class, must-buy-now sales letter. Write one for each teleclass, eBook, product, or service. I even write one for my bookcoaching services.<br/><br/>If you are like me and have a Web site, it is content driven. Why? Because that's why people come to any site--to get free information. You must also give them a reason to buy. Most home pages say too much about author or book instead of intriguing their potential buyers with a benefit- driven headline, which in turns leads them to benefits of their books--the sales letter.<br/><br/>My first Web site had many fine books and kits in personal growth and book writing and marketing. Sales never went over $200 a month. To correct that, I created a new site and paid special attention to its sales language (without hype) for each teleclass, eBook, and book coaching opportunities to suit each income and need. Sales were $75 first month, and in four months they reached $2265. The next year they went around $3000 a month.<br/><br/>What Every Sales Letter Needs to Pull Orders and Profits<br/><br/>You can write each sales letter in less than four hours first time. As you practice, you can write them in two hours.<br/><br/>1. Start Letter with a Benefit-Driven Headline.<br/><br/>Include these headlines throughout your sales letter. "Want a quick and easy way to quadruple your Online Income in Four Months?<br/><br/>If you answered, "yes" to yourself, headline succeeds, because you will keep reading. If you said "No, I don't believe this, " but I'm curious where this is going," headline still succeeds. You win when your headline seduces your potential customer to read on in your sales letter to discover your product[']s benefits and features, some fine testimonials, and finally to click "buy now" which takes them to order page.<br/><br/>2. List Top Five Benefits of your Product or Service in bullet form.<br/><br/>To define your top benefits start with a list of problems your client or customer wants solutions for. Each specific problem you answer can be labeled a benefit. If you are not rock sure of who your audience is, your sales copy dribbles away and doesn't meet its target. Keep redefining your audience and know as much about them as you can.<br/><br/>Remember that one benefit is top undeniable benefit—usually more money easier, more clients faster, more profits from Web sales, better relationships, and health.<br/><br/>If you have more than five benefits collected in a list, sprinkle rest throughout your copy. How will your book make someone's life easier, richer in time or money, help their personal growth, provide additional income, entertain them? How will your product or service make them a better business person, more attractive, feel better, avoid catastrophe, sickness, or surgery?<br/><br/>3. Address your Potential Buyer's Resistances.<br/><br/>Remember to tell a background story of where they are NOW so they will emotionally connect with your solutions (the product or service). Let's say they want to write an eBook or print book to make themselves "expert," make life-long passive income, or share their unique message. | Πολιτική Πώληση 101<br/><br/>Συγγραφέας: Dave Stein<br/><br/>Σημείωση: Για να δείτε διαγράμματα σε αυτό το άρθρο, δείτε το στο Οι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι που έχουν πουλήσει για ακόμη και ένα σύντομο χρονικό διάστημα κατανοούν ότι κάποιο επίπεδο εταιρικής πολιτικής είναι παρόν σε κάθε οργανισμό στον οποίο πωλούν. Καθώς η εμπειρία των επαγγελματιών πωλήσεων και η πολιτική γνώση αυξάνεται, το ίδιο κάνει και αυτό που παρατηρούν στους λογαριασμούς τους. Αν δεν γνωρίζετε την πολιτική δραστηριότητα στους λογαριασμούς σας, αυτό δεν σημαίνει ότι δεν υπάρχει. Σημαίνει απλά ότι δεν μπορείς να το δεις και σίγουρα δεν μπορείς να το εκμεταλλευτείς. Αν ο ανταγωνιστής σου είναι πολιτικά γνώστης, βρίσκεσαι σε ένα ξεχωριστό μειονέκτημα. Τι είναι η πολιτική; Σύμφωνα με τον Merriam-Webster ένας ορισμός είναι, «ανταγωνισμός μεταξύ ανταγωνιστικών ομάδων συμφερόντων ή ατόμων για την εξουσία και την ηγεσία». Οι νικητές έχουν αναπτύξει ένα σύνολο δεξιοτήτων που τους δίνει τη δυνατότητα να πετυχαίνουν με συνέπεια λόγω, ή παρά την, πολιτική. Έχουν μάθει να επιλέγουν σωστές ανταγωνιστικές ομάδες συμφερόντων και στη συνέχεια να οδηγούν την εξουσία και το ηγετικό κύμα στην επιτυχία επινοώντας και εκτελώντας πολιτικές στρατηγικές για κάθε βασικό επηρεαστή και υπεύθυνο λήψης αποφάσεων. Το να είναι κανείς έμπειρος πολιτικά σπάνια θα οδηγήσει σε μια νίκη από μόνος του. Υπάρχουν πολλά άλλα συστατικά για να κερδίσει. Αλλά το να μην καταλαβαίνει και να εκμεταλλεύεται τις διαπροσωπικές δυνάμεις μέσα σε ένα λογαριασμό είναι να αφήνει τα περιουσιακά στοιχεία άμισθα. Ακολουθούν μερικές από τις βασικές δεξιότητες που απαιτούνται για να ανυψώσετε τον εαυτό σας σε σφαίρα πολιτικών πωλήσεων: Επιδεξιότητα: Μια βασική κατανόηση του τρόπου λειτουργίας της εταιρικής πολιτικής. Για τους σκοπούς μας, η πολιτική και η επιρροή είναι συνώνυμες. Οι άνθρωποι χρειάζονται βοήθεια από άλλους ανθρώπους για να επιτύχουν ορισμένους επιχειρηματικούς στόχους (δηλαδή το έργο του τμήματος μου χρηματοδοτείται) καθώς και προσωπικούς στόχους που καθοδηγούνται από τις επιχειρήσεις (δηλαδή αν είναι επιτυχής, παίρνω αύξηση - μπορώ να αντέξω οικονομικά αυτό το νέο σπίτι). Μέσα σε μια εταιρεία, λειτουργεί κάτι σαν αυτό: "Αν μου αναφέρεις μπορώ απλά να σου πω να κάνεις κάτι και θα το κάνεις." Αυτό είναι επιρροή SAY-SO. Θα το κάνεις επειδή το λέω εγώ. Αλλά αν δεν δουλεύεις για μένα -ας πούμε ότι δουλεύεις σε άλλο τμήμα- γίνεται πιο δύσκολο. Τότε πρέπει να σε επηρεάσω για να με βοηθήσεις. Θα χρησιμοποιήσω την πολιτική επιρροή. Αυτό απαιτεί συνδυασμό δεξιοτήτων και καλλιτεχνίας και χρειάζεται χρόνο και στρατηγική. Ακολουθεί ένα παράδειγμα: Ας πούμε ότι και οι δύο δουλεύουμε για την ίδια εταιρεία, αλλά για διαφορετικά τμήματα. Αν χρειαστώ τη βοήθειά σας για να επιτύχει το τμήμα μου τους τριμηνιαίους στόχους του, μπορεί να αναζητήσω τρόπους με τους οποίους μπορώ να σας βοηθήσω να πετύχετε τους στόχους σας (ιδανικά, επιχειρηματικούς και προσωπικούς στόχους) και να διαφημίσετε διακριτικά αυτούς σε εσάς ως οφέλη της βοήθειάς μου. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο ευθυγραμμιζόμαστε με ένα σύνολο κοινών αλληλοεξαρτώμενων σκοπών. Win-win. Όταν πουλάτε σε μια εταιρεία, δεν έχετε απολύτως καμία SAY-SO έναντι του αγοραστή. Δεν μπορείτε να πείτε σε κανέναν στην εταιρεία του πελάτη σας τι να κάνει. Μπορείτε να τους επηρεάσετε μόνο για να σας δώσουν πληροφορίες, ενόραση, καθοδήγηση και προτίμηση, ώστε να επηρεάσουν τους άλλους να σας κοιτάξουν και να σας προσφέρουν ευνοϊκά. Ο καλύτερος τρόπος για να επηρεάσετε κάποιον είναι να επικοινωνείτε με σαφήνεια πώς και με πόσο θα συμβάλλετε στην πρόοδο των επιχειρηματικών και (σχετικών με τις επιχειρήσεις) προσωπικών στόχων του. Στο παρακάτω διάγραμμα, θα δείτε ότι όταν μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε έναν αγοραστή ή έναν επηρεαστή να εκπληρώσει τους προσωπικούς και επιχειρηματικούς του στόχους (Quadrant 1), είναι πολύ πιο πιθανό να κερδίσετε δέσμευση από αυτούς βοηθώντας σας να κερδίσετε. Στο Τεταρτημόριο 2, δεν υπάρχει προσωπική νίκη, έτσι η δέσμευσή τους, αν και αλτρουιστική μέχρι στιγμής ως συμβολή στην εταιρεία τους, δεν θα υποστηριχθεί τόσο έντονα. Μείνετε μακριά από τους ανθρώπους στο Τεταρτημόριο 3. Σε αυτές τις περιπτώσεις, το άτομο στο οποίο πουλάτε είναι "σε αυτό για τον εαυτό τους", ενεργώντας αντίθετα με το τι είναι προς το καλύτερο συμφέρον της εταιρείας τους. Διατρέχετε τον κίνδυνο όχι μόνο να χάσετε τη συμφωνία, αλλά να συσχετιστείτε με τη "βρώμικη πολιτική", η οποία θα μπορούσε να επηρεάσει την προσωπική σας και τη φήμη της εταιρείας σας. Το τεταρτημόριο 4 σας υπενθυμίζει ότι αν βρείτε ότι δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε στην επίτευξη των επιχειρηματικών ή προσωπικών στόχων τους, οι πιθανότητές σας να κερδίσετε την υποστήριξή τους είναι ελάχιστες. Μην μετατρέπετε αυτούς τους ανθρώπους σε εχθρούς, αλλά επικεντρώστε τις προσπάθειές σας στην εύρεση και την πώληση σε επηρεαστές στο πρώτο τεταρτημόριο. Επιδεξιότητα: Η ικανότητα να βλέπεις αυτό που είναι αόρατο όπως πρότεινα νωρίτερα, δεν είναι όλοι ικανοί να παρατηρήσουν εκλεπτυσμένους εταιρικούς πολιτικούς να ασκούν επιρροή. Δεν είναι σε αντίθεση με τις συμφωνίες στα παρασκήνια που γίνονται από τους κυβερνητικούς πολιτικούς. Πώς ξέρετε ότι υπάρχει επιρροή που ασκείται; Πρώτα, υποθέστε ότι είναι. Στη συνέχεια, αρχίστε να κοιτάτε τα αποτελέσματα και να δουλεύετε προς τα πίσω. Μπορούμε να αποσπάσουμε ένα καλό παράδειγμα από την καθημερινή κυβερνητική πολιτική: Αν υπάρχει "χόρτο" - ας πούμε 650,3 εκατομμύρια δολάρια σε εταιρικά φορολογικά οφέλη για τους κατασκευαστές igloo στην Αλάσκα - ενσωματωμένο σε ένα νομοσχέδιο εκπαίδευσης της Βουλής των Αντιπροσώπων, μπορείτε γρήγορα να βρείτε ποιος δάνεισε ένα χέρι για να το πάρει μέσω επιτροπής. Ρωτήστε τις επαφές σας μέσα στην εταιρεία ή το κυβερνητικό τμήμα του πελάτη σας σχετικά με προηγούμενες αγορές, έργα και πρωτοβουλίες. Μάθετε ποιος τους χρηματοδότησε, των οποίων οι προϋπολογισμοί τους πλήρωσαν, ποιοι ήταν οι απόλυτοι υπεύθυνοι λήψης αποφάσεων και ποιοι επωφελήθηκαν με κάποιους πιο προσωπικούς τρόπους. Τα ονόματα που θα βρείτε πιθανότατα θα είναι άνθρωποι επιρροής, είτε μέσω της διοίκησης ενός οργανισμού, είτε μέσω της έξυπνης πολιτικοποίησης. Επιδεξιότητα: Συνδέοντας τελείες Έχετε κάνει κάποια ανακάλυψη και έχετε αρχίσει να κάνετε συσχετίσεις. Όταν ρωτήσατε για πρόσφατα έργα, αρκετοί άνθρωποι έκαναν αναφορά στην Κάρι Μίχομ, η οποία εργάζεται στον οργανισμό πληροφορικής. Ηγήθηκε επιδέξια της επιτροπής διεύθυνσης με το έργο CRM πέρυσι. Αστείο όμως, το έργο αυτό τέθηκε μπροστά από άλλα που είχαν ήδη χρηματοδότηση. Γιατί να είναι αυτό, θα μπορούσατε να ρωτήσετε; Ποιος επωφελείται από μια υλοποίηση CRM; Ο VP των Πωλήσεων; Ο αντιπρόεδρος της Εξυπηρέτησης Πελατών; Ίσως ο CFO που θέλει περισσότερη προβολή στην ροή των εσόδων... είναι απολύτως λογικό να περιμένει ότι επηρεάστηκε από μια ανώτερη δύναμη. Η πρόκληση θα είναι να βρείτε ποιος, τι ήταν σε αυτό γι 'αυτούς και τι ήταν σε αυτό γι 'αυτήν αν πουλάτε λύσεις πληροφορικής σε εκείνη την εταιρεία. Επιδεξιότητα: Γνωρίζοντας πώς να χαρτογραφήσετε την οργάνωση Θα πρέπει να ξεκινήσετε με ένα οργανόγραμμα. Αν δεν σας δώσουν, μπορείτε να κατασκευάσετε ένα, παίρνοντας απαντήσεις σε αιχμηρές ερωτήσεις σχετικά με τη δομή αναφορών, διαβάζοντας πληροφορίες στον ιστό και, αν ο πελάτης σας είναι μια δημόσια εταιρεία, από εταιρικές αρχειοθετήσεις SEC.<br/><br/>Γιατί να Γράψετε μια Επιστολή Πωλήσεων για Κάθε Προϊόν;<br/><br/>Οι συγγραφείς/εκδότες είναι σπουδαίοι στο να γράφουν τα βιβλία τους. Οι επιχειρηματίες γνωρίζουν τα προϊόντα τους. Αλλά μετά τον αρχικό μήνα του μέλιτος ενός έτους, οι πωλήσεις επιβραδύνονται. Για να αντισταθμιστεί αυτό, βεβαιωθείτε ότι το ebook, το προϊόν ή η υπηρεσία που προσφέρετε θα συνεχίσει να πουλά από την πρώτη ημέρα, το πρώτο έτος, ακόμα και ισόβια. Γράψτε μια σύντομη επιστολή πωλήσεων για κάθε προϊόν ή ebook.<br/><br/>Είτε έχετε μια ιστοσελίδα είτε όχι, μπορείτε να γράψετε μια πρώτη θέση, must-buy-now επιστολή πωλήσεων. Γράψτε ένα για κάθε teleclass, eBook, προϊόν, ή υπηρεσία. Ακόμα γράφω ένα για τις υπηρεσίες μου bookcoaching.<br/><br/>Αν είστε σαν εμένα και έχετε μια ιστοσελίδα, αυτό οδηγείται από το περιεχόμενο. Γιατί; Επειδή γι 'αυτό οι άνθρωποι έρχονται σε οποιαδήποτε ιστοσελίδα - για να πάρουν δωρεάν πληροφορίες. Πρέπει επίσης να τους δώσετε έναν λόγο για να αγοράσουν. Οι περισσότερες αρχικές σελίδες λένε πάρα πολλά για το συγγραφέα ή το βιβλίο αντί να διεγείρουν τους πιθανούς αγοραστές τους με μια επικεφαλίδα με γνώμονα το όφελος, η οποία με τη σειρά της τους οδηγεί σε οφέλη από τα βιβλία τους - την επιστολή πώλησης.<br/><br/>Η πρώτη μου ιστοσελίδα είχε πολλά ωραία βιβλία και κιτ σε προσωπική ανάπτυξη και συγγραφή βιβλίων και μάρκετινγκ. Οι πωλήσεις ποτέ δεν ξεπερνούσαν τα 200 δολάρια το μήνα. Για να το διορθώσω αυτό, δημιούργησα ένα νέο site και έδωσα ιδιαίτερη προσοχή στη γλώσσα πωλήσεών του (χωρίς διαφημιστική εκστρατεία) για κάθε teleclass, eBook, και ευκαιρίες προπονητικής βιβλίων για να ταιριάζουν σε κάθε εισόδημα και ανάγκη. Οι πωλήσεις ήταν $75 τον πρώτο μήνα, και σε τέσσερις μήνες έφτασαν τα $2265. Την επόμενη χρονιά πήγαιναν γύρω στα 3.000 δολάρια το μήνα.<br/><br/>Τι Χρειάζεται Κάθε Επιστολή Πωλήσεων για να Τραβάει Εντολές και Κέρδη<br/><br/>Μπορείτε να γράψετε κάθε γράμμα πωλήσεων σε λιγότερο από τέσσερις ώρες την πρώτη φορά. καθώς εξασκείστε, μπορείτε να τα γράψετε σε δύο ώρες.<br/><br/>1.Έναρξη Επιστολής με Κεφαλίδα Οφέλη.<br/><br/>Συμπεριλάβετε αυτές τις επικεφαλίδες σε όλη την επιστολή πωλήσεών σας. "Θέλετε έναν γρήγορο και εύκολο τρόπο να τετραπλασιάσετε το ηλεκτρονικό εισόδημά σας σε τέσσερις μήνες;<br/><br/>Αν απαντούσες, "ναι" στον εαυτό σου, η επικεφαλίδα πετυχαίνει, γιατί θα συνεχίσεις να διαβάζεις. Αν έλεγες "Όχι, δεν το πιστεύω αυτό, "αλλά είμαι περίεργος που πηγαίνει αυτό", η επικεφαλίδα εξακολουθεί να πετυχαίνει. Κερδίζετε όταν η επικεφαλίδα σας σαγηνεύει τον πιθανό πελάτη σας για να διαβάσετε στην επιστολή πωλήσεών σας για να ανακαλύψετε τα οφέλη και τα χαρακτηριστικά του προϊόντος σας, μερικές εκλεκτές μαρτυρίες, και τέλος για να κάνετε κλικ στο "buy now" που τους πηγαίνει στη σελίδα παραγγελιών.<br/><br/>2. Κατάλογος Top Five Οφέλη του προϊόντος ή της υπηρεσίας σας σε μορφή σφαίρας.<br/><br/>Για να ορίσετε τα κορυφαία οφέλη σας ξεκινήστε με μια λίστα προβλημάτων για τα οποία ο πελάτης ή ο πελάτης σας θέλει λύσεις. Για κάθε συγκεκριμένο πρόβλημα που απαντάτε μπορεί να επισημανθεί ένα όφελος. Αν δεν είσαι σίγουρος για το ποιο είναι το κοινό σου, το αντίγραφο των πωλήσεων σου απομακρύνεται και δεν πετυχαίνει τον στόχο του. Συνέχισε να επαναπροσδιορίζεις το κοινό σου και να ξέρεις όσα περισσότερα μπορείς γι' αυτούς.<br/><br/>Να θυμάστε ότι ένα όφελος είναι το κορυφαίο αναμφισβήτητο όφελος - συνήθως περισσότερα χρήματα ευκολότερα, περισσότεροι πελάτες γρηγορότερα, περισσότερα κέρδη από τις πωλήσεις στο Web, καλύτερες σχέσεις και υγεία.<br/><br/>Πώς το βιβλίο σας θα κάνει τη ζωή κάποιου ευκολότερη, πλουσιότερη σε χρόνο ή χρήμα, θα βοηθήσει την προσωπική του ανάπτυξη, θα παρέχει επιπλέον εισόδημα, θα τους διασκεδάζει; Πώς θα τους κάνει το προϊόν ή η υπηρεσία σας ένα καλύτερο επιχειρηματικό πρόσωπο, πιο ελκυστικό, να αισθάνεται καλύτερα, να αποφεύγει την καταστροφή, την ασθένεια ή τη χειρουργική επέμβαση;<br/><br/>3. Απευθυνθείτε στις αντιστάσεις του πιθανού αγοραστή σας.<br/><br/>Θυμηθείτε να πείτε μια ιστορία για το πού βρίσκονται τώρα, ώστε να συνδεθούν συναισθηματικά με τις λύσεις σας (το προϊόν ή την υπηρεσία). Ας πούμε ότι θέλουν να γράψουν ένα eBook ή να τυπώσουν βιβλίο για να γίνουν "ειδικοί", να κάνουν ισόβια παθητικό εισόδημα, ή να μοιραστούν το μοναδικό τους μήνυμα. |

We believe, teach and practice all things that Jesus taught and were practiced by the Church in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Jesus called his disciples to be salt and light. Salt is a preservative but it is also something that adds savor and enjoyment to our daily food. Light is a symbol of truth; it is comforting, penetrating, guiding and exposes darkness. We seek to preserve biblical truth and shed the glorious light of the Gospel in a world that is consumed by darkness.<br/><br/>Watch the webcast eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ABOUT THE VIDEO<br/><br/>God has given progressive revelations throughout the Bible and it is with this knowledge that we can deduce there was a creation prior to Adam. We don't know how long it lasted but Lucifer was an angel who led a rebellion in heaven and started a war that affected the entire universe. The earth was his planet and he ruled from Eden, the same place where God would later put Adam and Eve. As Lucifer's last stand, the earth would have been damaged and looked much like Berlin did at the end of World War II. This would explain why the Bible speaks about a re-creation and God's call to replenish the earth. Adam and Eve were thrown into the conflict to prove that God is righteous to the angelic world. The rewards are potentially enormous: eternal life and being joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>If there was indeed a pre-Adamic civilization with commerce and war, then you shouldn't be surprised when a new world order emerges in the future that calls for peace and offers membership to anyone who will take an oath of loyalty and receive an identification mark that will give you access to the new financial system.

Roots Of Evolution With Paul James-Griffiths Did the theory of evolution start with Charles Darwin? If not, whose work was he building on, and from where did they get their influences? Paul James-Griffiths is a former ancient history teacher in this talk he presents his research on the origin of the theory of evolution one of the most hopeless moments of her life Erna de Vries clutches at this straw of hope: 'to see the sun again'. A prisoner in the infamous 'Death Block 25' of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the 19-year-old German Jew and her fellow inmates are about to be gassed that very morning. However, she escapes this cruel fate. A so-called 'Mischling' -- a half-Jew -- she is seized from the death block and sent to Ravensbrueck by a special transport for 'Mischlinge'. At Ravensbrueck, a women's concentration camp, Erna de Vries is put into forced labor for the German company Siemens. In May 1945 while on the infamous 'death march' Erna de Vries is finally liberated by US troops.<br/><br/>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.<br/><br/>Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.<br/><br/>The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.<br/><br/>The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.<br/><br/>The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.<br/><br/>The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.<br/><br/>Psalm 121 Peter, the Apostle<br/><br/>"When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold" -Job<br/><br/>"I."

Είμαστε μια ομάδα πιστών με κέντρο την Αγία Γραφή που επιθυμούν να αναπτυχθούν με πλήρη γνώση του Ιησού Χριστού χωρίς συμβιβασμούς στο Λόγο Του. Πιστεύουμε, διδάσκουμε και ασκούμε όλα τα πράγματα που δίδαξε ο Ιησούς και ασκήθηκαν από την Εκκλησία στο βιβλίο των Πράξεων των Αποστόλων. Το αλάτι είναι συντηρητικό αλλά είναι και κάτι που προσθέτει γεύση και απόλαυση στην καθημερινή μας τροφή. Το φως είναι σύμβολο της αλήθειας· είναι παρηγορητικό, διεισδυτικό, καθοδηγητικό και εκθέτει το σκοτάδι. Επιδιώκουμε να διατηρήσουμε τη βιβλική αλήθεια και να ρίξουμε το ένδοξο φως του Ευαγγελίου σε έναν κόσμο που καταναλώνεται από το σκοτάδι.<br/><br/>Παρακολουθήστε το webcast eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ΓΙΑ ΤΟ ΒΙΝΤΕΟ<br/><br/>Ο Θεός έχει δώσει προοδευτικές αποκαλύψεις σε όλη την Αγία Γραφή και με αυτή τη γνώση μπορούμε να συμπεράνουμε ότι υπήρχε μια δημιουργία πριν από τον Αδάμ. Δεν ξέρουμε πόσο κράτησε αλλά ο Εωσφόρος ήταν ένας άγγελος που οδήγησε μια εξέγερση στον ουρανό και ξεκίνησε έναν πόλεμο που επηρέασε ολόκληρο το σύμπαν. Η γη ήταν ο πλανήτης του και κυβέρνησε από την Εδέμ, το ίδιο μέρος όπου ο Θεός θα έβαζε αργότερα τον Αδάμ και την Εύα. Ως τελευταία στάση του Εωσφόρου, η γη θα είχε καταστραφεί και θα έμοιαζε πολύ με το Βερολίνο στο τέλος του Β' Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου. Αυτό θα εξηγούσε γιατί η Αγία Γραφή μιλάει για μια αναδημιουργία και το κάλεσμα του Θεού για την αναπλήρωση της γης. Ο Αδάμ και η Εύα ρίχτηκαν στη σύγκρουση για να αποδείξουν ότι ο Θεός είναι δίκαιος στον αγγελικό κόσμο.<br/><br/>Αν πράγματι υπήρχε ένας προ-Αδαμικός πολιτισμός με εμπόριο και πόλεμο, τότε δεν πρέπει να εκπλαγείς όταν μια νέα παγκόσμια τάξη αναδύεται στο μέλλον που απαιτεί ειρήνη και προσφέρει ένταξη σε όποιον θα δώσει όρκο πίστης και θα λάβει ένα αναγνωριστικό σήμα που θα σου δώσει πρόσβαση στο νέο χρηματοπιστωτικό σύστημα.

| Post oak leaves have distinctive cross shape<br/><br/>So said the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray, on page 451 in his encyclopedic "Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology," a book published in 1872.<br/><br/>I got my copy at an old bookstore several years ago. I can't remember where exactly. The book is some 700 pages long, not including a series of gorgeous line drawings of sedges, grasses and ferns in the back. The pages feature fore edge marbling…a bit faded now… and the front and back covers are ornamented, with the monogram of the publishing house. They don't make books like this anymore.<br/><br/>Professor Gray was, of course, referring to what we have as this week's Mystery Plant, the post oak, Quercus stellata. I'm pretty confident that all you botanists out there will recognize this instantly as some sort of oak.<br/><br/>Post oak leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces.(Photo: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Oaks belong to the genus Quercus…and they are not always large trees. Some species, of course, are called "scrub oaks", which seems to me a bit of a botanical "put-down", and other species are good examples of shrubs, not more than about knee-high.<br/><br/>Here in the Southeast, we have about 45 native oak species, most of which can rather easily be differentiated into two groups: "White oaks" (including our Mystery Plant) have rounded lobes, without any points or bristles on the tips.<br/><br/>"Red oaks" feature sharply pointed lobes, each with a prominent bristle at the top. There are some other differences, too.<br/><br/>Post oak is widely distributed in the eastern USA, from southern New England through Missouri and Texas, and then east from there, including northern Florida. It is a deciduous species, producing pale, somewhat shreddy or scaly bark. Really large, old individuals can be over 60 feet tall, and because of this, they make great shade trees along city streets and in parks.<br/><br/>The acorns take one season to mature, and they are a valuable wildlife food source. What most people remember about this species are the leaves. The leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces. Generally, the leaves have a distinctive cross-shaped ("cruciform") look, with two major lobes projected more or less horizontally from the midrib.<br/><br/>The cross-shape is not always well-developed from individual to individual, however, especially is there has been any hybridization going on. (Oak species are famous for mixing it up with each other.)<br/><br/>And this is interesting: Professor Gray refers to this oak in his book by using an incorrect name. The correct and first valid name came about in 1787, penned by a German botanist named Friedrich von Wangenheim. But for some reason, Gray printed the name Quercus obtusiloba, which had been proposed by the French botanist, Andre Michaux. But Michaux was 15 years late — je regrette.<br/><br/>John Nelson is the curator of the A. C.

Οι σελίδες παρουσιάζουν το μπροστινό άκρο marbling... λίγο ξεθωριασμένο τώρα... και τα μπροστινά και πίσω εξώφυλλα είναι στολισμένα, με το μονόγραμμα του εκδοτικού οίκου.<br/><br/>Ο καθηγητής Γκρέι αναφερόταν, φυσικά, σ' αυτό που έχουμε ως το Μυστηριώδες Φυτό αυτής της εβδομάδας, την μετά βελανιδιά, Quercus stellata. Είμαι αρκετά σίγουρος ότι όλοι εσείς οι βοτανολόγοι εκεί έξω θα το αναγνωρίσετε αμέσως αυτό ως κάποιο είδος βελανιδιάς.<br/><br/>Τα φύλλα μετα βελανιδιάς είναι φωτεινά πράσινα, και γδαρσίματα στις επιφάνειες.(Φωτογραφία: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Οι βελανιδιές ανήκουν στο γένος Quercus...και δεν είναι πάντα μεγάλα δέντρα. Μερικά είδη, φυσικά, ονομάζονται "δρυς scrub", το οποίο μου φαίνεται λίγο βοτανικό "put-down", και άλλα είδη είναι καλά παραδείγματα θάμνων, όχι περισσότερο από περίπου γόνατο-υψηλό.<br/><br/>Εδώ στα νοτιοανατολικά, έχουμε περίπου 45 ενδημικά είδη βελανιδιάς, τα περισσότερα από τα οποία μπορούν μάλλον εύκολα να διαφοροποιηθούν σε δύο ομάδες: Οι "Λευκές βελανιδιές" (συμπεριλαμβανομένου του Μυστηριώδους Φυτού μας) έχουν στρογγυλεμένους λοβούς, χωρίς σημεία ή τρίχες στις άκρες.<br/><br/>Οι "Κόκκινες βελανιδιές" διαθέτουν αιχμηρά μυτερούς λοβούς, ο καθένας με μια εξέχουσα τρίχα στην κορυφή.<br/><br/>Η μεταδρυά είναι ευρέως κατανεμημένη στις ανατολικές ΗΠΑ, από τη νότια Νέα Αγγλία μέσω του Μιζούρι και του Τέξας, και στη συνέχεια ανατολικά από εκεί, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της βόρειας Φλόριντα. Είναι φυλλοβόλο είδος, που παράγει ωχρό, κάπως τεμαχισμένο ή φολιδωτό φλοιό. Πραγματικά μεγάλα, παλιά άτομα μπορούν να έχουν ύψος πάνω από 60 πόδια, και εξαιτίας αυτού, φτιάχνουν μεγάλα δέντρα σκιάς κατά μήκος των δρόμων της πόλης και σε πάρκα.<br/><br/>Τα βελανίδια χρειάζονται μια εποχή για να ωριμάσουν, και αποτελούν πολύτιμη πηγή τροφής για την άγρια ζωή. Αυτό που οι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι θυμούνται σχετικά με αυτό το είδος είναι τα φύλλα. Τα φύλλα είναι φωτεινά πράσινα, και γρατζουνισμένα στις επιφάνειες. Γενικά, τα φύλλα έχουν ένα διακριτικό σταυροειδές ("σταυροειδές") βλέμμα, με δύο μεγάλους λοβούς να προβάλλονται λίγο-πολύ οριζόντια από τη μεσοβίδα.<br/><br/>Η διατομή δεν είναι πάντα καλά αναπτυγμένη από άτομο σε άτομο, ωστόσο, ειδικά είναι ότι έχει υπάρξει οποιαδήποτε υβριδοποίηση σε εξέλιξη. (Τα είδη δρυός είναι διάσημα για την ανάμειξη τους μεταξύ τους.)<br/><br/>Και αυτό είναι ενδιαφέρον: ο καθηγητής Gray αναφέρεται σε αυτή τη βελανιδιά στο βιβλίο του χρησιμοποιώντας ένα λανθασμένο όνομα. Το σωστό και πρώτο έγκυρο όνομα προήλθε το 1787, γραμμένο από έναν Γερμανό βοτανολόγο ονόματι Friedrich von Wangenheim. Αλλά για κάποιο λόγο, ο Gray τύπωσε το όνομα Quercus obtusiloba, το οποίο είχε προταθεί από τον Γάλλο βοτανολόγο, Andre Michaux.<br/><br/>Ο Τζον Νέλσον είναι ο έφορος του A. C.
