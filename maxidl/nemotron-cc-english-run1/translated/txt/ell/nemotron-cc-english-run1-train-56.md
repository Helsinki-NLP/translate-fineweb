| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Ενώ το να αναγνωρίζεις ότι είναι αδύνατο να υποστηρίξεις κάποιον στο να αγαπήσει κάτι που μισεί, και το αντίστροφο, είναι ακόμα συχνά ευχάριστο να επιχειρείς το επιχείρημα. Όταν μιλάμε σε ανθρώπους των οποίων οι απόψεις έρχονται σε άμεση αντίθεση με τις δικές μας, είμαστε αναγκασμένοι να υπερασπιστούμε τα γούστα μας, να ορίσουμε τις απόψεις μας και να αναλύσουμε γιατί αντιδρούμε με τον τρόπο που αντιδρούμε. Γι' αυτό έχουμε το Why Don't You Like This?, στο οποίο δύο από τα στελέχη μας θα προσπαθήσουν να ανακαλύψουν αν οι άνθρωποι με αντίθετες απόψεις μπορούν να ξεπεράσουν το "Όχι, κάνεις λάθος!" και να έχουν μια αστική, εποικοδομητική, και ενδεχομένως ακόμη και πειστική συζήτηση για τα σημεία διαφωνίας τους. Γιατί ό,τι και να λέει το ράδιο της ομιλίας, υπάρχει ακόμα ένα μεσαίο έδαφος μεταξύ του "Συμφωνούμε απόλυτα" και του "Έχω δίκιο, και είσαι ηλίθιος και κακός".<br/><br/>Σκοτ: Από τότε που συζητούσαμε για το Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World αποστασία, ψάχναμε για μια υπόθεση όπου μπορώ να σε φωνάξω που δεν σου άρεσε κάτι υπέροχο, και δεν χρειάστηκε να ψάξουμε για πολύ. Καθόμασταν ακριβώς ο ένας δίπλα στον άλλο κατά τη διάρκεια του Ούγκοουμ του Μάρτιν Σκορσέζε, μαγεμένοι εντελώς από το φανταστικό του αφιέρωμα στα θαύματα του πρώιμου βωβού κινηματογράφου, και εσείς, προφανώς αντιστεκόμενοι σε αυτό σε κάθε στροφή. Κρίσιμη συναίνεση υπήρξε με το μέρος μου: Έφθασε στο νούμερο 9 στο συλλογικό Top 15 μας (αν και το αναφέρατε ως υπερτιμημένη επιλογή σας), έχει κερδίσει (ή τοποθετηθεί) σε διάφορα κινηματογραφικά-κριτικά βραβεία, και αυτή τη στιγμή απολαμβάνει μια βαθμολογία 83 στο Metacritic. Αυτό δεν σημαίνει ότι κάνεις λάθος, φυσικά, αλλά το φταίξιμο είναι πάνω σου για να εξηγήσεις γιατί ο Χιούγκο ήταν, κατά τα λόγια σου, "κούκλος και τεχνητός", όπου πολλοί από εμάς το είδαμε ως μια υπέροχη επίκληση της παιδικής ηλικίας του Σκορσέζε και του μέσου όταν ήταν ακόμα σε νηπιακή ηλικία. Και παρακαλώ να είστε ευγενικοί καθώς ξεσχίζετε αυτή την πεταλούδα από τα φτερά.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Τάσα: Δεν μπορώ να είμαι ευγενικός, Σκοτ. Μερικές φορές πονάει λιγότερο αν σκίσεις το τσιρότο με τη μία. (Και ακόμα κι αν δεν το κάνει, ποιος θέλει να κυκλοφορεί φορώντας ένα μισοτραβηγμένο τσιρότο; Αηδία.) Το γεγονός είναι, ότι βρήκα τον Χιούγκο να είναι μια κουραστική άσκηση χειραγώγησης στη πλαστογραφία, ξεκινώντας από το άνοιγμα της ολίσθησης μέσα από ένα σιδηροδρομικό σταθμό του Παρισιού, κάτι που μου θύμισε περισσότερο από οτιδήποτε άλλο το The Polar Express του Robert Zemeckis. Σε αντίθεση με τον Mike D'Angelo, είμαι οπαδός της μακράς, αδιάσπαστης παίρνει ως έναν τρόπο για την ίδρυση ενός χώρου και ενθαρρύνοντας τους θεατές να κρατήσουν ασυνείδητα τις αναπνοές τους καθώς μια κάμερα εξερευνά μια περιοχή? αλλά όταν ο χώρος που εξερευνάται είναι μια κηλίδα, λαμπερό δημιουργία CGI, και η κάμερα επιπλέει βαρέως μέσα από αυτό χωρίς φυσική αίσθηση ότι είτε η κάμερα ή το περιβάλλον είναι πραγματικά εκεί, ότι η εξερεύνηση αρχίζει να αισθάνεται σαν βλέποντας κάποιον άλλο να παίζει ένα βιντεοπαιχνίδι. Και η υπόλοιπη ταινία μου φάνηκε ομοίως ανυπόφορη και εξωπραγματική, τόσο από την άποψη του σκηνικού της όσο και από την πολύ επινοημένη, μοδάτη ιστορία της.<br/><br/>Δεν έχω απαραίτητα πρόβλημα με τα κατασκευασμένα, στυλιζαρισμένα περιβάλλοντα στις ταινίες. Αγαπούσα την εξίσου πλατιά, εντελώς τεχνητή εκδοχή του Μπαζ Λούρμαν για το Παρίσι στο Μουλέν Ρουζ, για παράδειγμα, αλλά αυτή η ταινία έχει μια αίσθηση της γελοιότητάς της, μια αίσθηση του χιούμορ σχετικά με το πόσο σκόπιμα υπερβάλλει. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, ιδιαίτερα στην Amélie. (Και ο Jeunet και ο Luhrmann αισθάνθηκαν έντονες οπτικές επιρροές εδώ.) Πήρα την αίσθηση, ωστόσο, ότι ο Martin Scorsese ήθελε να πάρω τον Hugo εντελώς σοβαρά. Ακόμα κι αν είναι άλλη μια συναισθηματικά φορτισμένη ιστορία για ένα θαρραλέο ορφανό που φέρνει το χρώμα πίσω στη ζωή ενός γκρινιάρα γερο-κουτσομπολιού και απλά δεν μπορούσα.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Δεν υπάρχει τίποτα που να μου αρέσει περισσότερο στον κινηματογράφο από το να εκπλήσσομαι και δεν υπάρχει τίποτα που να με δυσανασχετεί και να αντιστέκομαι περισσότερο από το να χειραγωγούμαι απροκάλυπτα, να μου λένε δυνατά τι να νιώσω και πότε να το νιώσω. Μια καλή ταινία κάνει αυτού του είδους τα πράγματα διακριτικά· μια κακή χρησιμοποιεί συντρίβοντας μουσικές νύξεις και γλυκές χορδές - και σε αυτή την περίπτωση, μια χονδροειδής, τεράστια μάτια, ατημέλητη ορφανή που κοιτάζει με θλιβερό βλέμμα την κάμερα - για να απαιτήσει πάθος, και για να πει στους θεατές ότι είναι απαίσιοι άνθρωποι αν δεν το σερβίρουν πάνω στη ζήτηση. Τούτου λεχθέντος, μπορώ να αντιμετωπίσω τα λυπημένα παιδιά και τους γκρινιάρικους ενήλικες κάνοντας τη ζωή καλύτερη ο ένας για τον άλλον - πραγματικά έσκαψα τη φετινή Χάβρη, η οποία ήταν ουσιαστικά η ίδια πλοκή χωρίς όλη τη νοστιμιά - αλλά βρίσκω τα τεχνητά περιβάλλοντα να αντανακλούν άσχημα τα τεχνητά συναισθήματα, και το καθένα κάνει το άλλο να φαίνεται πιο ψεύτικο με τη σειρά.<br/><br/>Ας ξεκινήσουμε με αυτό. Στο παραβλεπόμενο βίντεο ταινιών μας, εσύ και ο Νόελ πήγατε και οι δύο τον Κιθ στο καθήκον να υπερασπιστεί τον Τυραννόσαυρο, επειδή νιώθατε ότι δεν ήταν αρκετά ρεαλιστικό - πάρα πολύ σκηνοθετημένο, πάρα πολύ miserablist, πάρα πολύ, πάρα πολύ μακριά. Πώς είναι δυνατόν να μην μπορείς να αγοράσεις ένα μεθυστικό γεροξεκούτη που σπάει πράγματα όταν είναι θυμωμένος, αλλά μπορείς να αγοράσεις ένα ορφανό που ζει μέσα σε ένα γιγαντιαίο ρολόι τρένου-σταθμού και να ξεκινήσει ένα ιδιότροπο ταξίδι για να επισκευάσει ένα μυστηριώδες αυτόματο που πιστεύει ότι μπορεί να φέρει μυστικά από τον νεκρό πατέρα του, αλλά το οποίο αντίθετα τον οδηγεί σε ένα ιδιόρρυθμο ταξίδι αυτοανακάλυψης, στη μαγική γη του κινηματογράφου; Δεν βρήκες ποτέ το φανταχτερό σχέδιο ροκοκό του Χιούγκο, το επιθετικό καρδιοχτύπισμα, ή τα φορτωμένα με καροτσάκια μπερδέματα ακόμα και λίγο υπερβολικό ή δύσκολο να τα καταπιείς;<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Σκοτ: Ο Γιούνετ και ο Λούρμαν ως επιρροές στον Σκορσέζε; Ξεχάστε να είστε αδιάκριτοι, τώρα με σπρώχνετε επίτηδες με ένα κοφτερό ραβδί. Αν ψάχνεις για εμπνεύσεις για τον Ούγκο -πράγματι, αν ψάχνεις για τον συναισθηματικό πυρήνα του Ούγκο- πρέπει να επιστρέψεις στην παιδική ηλικία του Σκορσέζε στην οδό Ελίζαμπεθ στη Μικρή Ιταλία, όπου ένα ασθματικό αγοράκι, ανίκανο να παίξει έξω με τα άλλα παιδιά, υποχώρησε σε φαντασιώσεις του Αλεξάντερ Κόρντα όπως ο Κλέφτης της Βαγδάτης. Ή, πιο απλά, απλά πηγαίνετε κατευθείαν στην πηγή ο ίδιος: Ο Τζορτζ Μελιές, του οποίου το A Trip To The Moon παραμένει η Μεγάλη Έκρηξη όλων των κινηματογραφικών φαντασιώσεων, εκείνη τη στιγμή που η κάμερα δεν χρησιμοποιήθηκε για να τεκμηριώσει τον κόσμο όπως είναι, αλλά ό,τι ιδιότροπο, μαγικό, μεταφέρει ένα μέρος που ένας κινηματογραφιστής θέλει να εφεύρει γι' αυτό. Και αυτή η παράδοση έχει αναπτυχθεί και επεκταθεί εδώ και δεκαετίες πριν οι όμοιοι του Jeunet και Luhrmann πάρουν πάνω τους τα χονδροειδή μικρά πόδια τους.<br/><br/>Και μιλώντας για τον Jeunet, ωραία προσπάθεια να μου πάρει το ρητορικό μου όπλο, αλλά θα το πω ούτως ή άλλως: Πώς μπορείς να αγαπάς την Amélie, αλλά να βρίσκεις τον Hugo συνθετικό και "υπερβολικό" και "επαισθητοποιημένο"; Λέτε ότι η Amélie και ο Moulin Rouge έχουν εξιλεώσει "την ανοησία τους" όπου Scorsese σημαίνει να πάρουμε τον Hugo στα σοβαρά, και δεν νομίζω ότι αυτό συμβαίνει, τουλάχιστον στο τελευταίο σημείο. Το ότι ο Σκορσέζε νιώθει εμφανές πάθος για τις ταινίες είναι, υποθέτω, ο λόγος που θα ερμηνεύατε τον Χιούγκο ως αυτο-σοβαρό. Και οι τρεις ταινίες κάνουν επιθετική χρήση των θαυμάτων του CGI-και ο Σκορσέζε προσθέτει 3D στο μείγμα, σε θαυμάσιο αποτέλεσμα-αλλά όπου εσύ και εγώ διαφέρουμε είναι στο θέμα της έλλειψης βαρύτητας. Συμφωνώ ότι το CGI έχει αποστασιοποιητικό αποτέλεσμα· οι κόσμοι που αποτελούνται εξ ολοκλήρου από ψηφιακή πλαστελίνη είναι ευέλικτοι στο σημείο όπου μερικές φορές δεν έχουν παρουσία. Αναφερθήκατε στον Χιούγκο στην "Υπερεκτιμημένη" είσοδό σας για το κομμάτι Best Of Film μας ως "CGI gimcrack" - μια τέλεια dis... για μια άλλη ταινία.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Είναι δίκαιο να πούμε ότι ο Σκορσέζε έχει χτίσει τον Χιούγκο γύρω από ένα πρότυπο-τεύχος, "heartstring-plucking" παιδικό βιβλίο/ταινία πλοκή: Ο Ορφανός χάνει τον μπαμπά του, δημιουργεί το δικό του μικρό φανταστικό κόσμο, gloms επάνω σε ένα νέο φίλο, πείθει ένα crusty old fuddy-duddy να μαλακώσει και ίσως να τον υιοθετήσει. Αλλά αυτό είναι απλά ο αφηγηματικός σκελετός, και ο Σκορσέζε παρέχει άφθονη σάρκα και αίμα. Πρώτον, δεν μπορείς να δεις τον Χιούγκο, το μοναχικό αγόρι, να κοιτάει από πύργους ρολογιού μέχρι το θόρυβο ενός σιδηροδρομικού σταθμού του Παρισιού χωρίς να σκέφτεται τον Σκορσέζε, ένα άλλο μοναχικό αγόρι, να κοιτάζει έξω από το παράθυρο του υπνοδωματίου του στην οδό Ελίζαμπεθ. Και ακόμα κι αν δεν είσαι αρκετά μεγάλος σπασίκλας για να κάνεις αυτή τη σύνδεση, πραγματικά αισθάνομαι ότι το ταξίδι του Χιούγκο δεν είναι να βρει μια νέα πατρική φιγούρα, αλλά να επιμείνει στη μηχανική μαγεία που στέκεται ως κληρονομιά του ίδιου του πατέρα του. Αυτό είναι το φιλμ: Η επιμονή του οράματος που μας επιτρέπει να δεχτούμε μια απατηλή εκδοχή του κόσμου στα 24 καρέ το δευτερόλεπτο είναι επιστήμη και μαγεία ταυτόχρονα. Η σχέση του Χιούγκο με τον Μελίς δεν έχει να κάνει με το να συμφιλιωθεί με έναν νέο μπαμπά, αλλά να μοιραστεί έναν κοινό ενθουσιασμό που ο γέρος έχει βυθίσει στην πικρία.<br/><br/>Δεν βρήκατε πραγματικά κανένα από τα μαγευτικά του Ούγκο; Ακόμα και οι λίγοι επικριτές της ταινίας φαίνεται πρόθυμοι να παραδεχτούν ότι οι ακολουθίες που έφεραν στο νου την ιστορία του κινηματογράφου και το στούντιο του Μελίς -με τον Μάικλ Στουλμπάργκ ως τον ηρωικό μελετητή του κινηματογράφου!- ήταν φοβερές. Ένιωθα, με τον καλύτερο δυνατό τρόπο, σαν μια μεθυστική συμπίεση της τάξης μου Ιστορία της Ταινίας 101 στο κολέγιο, συμπυκνώνοντας τα κλιπ και τα συμφραζόμενα ενός εξαμήνου σε κάτι μεταξύ ενός μοντάζ και ενός αναδυόμενου βιβλίου κινουμένων σχεδίων. Και μιλάει για τον ευφυέστατο σχεδιασμό της ταινίας, ο οποίος στρώνει την πραγματικότητα και τη φαντασίωση τόσο όμορφα που είναι ταυτόχρονα μια ιστορία του Mιλιές και η γέννηση του κινηματογράφου, και ακριβώς το είδος της απλής, πλούσιας παραγωγής κινηματογραφικού θαυμασμού που ο ίδιος ο Σκορσέζε θα είχε αγαπήσει ως παιδί. Δόξα τω Θεώ ο Hugo δεν ακολουθεί το μοντέλο Jeunet/Luhrmann και έχει "μια αίσθηση της γελοιότητάς του." Σαν γνώστης της φαντασίας κι εσύ, δεν θα έλεγες ότι έχει αξία να το παίζεις ευθύς και ένθερμος και ατάραχος αντί να κλείνεις το μάτι στο κοινό; Μπορεί να βρίσκεις τον Χιούγκο αρρωστημένα γλυκό, αλλά δεν νομίζω ότι η αυθεντικότητα του συναισθήματός του πρέπει να αμφισβητηθεί.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Τάσα: Ναι, στην πραγματικότητα βρήκα μέρη του Ούγκο μαγευτικά. (Παρατηρήστε πώς απαντώ στην ερώτησή σας μπροστά, ενώ ήσασταν πολύ απασχολημένοι με το φρύδι με αποπληξία για να απευθύνεστε στη δική μου, αν και υποθέτω ότι αυτή είναι μια απάντηση από μόνη της. Εντάξει, το "influence" μπορεί να είναι υπερβολή της υπόθεσης-εννοούσα απλά ότι το οπτικό στυλ φαινόταν πολύ οικείο. Αν και όπως τόνισε ο Κιθ όταν το ανέφερες αυτό αυτοπροσώπως, ο Σκορσέζε δεν αντιτίθεται ούτε στο να αντλήσει έμπνευση από τα οπτικά των άλλων ανθρώπων, ούτε στο να έχει ανοσία σε αυτό.) Πρωτίστως, μαγεύτηκα από τα μέρη που ασχολούνταν με το backstory του Ζωρζ Μελιές, με την αγάπη του για τον κινηματογράφο, με το έργο που έβαλε στην τέχνη του και τη χαρά που έβγαλε από αυτό. Υπάρχει πάρα πολλή ομορφιά και διασκέδαση στη σκηνοθεσία της υποθαλάσσιας σκηνής από το "Fairyland" του Μελίς, και στην ακολουθία στο τέλος, εστιάζοντας στα πλάνα του Μελίς. Θα σας παραδεχτώ ότι η σύνδεση του Χιούγκο με τον Μελιές πάνω από μια κοινή αγάπη για την ταινία είναι μια ωραία πινελιά και μου αρέσει μια καλή ταινία για την κινηματογράφηση.<br/><br/>Αλλά ο Χιούγκο δεν έχει να κάνει κυρίως με την ταινία, παρά τα δεσμά του Μελιές. Εκτός από τα θέματα που αναφέρετε, έχει να κάνει και με την εύρεση του σκοπού σας, όπως ρητά εξηγούν οι χαρακτήρες, με κόπο ο ένας στον άλλο και σε εμάς. Και έχει να κάνει με θέαμα, και μεγάλα σετ δράσης, και κυνηγητά, και χαρούμενα-ακόμη-μετά-τέλη όπου ακόμα και ο θυμωμένος νταής και το ντροπαλό ηλικιωμένο ζευγάρι και fergawdsakes ακόμα και ο δύστροπος dachshund όλα ζευγαρώνουν με γοητευτικά ερωτικά ενδιαφέροντα μέχρι το τέλος. Έχει να κάνει με την υπερπροκατάληπτη Ερμιόνη Γκρέιντζερ που είναι αυταρχική και ζωηρή και έξυπνη και εγκωμιάζει τους μαγικούς κόσμους που είναι κλεισμένοι στα βιβλία και όλη αυτή η επιχείρηση είναι πολύ οικεία, και πολύ τεχνητή.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Ναι, ο Σκορσέζε παίζει με αρχέτυπα, το πρόβλημα είναι ότι ποτέ δεν ένιωσα ότι τα εμποτίζει με κάτι νέο, φρέσκο, ή πιστευτό, παρά το δικό του παρελθόν. Θα προτιμούσα πολύ μια ιστορία για έναν νεαρό Σκορτσέζο που μεγαλώνει με άσθμα-κάτι μικρής κλίμακας και πραγματικό, χωρίς απέραντα δωμάτια γεμάτα ρολόι CGI και χρυσές λαμπερές σκονάδες και προφητικά όνειρα και έναν μαινόμενο ενήλικα τύραννο-φρουρό με μια καρδιά από χρυσό-όλα αυτά τα υπερμεγέθη, πάνω από την κορυφή ανοησίες. Συνεχίζεις να επικαλείσαι το προσωπικό υπόβαθρο του Σκορσέζε και την αγάπη του για την ταινία ως απόδειξη ότι πραγματικά αισθάνεται αυτό που βάζει στην οθόνη, αλλά δεν αισθάνομαι την προσωπική του επαφή σε τίποτα από όλα αυτά, εκτός από τις στιγμές που είναι ρητά για την ταινία. Τα βασικά συναισθήματα μπορεί να είναι αληθινά, αλλά αυτό δεν κάνει την εκτέλεση λιγότερο ψεύτικη.<br/><br/>Λες ότι η αυθεντικότητα του συναισθήματος δεν πρέπει να αμφισβητηθεί. Δεν αμφισβητώ αν ο Σκορσέζε ένιωθε μόνος και απομονωμένος ως παιδί, αλλά δεν αισθάνομαι μοναξιά και απομόνωση στην οθόνη-βλέπω ένα μάτσο υπερβολικούς σημαίνοντες (ο Χούγκο είναι βρώμικος και τα ρούχα του είναι φθαρμένα και όλοι οι ενήλικες του φωνάζουν και τον κυνηγάει τακτικά ένας τρομακτικός σκύλος!) και μεγάλοι χτύπους, με φωνές και κλάματα και σπιελβέργες θαυμασμούς. Για μένα, η ειλικρίνεια είναι πιο πειστική και πιο προσωπική όταν είναι ήσυχη και άμεση· όταν κάποιος μου φωνάζει τις απόψεις του, υποθέτω ότι είτε είναι πραγματικά θυμωμένος, είτε απλά προσπαθεί να κατακλύσει τις αισθήσεις μου για να με κρατήσει από το να εκφράσω τη δική μου γνώμη. Ο Χιούγκο ήταν μια μεγάλη κραυγή, όσον αφορά εμένα.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Γιατί δεν πήρα αυτή την αίσθηση της πλαστογραφίας από την Amélie, ρωτάς; Θα αναγνωρίσω πλήρως ότι η Amélie και η Moulin Rouge είναι και οι δύο μεγάλες, χειραγωγικές, τεχνητές κατασκευές στο ίδιο ακριβώς πνεύμα, απαιτώντας συγκεκριμένα συναισθήματα σε συγκεκριμένα χρονικά διαστήματα, και προσπαθώντας να πουλήσουμε αυτά τα συναισθήματα με βαριά εμψύχωση και επιθετική προώθηση soundtrack. Κανένας από τους δύο δεν με πούλησε πραγματικά στα συναισθήματά τους ως αυθεντικό ανθρώπινο συναίσθημα. Αυτό που απόλαυσα σε αυτές τις δύο ταινίες ήταν η κατασκευή-ιδιαίτερα οι μεθυστικές, γελαστικές λίστες της Amélie με τυχαία χαρακτηριστικά και εμπειρίες για το καστ της, και τα μουσικά-μαγικά mashups και recontextualizations του Moulin Rouge. Συχνά πουλάω ιστορίες που κάνουν δημιουργικά ή φιλόδοξα πράγματα με δομή, και οι δύο αυτές ταινίες πληρούν τις προϋποθέσεις, όπου ο Χιούγκο είναι ένα πολύ πιο γραμμικό, τυπικό παιδικό-ζήτημα.<br/><br/>Αλλά στο τέλος, για μένα, πραγματικά καταλήγει σε μια αίσθηση ότι αυτές οι ταινίες είναι χαζομάρες, ενώ ο Hugo προορίζεται να λαμβάνεται σοβαρά υπόψη σε κάθε τραγική στιγμή. Δεν νομίζετε ότι αυτό είναι αλήθεια - αλλά ταυτόχρονα υπερασπίζεστε την ακεραιότητά του όσον αφορά το απολύτως αυθεντικό, ριζωμένο στην ιστορία συναίσθημα του Σκορσέζε, και μου λέτε ότι κάνω λάθος, και δεν σημαίνει ότι πρέπει να ληφθεί σοβαρά υπόψη. Πώς συμβιβάζεις αυτές τις δύο δηλώσεις; Τι γίνεται με την ταινία που σου προτείνει ότι δεν είναι γραφτό να ληφθεί στην ονομαστική αξία; Και είναι πιθανό αυτή να είναι μια άλλη περίεργη περίπτωση του Μπέντζαμιν Μπάτον, όπου βρίσκω τη χρήση των παιδιών σε ταινίες μεγάλου προϋπολογισμού να είναι σε μεγάλο βαθμό ατημέλητη και μελοδραματική, ενώ εσύ ως μπαμπάς το βρίσκεις να παρακάμπτει τον κυνισμό σου και να πηγαίνει κατευθείαν στο οικογενειακό σου συναίσθημα;<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Σκοτ: Δεν είμαι σίγουρος ότι εννοούσα ότι ο Σκορσέζε δεν σημαίνει να τον παίρνουν στα σοβαρά· είναι απλά ότι έχει επιλέξει ένα ιδιότροπο όχημα μέσω του οποίου θα εκφράσει μια σοβαρή αγάπη για τις ταινίες. Όταν λες, "Αλλά ο Χιούγκο δεν έχει να κάνει κυρίως με την ταινία, παρά τις γραβάτες του Μελιές," είμαι μπερδεμένος. Παραδέχομαι ότι βρίσκεις πολλά στοιχεία του Χιούγκο υπερβολικά οικεία και επίπονα και γεμάτα σπιελμπεργκιανή θαυματουργή συγκίνηση - δεν υπάρχει τίποτα που μπορώ να κάνω για να διαφωνήσω γύρω από αυτή την αντίληψη, την οποία μοιράζονται και άλλοι αμφισβητούντες τον Χιούγκο. Μερικές φορές μια ταινία σημαίνει να γοητεύεις και να γοητεύεις, και δεν το κάνει για κάποιους· έχεις τον Χιούγκο και έχω την Αμιλί, αν και νομίζω ότι η τελευταία, σκόπιμα τεχνητή όπως είναι, σημαίνει για μας να τη βρούμε ρομαντική. (Αντί, ας πούμε, κάποιο φρικτό μηχανικό μαραφέτι κατάλληλο για μια συνέχεια του Saw.)<br/><br/>Αλλά για να πούμε ότι ο Χιούγκο δεν έχει να κάνει κυρίως με την ταινία; Αν δεν έχει να κάνει με την ταινία, τότε είναι η πιο άσκοπη διεγερτική ιστορία για [ό,τι νομίζετε ότι αφορά] που έχω δει ποτέ. Η σχέση μεταξύ του Χιούγκο και του Μελίς είναι η καρδιά της ταινίας, και στο επίκεντρο της δεν είναι απλά κάποια σχέση αποθεμάτων μεταξύ του Πλάκι Ορφανού και του Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, αλλά μια κοινή συγγένεια για τη μηχανική μαγεία-συγκεκριμένα τη μαγεία των ταινιών. Νομίζω ότι ο Σκορσέζε και οι συνεργάτες του έχουν βρει έναν τρόπο να εκφράσουν τον ενθουσιασμό τους για τις πρώτες μέρες του κινηματογράφου μέσα από μια φαντασίωση που είναι προσβάσιμη σε όλες τις ηλικίες. Το παιδικό παραμύθι γεμάτο αρχέτυπα είναι απλώς η κρούστα εδώ· ο κινηματογράφος είναι η πίτα. (Mmmm... πίτα.)<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Όσο για την Περίεργη Περίπτωση του Μπέντζαμιν Μπάτον, δεν βλέπω μεγάλη σύνδεση, εκτός από το να προσπαθώ να με εκθέσω ως υπερασπιστή του Μπέντζαμιν Μπάτον ως τρόπο να βλάψω την αξιοπιστία μου. (Παρεμπιπτόντως, πώς είναι τα έξτρα σε αυτό το G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray;) Σου έχω πει ότι ο στερημένος από τον ύπνο νέος μπαμπάς μέσα μου ήταν ίσως ευάλωτος στον Μπέντζαμιν Μπάτον, αλλά δεν μπορώ να φανταστώ μια εποχή που η προϋπόθεση της γήρανσης αντίστροφα δεν θα με συγκινούσε. Και εκτός αυτού, δεν βλέπω πώς ο Μπέντζαμιν Μπάτον αφηγείται πολλά για τον Χιούγκο ως ταινία που αφορά τα παιδιά, αφού αυτό είναι μόνο ένα μικρό κομμάτι μιας ιστορίας που εκτείνεται σε μια πολύ μεγαλύτερη τροχιά.<br/><br/>Έτσι σε έπεισα; Πιθανότατα όχι. Αλλά χαίρομαι που μαθαίνω ότι ο Χιούγκο δεν στερούνταν εντελώς μαγικά για σένα. Οι ακολουθίες στον Μελιές τον κινηματογραφιστή είναι αυτό που έβαλε τον Χιούγκο για μένα - και σε αυτό, τουλάχιστον, μπορούμε να μοιραστούμε κάποια κινηματογραφική αγάπη.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Τάσα: Όχι, δεν μπορώ να πω ότι με έπεισες, όπως δεν σε έπεισα, είναι αδύνατο να υποστηρίξεις κάποιον σε μια σπλαχνική αγάπη για οτιδήποτε, και πραγματικά θα πρέπει να είναι εξίσου αδύνατο να πείσεις κάποιον από σπλαχνική αγάπη. Κυρίως, με άφησες να δω τον Hugo στο Scott-O-Vision, το οποίο είναι μια ενδιαφέρουσα εμπειρία· τουλάχιστον τώρα είμαι ελαφρώς πεπεισμένος ότι δεν καταφέραμε με κάποιο τρόπο να δούμε εντελώς διαφορετικές ταινίες που και οι δύο είχαν κατά κάποιο τρόπο το ίδιο όνομα και σκηνοθέτη.<br/><br/>Σίγουρα είχαμε διαφορετικές εμπειρίες, όμως, και στο μυαλό μου, επικεντρωμένες σε διαφορετικές πτυχές της παραγωγής: Εξακολουθώ να μην βλέπω το θέμα "η ταινία είναι υπέροχη" ως το ενιαίο σκέλος της ταινίας, τόσο όσο ένα ανάμεσα σε πάρα πολλά. Το "αναπόφευκτα διεγερμένο" σχεδόν το καλύπτει, αν και θα πετούσα "συχνά άσκοπα χαριτωμένο και πολύτιμο" πάνω από αυτό. Ενώ είσαι συγκεντρωμένος στο νόστιμο γέμισμα της πίτας της ταινίας, νιώθω ότι η πίτα ήταν καλυμμένη με μια λίβρα κρυσταλλικής ζάχαρης, και νομίζω ότι αυτό κάνει τη διαφορά, ανεξάρτητα από το βασικό μήνυμα της ταινίας ή μια χούφτα από υπέροχες σκηνές. Δείτε επίσης Μπέντζαμιν Μπάτον, το οποίο δεν ανέφερα απλώς για να σας τσαλαβουτήσω - πραγματικά πιστεύω ότι έχετε περισσότερο συναισθηματικό σερί από ό, τι έχω όσον αφορά τα παιδιά στον κινηματογράφο, ειδικά όταν χρησιμοποιούνται περισσότερο ως σύμβολα ευπάθειας και αθωότητας παρά ως ανθρώπινοι χαρακτήρες. Ξέρεις ποια ταινία δεν έχει καθόλου χαριτωμένα φαρδιά μάτια που να φέρνουν ελπίδα σε έναν κυνικό κόσμο; G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Ίσως θα πάω να δω αυτά τα Blu-ray έξτρα. θα μπορούσα να χρησιμοποιήσω κάποια έκρηξη-ινσουλίνη για να αντισταθμίσω τη γλυκύτητα του Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Ήλπιζα ότι η κόρη μου θα ήταν ελεύθερη από δύσκολες και ανησυχητικές στιγμές": Η ιστορία του Mee Mee ως πρόσφυγα μαμά<br/><br/>Ελπίδα σε Χρόνους Κρίσης: Μια Ιστορία της Ημέρας της Μητέρας<br/><br/>Της Τζούντιθ Σαντιάγο*<br/><br/>Ο Mee Mee άκουσε ότι οι στρατιώτες έρχονταν. Πήρε στα χέρια της το γιο της και ένωσε μανιωδώς τους υπόλοιπους χωρικούς που έτρεχαν προς τα σύνορα Ταϊλάνδης-Βιρμανίας, όπου βρισκόταν το Γραφείο του ύπατου αρμοστή των Ηνωμένων Εθνών για τους Πρόσφυγες (UNHCR). Ο σύζυγός της βρισκόταν σε ένα άλλο χωριό τρέχοντας προς την αντίθετη κατεύθυνση, το έμαθε αργότερα ο Μι. Μετά το τέλος της καταδίωξης των στρατιωτών, η Μι επέστρεψε στο σπίτι της στο μικρό της χωριό στο Κόετσι της Βιρμανίας.<br/><br/>Κατά τη διάρκεια του 1997-2000, η Mee και χιλιάδες σαν αυτήν ζούσαν υπό τη συνεχή απειλή βίας από Βιρμανούς στρατιώτες. Πολλοί άνθρωποι θα έβρισκαν προσωρινό καταφύγιο στη ζούγκλα, και θα επέστρεφαν στην πατρίδα τους στο χωριό τους αφού οι στρατιώτες έφυγαν από την περιοχή, απλά για να το ξανακάνουν μέρες αργότερα. Περίπου μία φορά την εβδομάδα, ο Mee και άλλοι θα ήταν σε κίνηση για να αποφύγουν τη σύλληψη, το βιασμό ή το θάνατο από στρατιώτες.<br/><br/>Κατά τη διάρκεια ενός περιστατικού, ο σύζυγος της Mee έτρεξε μπροστά από τη σύζυγό του για να εξασφαλίσει τροφή για την οικογένειά του. Η σφαίρα θρυμμάτισε ένα τμήμα των πλευρών του, αφήνοντάς τον σοβαρά τραυματισμένο και σε κίνδυνο καθώς ταξίδευε προς τη ζούγκλα με την οικογένειά του για ασφάλεια.<br/><br/>Για τρεις μήνες, ο σύζυγος του Mee κρύφτηκε και μετακίνησε την οικογένεια με μια εξοργιστική πληγή στο πλευρό του.<br/><br/>"Φοβόμουν να επιστρέψω στη Βιρμανία", είπε η Μι μέσω διερμηνέα. "Φοβόμουν τον θάνατο. Έκλαιγα και έκλαιγα κάθε μέρα", συνέχισε.<br/><br/>Ο σύζυγος της Mee τελικά τράβηξε αρκετή δύναμη για να περπατήσει πέντε ημέρες προς ένα μικρό χωριό στην Ταϊλάνδη όπου έμαθαν την τοποθεσία ενός νοσοκομείου και ενός στρατοπέδου προσφύγων. Όταν ο Mee και ο σύζυγός της έφτασαν τελικά στο νοσοκομείο, υποβλήθηκε σε άμεση χειρουργική επέμβαση και αργότερα ανάρρωσε.<br/><br/>Σύμβολο της Ελπίδας<br/><br/>Η ζωή στη ζούγκλα για όσους έφευγαν από τους Βιρμανούς στρατιώτες ήταν πράγματι τρομακτική και δύσκολη. Οι αυτοσχέδιες σκηνές από μπαμπού με μόνο στέγη και καλύμματα δαπέδων έγιναν κατάλληλες προσωρινές κατοικίες. Πολλές γυναίκες συμπεριλαμβανομένου του Μι γέννησαν παιδιά στη ζούγκλα. Ο τότε εξάχρονος γιος του Mee βοήθησε στην παράδοση της αδελφής του με το όνομα Eh Ku Hser. Το όνομά της σημαίνει αγάπη – κρύο – γλυκό. "Κρύο" στην κουλτούρα της Βιρμανίας σημαίνει έτσι ώστε να μην περάσει μέσα από τη φωτιά της ζωής, καθώς η θερμότητα αντιπροσωπεύει ταραγμένους καιρούς.<br/><br/>"Ήλπιζα ότι η κόρη μου θα ήταν ελεύθερη από δύσκολες και ανησυχητικές στιγμές", είπε η Mee. "Δεν ήθελα να περάσει αυτό που είχα βιώσει", συνέχισε.<br/><br/>Για την Mee, η γέννηση της κόρης της εν μέσω σκότους, βασάνων και φόβου, ήταν ένα σύμβολο ελπίδας για μια νέα ζωή που θα ερχόταν. Ελπίδα σε περιόδους κρίσης, η ίδια η προϋπόθεση της United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) πρόσφατα συν-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, είναι επίσης η ουσία αυτού που τα κεριά ρίχνουν φως πάνω.<br/><br/>Μια Νέα Αρχή<br/><br/>Με τη βοήθεια της UNHCR, η ελπίδα για μια νέα ζωή υλοποιήθηκε πράγματι για την Mee και την οικογένειά της όταν επανεγκαταστάθηκαν στο Δυτικό Σπρίνγκφιλντ της Μασαχουσέτης. Εκεί, η Mee συνάντησε την Moo Kho Paw, μια άλλη γυναίκα που μετανάστευσε από τη Βιρμανία, και η οποία εργαζόταν στο Prosperity Candle στη Φλωρεντία. Η οργάνωση βοηθά τις γυναίκες πρόσφυγες που έχουν ξεφύγει από περιοχές συγκρούσεων να ξαναχτίσουν τη ζωή τους μέσα από την τέχνη της κατασκευής κεριών. Ο Moo Kho συνέστησε στον Mee να ενταχθεί στην οργάνωση, και ο Mee δέχτηκε με χαρά.<br/><br/>"Ήμουν ενθουσιασμένη που θα έλειπα από το σπίτι", είπε η Mee, "μεγάλωσα πιστεύοντας ότι επειδή ήμουν γυναίκα, ο ρόλος μου ήταν να παραμείνω στο σπίτι και να μεγαλώσω την οικογένειά μου", συνέχισε. "Ενώ πολλές Βιρμανές γυναίκες θέλουν να κάνουν περισσότερα για τον εαυτό τους, συχνά ενθαρρύνονται να παραμείνουν νοικοκυρές".<br/><br/>Σήμερα, η Mee έχει σχέδια να πάει στην επιχείρηση παραγωγής κεριών για τον εαυτό της και να υποστηρίξει τα πέντε παιδιά της, αλλά εξέφρασε την ανάγκη να μάθει πρώτα αγγλικά.<br/><br/>"Στο στρατόπεδο προσφύγων της Ταϊλάνδης, είχαμε εκπαίδευση, αλλά δεν ήταν τόσο καλή", είπε ο Mee. "Όταν ήμουν παιδί, ήθελα να πάω στο σχολείο, αλλά μου είπαν να μείνω στο σπίτι επειδή ήμουν γυναίκα. Τώρα, έχω ελπίδες για τις κόρες μου να πάνε στο κολέγιο και να γίνουν γιατροί ή γυναίκες της αστυνομίας", συνέχισε ο Mee.<br/><br/>Η Mee έχει πετύχει μια ισόρροπη ισορροπία στη ζωή της που εύχεται να έβρισκαν οι άλλοι - μια απλή, ευτυχισμένη ζωή όπου η εργασία, η φροντίδα για τα μέλη της οικογένειας και η ελευθερία επιλογής έχουν όλοι τη θέση τους.<br/><br/>Υποστήριξη Προσφύγων Γυναικών στις ΗΠΑ<br/><br/>Μοιράσου αυτή την ιστορία της Ημέρας της Μητέρας με τους αγαπημένους σου. Και, όταν αγοράζετε χειροποίητα κεριά από τον Mee, τον Moo Kho, και την Naw, μια άλλη Βιρμανίδα πρόσφυγα που εργάζεται στο Prosperity Candle , ξέρετε ότι βοηθάτε στην υποστήριξη του βιοπορισμού τους καθώς ξαναχτίζουν τις ζωές τους και αυτές των μελών της οικογένειάς τους στις ΗΠΑ. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Η θετική δράση είναι το αποτέλεσμα του κινήματος των Πολιτικών Δικαιωμάτων του 1960, που αναπτύχθηκε έξω από τον Νόμο για τα Πολιτικά Δικαιώματα του 1964 ο οποίος έθεσε εκτός νόμου τις διακρίσεις με βάση τη φυλή, την εθνικότητα ή το φύλο. Ήταν η απόφαση του Ανώτατου Δικαστηρίου του 1978, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, η οποία επέτρεπε τη χρήση προτιμήσεων με βάση τη φυλή ως μέσο για την προώθηση της διαφορετικότητας, επιτρέποντας τη χρήση καταφατικής δράσης στις πολιτικές εισαγωγών. Δημιουργήθηκε με την πρόθεση να παρέχει ίσες ευκαιρίες για τα μέλη των μειονοτικών ομάδων στην εκπαίδευση και ...να βλέπουν στη μέση του εγγράφου...<br/><br/>Ωστόσο, σύμφωνα με μια έκθεση του 2007 του Pew Research Center, η υποστήριξη για θετική δράση μεταξύ του αμερικανικού κοινού έχει αυξηθεί ουσιαστικά τα τελευταία χρόνια, ανεβαίνοντας από το 58% το 1995 στο 70% το 2007. Οι υποστηρικτές της θετικής δράσης κάνουν πολλά επιχειρήματα υπέρ της θετικής δράσης, με την ελπίδα να κάνουν τους άλλους να δουν το γνήσιο καλό που φέρνουν οι πολιτικές της θετικής δράσης στην κοινωνία μας. Οι υποστηρικτές πιστεύουν ότι η θετική δράση είναι περισσότερο μια διαδικασία παρά μια πολιτική εισαγωγής. Τα κολέγια και τα πανεπιστήμια αναλαμβάνουν την επιπλέον πρωτοβουλία να προσεγγίσουν τις μειονοτικές ομάδες, ενθαρρύνοντάς τις να υποβάλουν αίτηση. Τα κολέγια και τα πανεπιστήμια προσφέρουν πρόσθετη οικονομική βοήθεια και παρέχουν πόρους στην πανεπιστημιούπολη για να βοηθήσουν στην καλύτερη πανεπιστημιακή εκπαίδευση του φοιτητή. Οι υποστηρικτές σημειώνουν επίσης τον αυξανόμενο αριθμό αιτήσεων μειοψηφίας σε κολέγια και πανεπιστήμια που οφείλονται εν μέρει σε πολιτικές καταφατικής δράσης.<br/>Οι στατιστικές έχουν αποδείξει ότι όταν εξαλείφεται η καταφατική δράση, όπως όταν ήταν στο Berkley College και το UCLA το 1998, οι εισαγωγές φοιτητών μειοψηφίας μειώθηκαν 61 τοις εκατό και 36 τοις εκατό αντίστοιχα, αποδεικνύοντας ότι η καταφατική δράση παίζει σημαντικό ρόλο σε μια διαδικασία εισδοχής φοιτητών μειοψηφίας. Οι υποστηρικτές της θετικής δράσης πιστεύουν επίσης ότι η ποικιλομορφία στην τριτοβάθμια εκπαίδευση παρέχει μια καλύτερη εκπαιδευτική ατμόσφαιρα για όλους τους μαθητές, προσωπικά και πνευματικά. Αν εξαλείφονταν οι καταφατικές ενέργειες, θα υπήρχαν λιγότεροι φοιτητές μειοψηφίας που θα ήταν εγγεγραμμένοι σε κολέγια, με αποτέλεσμα η ποικιλομορφία να είναι αρκετά ισχνή. Οι πολιτικές θετικής δράσης είναι επίσης απαραίτητες προκειμένου να αντισταθμιστούν για αιώνες η φυλετική, οικονομική και κοινωνική καταπίεση. Τα άτομα με υψηλότερη κοινωνικοοικονομική κατάσταση έχουν περισσότερες ευκαιρίες από εκείνα με χαμηλότερο κοινωνικοοικονομικό υπόβαθρο. Οι υποστηρικτές πιστεύουν ότι ορισμένες φυλετικές ή εθνοτικές ομάδες μειονεκτούν επειδή συχνά βρίσκονται σε νοικοκυριά χαμηλότερου εισοδήματος και κατά συνέπεια δεν εκτίθενται στους ίδιους πόρους με τους μαθητές από ανώτερες κοινωνικοοικονομικές τάξεις. Οι συνήγοροι υποστηρίζουν την έννοια του ανταγωνισμού μεταξύ των φοιτητών με βάση την αξία, αλλά υποστηρίζουν ότι η θετική δράση αντισταθμίζει τις οικονομικές διαφορές. Οι απόφοιτοι κολλεγίων, οι οποίοι έχουν επωφεληθεί από την καταφατική δράση, έχουν επίσης πει ότι έλαβαν καλύτερες θέσεις εργασίας, κέρδισαν περισσότερα χρήματα και συνολικά ζουν καλύτερη ζωή λόγω των ευτυχών ευκαιριών που έλαβαν μέσω της καταφατικής δράσης.<br/>Οι υποστηρικτές της θετικής δράσης τονίζουν συνεχώς τη σοβαρή σημασία της θετικής δράσης, λαμβάνοντας υπόψη τις συνεισφορές της στην ενίσχυση τόσο της εμπειρίας του κολλεγίου όσο και της κοινωνίας γενικότερα. Ωστόσο, οι πολέμιοι της καταφατικής δράσης πιστεύουν ότι έχει έρθει η ώρα να τερματιστεί η καταφατική δράση.Οι πολέμιοι πιστεύουν ότι η καταφατική δράση δημιουργήθηκε για να εξασφαλίσει δίκαιες πρακτικές εισδοχής για να φέρει την αλλαγή σε μια μακρά περίοδο φυλετικών διακρίσεων. Πιστεύουν ότι η πολιτική είναι ξεπερασμένη."

| Tools<br/><br/>Resources:<br/><br/>From astronomy to history,<br/><br/>we had an inside view of the 2017 eclipse.<br/><br/>total eclipse<br/><br/>Columbia, SC was one of the best places to experience America's first coast-to-coast<br/>total solar eclipse since 1918. At Carolina, we celebrated our community's front-row<br/>seat with a vast series of celestial exhibitions, expert discussions and scientific research.<br/><br/>At 2:41 p.m. on Aug. 21, the Columbia, SC area enjoyed a front-row seat to history<br/>with a 100 percent total eclipse viewing period of two minutes and 36 seconds. While<br/>partial eclipses are more common, August's total solar eclipse was a remarkable and<br/>rare event. In the days leading up to the great event and on the day of the eclipse,<br/>our campus teemed with students, visitors and guests. Not only did our visitors enjoy<br/>a view in the path of totality, they also gained insightful perspective from our university<br/>experts including astrophysicists, researchers, naturalists and artists.<br/><br/>Play video<br/><br/>Total Eclipse 2017: 6:01<br/><br/>A Wondrous Learning Experience<br/><br/>The total solar eclipse on Aug. 21 was a watershed moment for Carolina, Columbia and<br/>the United States. It was the first total solar eclipse in the continental U.S. since<br/>1979, and the first transcontinental total solar eclipse, in which the eclipse's path<br/>goes coast to coast, in 99 years.<br/><br/>For April Hiscox, associate professor in the Department of Geography, the eclipse<br/>enhanced her research of the Earth's near atmosphere, the layer that extends from earth's surface to about a half-mile high. For physics<br/>and astronomy professor Timir Datta, it was a moment for recreating a famous 1919 experiment that helped confirm Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. And for Adam<br/>Hartstone-Rose, associate professor in the School of Medicine and adjunct scientist<br/>at Riverbanks Zoo, it was an opportunity to study odd animal behavior.<br/><br/>Studio art professor and researcher Chris Robinson connected art and science through his<br/>unique Southern Lights laser installation, which debuted on Sat., Aug. 19. The large-scale installation, which will span the Congaree River near the Blossom Street Bridge, is planned for<br/>future long-term display so more visitors can enjoy the unique laser-beam experience.<br/><br/>An Epic Event Schedule<br/><br/>Being home to the longest period of total eclipse on the East Coast was significant.<br/>That's why, throughout the city, you could enjoy a galaxy of eclipse-related events<br/>in the days leading up to the main event. The University of South Carolina Columbia<br/>Campus hosted a number of free, public programs beginning on Aug. 17.<br/><br/>On Fri., Aug. 18, solar physicist Dr. Sarbani Basu, Department of Astronomy Chair at Yale University, discussed the history of solar<br/>eclipses and what humankind has learned from them in a public lecture.<br/><br/>On Sun., Aug. 20, visitors to campus took part in a series of free, 30-minute talks<br/>by USC faculty and visiting scholars Ramesh Kapoor, Gerardo Vazquez, James Overduin and Kristin Simunac.<br/><br/>Held at Swearingen Engineering Center, the series hosted experts who discussed the role of eclipses in science and society, and how eclipses have factored in myths<br/>and legends throughout history.<br/><br/>Visitors to Spirit Communications Park on eclipse day were invited to explore the Degrees of Health with UofSC at the iMAGINE STEM Festival. This full day of fun included interactive STEM exhibits (science, technology, engineering<br/>and math) from UofSC and other organizations. Tickets also included the 1:05 p.m.<br/>Columbia Fireflies vs. Rome Braves game and Total Eclipse of the Park.<br/><br/>For those who preferred to beat the heat and watch the eclipse inside, we offered<br/>live stream viewing of NASA TV's Eclipse Megacast in several areas across the Columbia Campus.<br/><br/>A variety of experts visited locations across campus to share how eclipses are woven<br/>into our science, culture, history and art. Allison Marsh, Steven Rodney, Michael Weisenburg, Scott White, Varsha Kulkarni, Nate Carnes and Zhenlong Li each hosted 20-minute public discussions leading up to the eclipse.<br/><br/>The Department of Physics and Astronomy operated 10 outdoor and 5 indoor viewing stations across campus with telescopes, activities and/or NASA live video streams. Viewers<br/>could choose their eclipse experience with access to expert discussions and telescopic technology<br/>or fun activities such as disc golf and family-friendly crafts.<br/><br/>USC's Naturalist-in-Residence Rudy Mancke visited viewers on the historic Horseshoe to share the nature of the solar eclipse,<br/>leading up to the 2.5 minutes of totality beginning at 2:41 pm.<br/><br/>After the sun fully re-emerged, the university hosted an Eclipse Reception for rising high school seniors and upcoming graduate students.<br/><br/>In the late afternoon, the Darla Moore School of Business hosted a free, public talk<br/>by Dr. Craig Roberts, a distinguished professor and senior physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, one<br/>of the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratories for science and engineering<br/>research. In his "Laying the God Particle to Rest" discussion, Dr. Roberts discussed Higgs Boson and why it cannot be used to identify<br/>the source of more than 98 percent of the universe's visible mass.<br/><br/>The big day finally came to a close at Williams Brice Stadium where visitors could<br/>enjoy the university's gridiron stars. An open practice of the 2017 Gamecock football team was the perfect ending to a phenomenal day.<br/><br/>Highlighting History<br/><br/>Campus visitors could mingle alongside eclipse experts and everyone near and far was invited to share in this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Viewers at our 15 on-campus<br/>viewing stations enjoyed access to eclipse-related experts and other educational opportunities<br/>while safely enjoying the solar eclipse. | Εργαλεία<br/><br/>Πόροι:<br/><br/>Από την αστρονομία στην ιστορία,<br/><br/>είχαμε μια εσωτερική άποψη της έκλειψης του 2017.<br/><br/>ολική έκλειψη<br/><br/>Κολούμπια, SC ήταν ένα από τα καλύτερα μέρη για να βιώσουν την πρώτη από ακτή σε ακτή ολική ηλιακή έκλειψη της Αμερικής από το 1918. Στην Καρολίνα, γιορτάσαμε την πρώτη θέση της κοινότητάς μας με μια τεράστια σειρά ουράνιων εκθέσεων, συζητήσεων εμπειρογνωμόνων και επιστημονικής έρευνας.<br/><br/>Στις 2:41 μ.μ. στις 21 Αυγούστου, η περιοχή Κολούμπια της SC απολάμβανε μια θέση πρώτης σειράς στην ιστορία με μια περίοδο προβολής ολικής έκλειψης 100 τοις εκατό δύο λεπτών και 36 δευτερολέπτων. Ενώ οι μερικές εκλείψεις είναι πιο συχνές, η ολική ηλιακή έκλειψη του Αυγούστου ήταν ένα αξιοσημείωτο και σπάνιο γεγονός. Τις ημέρες που προηγήθηκαν του μεγάλου γεγονότος και την ημέρα της έκλειψης, η πανεπιστημιούπολη μας ήταν γεμάτη με μαθητές, επισκέπτες και επισκέπτες. Οι επισκέπτες μας όχι μόνο απολάμβαναν μια άποψη στο μονοπάτι της ολότητας, αλλά απέκτησαν και διορατική προοπτική από τους πανεπιστημιακούς μας ειδικούς συμπεριλαμβανομένων αστροφυσικών, ερευνητών, φυσιοδίφες και καλλιτέχνες.<br/><br/>Αναπαραγωγή βίντεο<br/><br/>Συνολική Έκλειψη 2017: 6:01<br/><br/>Μια Θαυμαστή Μαθησιακή Εμπειρία<br/><br/>Η ολική έκλειψη ηλίου στις 21 Αυγούστου ήταν μια κρίσιμη στιγμή για την Καρολίνα, την Κολομβία και τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες.<br/>1979, και η πρώτη διηπειρωτική ολική ηλιακή έκλειψη, στην οποία το μονοπάτι της έκλειψης πηγαίνει από ακτή σε ακτή, σε 99 χρόνια.<br/><br/>Για τον Απρίλιο η Hiscox, αναπληρώτρια καθηγήτρια στο Τμήμα Γεωγραφίας, η έκλειψη ενίσχυσε την έρευνά της για την εγγύς ατμόσφαιρα της Γης, το στρώμα που εκτείνεται από την επιφάνεια της Γης σε ύψος περίπου μισού μιλίου. Για τον καθηγητή φυσικής και αστρονομίας Timir Datta, ήταν μια στιγμή για την αναδημιουργία ενός διάσημου πειράματος του 1919 που βοήθησε στην επιβεβαίωση της θεωρίας της γενικής σχετικότητας του Άλμπερτ Αϊνστάιν.<br/>Hartstone-Rose, αναπληρωτής καθηγητής στην Ιατρική Σχολή και επίκουρος επιστήμονας στο ζωολογικό κήπο του Riverbanks, ήταν μια ευκαιρία να μελετηθεί η παράξενη συμπεριφορά των ζώων.<br/><br/>Ο καθηγητής τέχνης στούντιο και ερευνητής Κρις Ρόμπινσον συνέδεσε την τέχνη και την επιστήμη μέσω της μοναδικής εγκατάστασης λέιζερ Southern Lights, η οποία έκανε το ντεμπούτο της στις 19 Αυγούστου. Η εγκατάσταση μεγάλης κλίμακας, η οποία θα εκτείνεται στον ποταμό Congaree κοντά στη γέφυρα της οδού Blossom, έχει προγραμματιστεί για μελλοντική μακροπρόθεσμη οθόνη, ώστε περισσότεροι επισκέπτες να μπορούν να απολαύσουν τη μοναδική εμπειρία λέιζερ-ακτίνων.<br/><br/>Ένα Επικό Πρόγραμμα Εκδηλώσεων<br/><br/>Το να είναι το σπίτι στη μεγαλύτερη περίοδο ολικής έκλειψης στην Ανατολική Ακτή ήταν σημαντικό.<br/>Γι' αυτό, σε όλη την πόλη, θα μπορούσατε να απολαύσετε ένα γαλαξία γεγονότων που σχετίζονται με την έκλειψη τις ημέρες που οδηγούν στο κύριο γεγονός.<br/>Το Campus φιλοξένησε μια σειρά από δωρεάν, δημόσια προγράμματα που ξεκίνησαν στις 17 Αυγούστου.<br/><br/>Στις 18 Αυγούστου, ο ηλιακός φυσικός Δρ. Σαρμπάνι Μπασού, Πρόεδρος του Τμήματος Αστρονομίας στο Πανεπιστήμιο Γέιλ, συζήτησε την ιστορία των ηλιακών εκλείψεων και τι έχει μάθει η ανθρωπότητα από αυτές σε μια δημόσια διάλεξη.<br/><br/>Στις 20 Αυγούστου, οι επισκέπτες της πανεπιστημιούπολης έλαβαν μέρος σε μια σειρά δωρεάν, 30 λεπτών συνομιλιών από καθηγητές του USC και επισκέπτες μελετητές Ramesh Kapoor, Gerardo Vazquez, James Overduin και Kristin Simunac.<br/><br/>Διεξήχθη στο Μηχανολογικό Κέντρο του Σβάρινγκεν, η σειρά φιλοξένησε ειδικούς που συζήτησαν το ρόλο των εκλείψεων στην επιστήμη και την κοινωνία, και το πώς οι εκλείψεις έχουν συντελεστεί σε μύθους και θρύλους σε όλη την ιστορία.<br/><br/>Οι επισκέπτες στο Spirit Communications Park την ημέρα της έκλειψης κλήθηκαν να εξερευνήσουν τα Degrees of Health με το UofSC στο iMAGINE STEM Festival. Αυτή η πλήρης ημέρα διασκέδασης περιελάμβανε διαδραστικά εκθέματα STEM (επιστήμη, τεχνολογία, μηχανική και μαθηματικά) από το UofSC και άλλους οργανισμούς. Τα εισιτήρια περιλάμβαναν επίσης το 1:05 μ.μ.<br/>Columbia Fireflies εναντίον Rome Braves παιχνίδι και Total Eclipse of the Park.<br/><br/>Για όσους προτιμούσαν να χτυπήσουν τη ζέστη και να παρακολουθήσουν την έκλειψη στο εσωτερικό, προσφέραμε ζωντανή προβολή ροής του Eclipse Megacast της NASA TV σε αρκετές περιοχές σε όλη την Πανεπιστημιούπολη της Κολούμπια.<br/><br/>Μια ποικιλία ειδικών επισκέφθηκε τοποθεσίες σε όλη την πανεπιστημιούπολη για να μοιραστεί το πώς οι εκλείψεις υφαίνονται στην επιστήμη, τον πολιτισμό, την ιστορία και την τέχνη μας. Οι Allison Marsh, Steven Rodney, Michael Weisenburg, Scott White, Varsha Kulkarni, Nate Carnes και Zhenlong Li έκαστος φιλοξένησαν 20λεπτες δημόσιες συζητήσεις που οδήγησαν στην έκλειψη.<br/><br/>Το Τμήμα Φυσικής και Αστρονομίας λειτουργούσε 10 υπαίθριους και 5 εσωτερικούς σταθμούς προβολής σε όλη την πανεπιστημιούπολη με τηλεσκόπια, δραστηριότητες και/ή ζωντανές ροές βίντεο της NASA. Οι θεατές μπορούσαν να επιλέξουν την εμπειρία τους από την έκλειψη με πρόσβαση σε συζητήσεις εμπειρογνωμόνων και τηλεσκοπική τεχνολογία ή διασκεδαστικές δραστηριότητες, όπως γκολφ δίσκων και φιλικά προς την οικογένεια χειροτεχνήματα.<br/><br/>Ο φυσιοδίφης του USC Rudy Mancke επισκέφθηκε τους θεατές στο ιστορικό Horseshoe για να μοιραστεί τη φύση της ηλιακής έκλειψης, οδηγώντας μέχρι τα 2,5 λεπτά της ολότητας ξεκινώντας στις 2:41 μ.μ..<br/><br/>Μετά την πλήρη επανεμφάνιση του ήλιου, το πανεπιστήμιο φιλοξένησε μια υποδοχή Eclipse για ανερχόμενους τελειόφοιτους λυκείου και επερχόμενους μεταπτυχιακούς φοιτητές.<br/><br/>Αργά το απόγευμα, το Darla Moore School of Business φιλοξένησε μια δωρεάν, δημόσια ομιλία του Δρ Craig Roberts, διακεκριμένου καθηγητή και ανώτερου φυσικού στο Εθνικό Εργαστήριο Argonne, ένα από τα εθνικά εργαστήρια του Υπουργείου Ενέργειας των ΗΠΑ για την έρευνα της επιστήμης και της μηχανικής.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Συνδυασμοί<br/><br/>Οι συνδυασμοί είναι άμυνες ενάντια σε μια γροθιά, χορογραφημένες απαντήσεις σε διαφορετικούς τύπους επιθέσεων. Έχουν πολλά ονόματα σε όλες τις πολεμικές τέχνες αλλά (κατά την εμπειρία μου) κάθε τέχνη έχει μια εκδοχή τους. Αυτό τους κάνει διαφορετικούς από τις μορφές επειδή υπάρχουν πολλές πολεμικές τέχνες που δεν έχουν μορφές. Γιατί να εξασκηθείτε σε μια συγκεκριμένη απάντηση όταν (στην πραγματικότητα) ο συγχρονισμός, το είδος της επίθεσης, το μέγεθος του επιτιθέμενου, και εκατό άλλοι παράγοντες θα το κάνουν έτσι ώστε να μην χρησιμοποιήσετε ποτέ ολόκληρη αυτή τη χορογραφημένη απάντηση; Και τέλος, πώς μπορούμε να εξασκηθούμε για μια πραγματική κατάσταση άμυνας και να αποφύγουμε τον τραυματισμό ταυτόχρονα;<br/><br/>Η καθολικότητα των συνδυασμών είναι εντυπωσιακή, το λιγότερο που μπορούμε να πούμε. Το στυλ μας του Kenpo karate έχει μια λίστα με 108 συνδυασμούς που μπορούμε να μάθουμε. (Οι περισσότεροι μαθητές μαθαίνουν μόνο 20-30 όμως) Στη βραζιλιάνικη Jiu-Jitsu περνάτε ολόκληρα μαθήματα εξασκώντας μπάρες και chokes, μαθαίνοντας κάθε λεπτότητα στην κίνηση ενώ ο σύντροφός σας προσφέρει λίγη έως καθόλου αντίσταση. Κάθε πυγμάχος έχει περάσει ώρες μπροστά από την τσάντα ή/και τον καθρέφτη ρίχνοντας τον ίδιο συνδυασμό γροθιών μέχρι το σώμα τους να κινηθεί μόνο του αντανακλαστικά. Οι συνδυασμοί είναι καθολικοί επειδή δεν έχουμε καλύτερο τρόπο να εισάγουμε την κίνηση και στη συνέχεια να εξασκούμε τις λεπτές θέσεις που απαιτούνται για να τις κάνουμε να λειτουργήσουν. Χτυπώντας ένα μικρό σημείο πίεσης μέσα από τα ρούχα παίρνει πολλή εξάσκηση, πιάνοντας μια μπάρα βραχίονα με έλεγχο απαιτεί ένα προσεκτικά τοποθετημένο ισχίο και μια ύπουλη εγκατάσταση, και ένας μεγάλος συνδυασμός είναι χρήσιμος μόνο αν μπορείτε μέσα από αυτό από μια ισορροπημένη και προστατευμένη θέση. Μπορείς να σκεφτείς έναν καλύτερο τρόπο για να αποκτήσεις αυτές τις ικανότητες;<br/><br/>Υπάρχουν πολλοί παράγοντες που καθορίζουν πώς ανταποκρίνεσαι σε μια επίθεση και αν σε έναν αγώνα πυγμαχίας ή σε έναν αγώνα, δεν έχω χρησιμοποιήσει ΠΟΤΕ έναν πλήρη συνδυασμό για την υπεράσπισή μου. Εξασκούμε αυτές τις χορογραφημένες απαντήσεις επειδή ο στόχος δεν είναι να τραβήξουμε το συνδυασμό 8 έξω κάθε φορά που θα δείτε μια γροθιά γάντζου αλλά να σας δείξουμε έναν τρόπο να το μπλοκάρουμε και στη συνέχεια έναν πιθανό τρόπο να το ακολουθήσετε. Ποτέ δεν επέλεξα να χρησιμοποιήσω το συνδυασμό 3 σε μια κατάσταση πραγματικότητας αλλά το μπλοκ είναι μία από τις go-to κινήσεις μου. Οι συνδυασμοί προσθέτουν εργαλεία στην εργαλειοθήκη που δεν διορθώνουν το αυτοκίνητο.<br/><br/>Η τελευταία ερώτηση είναι θέμα ασφάλειας. Αν εξασκούμαστε για χάρη της πραγματικότητας πρέπει να αντιγράψουμε την πραγματικότητα. Πώς προλαμβάνουμε τον τραυματισμό ενώ το κάνουμε αυτό; Όταν πρόκειται για την οικοδόμηση εμπιστοσύνης. Αρχίζουμε αργά και μαθαίνουμε να εμπιστευόμαστε ότι έχουμε τον έλεγχο πάνω στον εαυτό μας. Μαθαίνουμε να εμπιστευόμαστε και τους συνεργάτες μας. Σε περισσότερο χρόνο μαθαίνουμε να εμπιστευόμαστε τον έλεγχό μας πάνω στον σύντροφό μας και (λίγο πιο τρομακτικό) μαθαίνουμε να εμπιστευόμαστε τον έλεγχο του συντρόφου μας πάνω μας. Στο τέλος (με πολλή εξάσκηση) μπορείτε να κινηθείτε είναι πλήρης ταχύτητα, πετώντας το σύντροφό σας, και ρίχνονται χωρίς φόβο τραυματισμού.<br/><br/>Οι συνδυασμοί είναι συμπαντικοί για κάποιο λόγο· ασκούνται έτσι ώστε να μπορούν να τεμαχιστούν στα μέρη τους, και μένουμε ασφαλείς ξεκινώντας αργά και χτίζοντας εμπιστοσύνη. Όπως και με όλα τα άλλα στις πολεμικές τέχνες, οι συνδυασμοί έχουν πολλούς λόγους πίσω από την πρακτική και την εκτέλεσή τους. |
