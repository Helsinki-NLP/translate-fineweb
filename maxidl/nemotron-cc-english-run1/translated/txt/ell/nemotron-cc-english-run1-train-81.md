| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Τζόνσον υπέγραψε τον Νόμο για τα Δικαιώματα Ψήφου του 1965.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Σχεδόν πριν από έναν αιώνα, η 15η Τροποποίηση του Συντάγματος δήλωνε, "Το δικαίωμα των πολιτών των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών να ψηφίζουν δεν πρέπει να απορρίπτεται ή να συντομεύεται από τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες ή από οποιαδήποτε πολιτεία λόγω φυλής, χρώματος ή προηγούμενης κατάστασης υποτέλειας". Και σχεδόν έναν αιώνα πριν από αυτό, οι ιδρυτές του έθνους μας έθεσαν σε κίνηση το μεγάλο πείραμα της αμερικανικής δημοκρατίας δηλώνοντας ότι "όλοι οι άνθρωποι δημιουργούνται ίσοι".<br/><br/>Ο Νόμος για τα Δικαιώματα της Ψήφου του 1965 ήταν μια καθυστερημένη αναγνώριση ότι ακόμα και στην Αμερική, τα θεμελιώδη ιδανικά μας έχουν μικρή βαρύτητα αν δεν προστατεύονται από το κράτος δικαίου. Γι' αυτό και το Τμήμα 2 της 15ης Τροποποίησης παραχώρησε στο Κογκρέσο την «εξουσία να επιβάλει αυτό το άρθρο με την κατάλληλη νομοθεσία».<br/><br/>Και πράγματι, η κωδικοποιημένη γλώσσα του νόμου για τα δικαιώματα ψήφου ήταν σε θέση να επιτύχει αυτό που το Κογκρέσο της Ανασυγκρότησης και ο Τόμας Τζέφερσον δεν μπορούσαν. Ο Νόμος για τα Πολιτικά Δικαιώματα του 1964 και ο Νόμος για τα Δικαιώματα της Ψήφου -και το κίνημα των πολιτικών δικαιωμάτων από το οποίο προέκυψαν- χρησίμευσαν ως καταλύτης για μια δραματική αύξηση της ευκαιρίας για τους μαύρους Αμερικανούς να συμμετάσχουν στη δημοκρατική διαδικασία.<br/><br/>Για παράδειγμα, μόνο το 6,7 τοις εκατό των επιλέξιμων μαύρων Μισισίπι ήταν εγγεγραμμένοι για να ψηφίσουν από το 1962· μέχρι το 1969 ο αριθμός αυτός είχε φτάσει το 66,5 τοις εκατό.<br/><br/>Οι προστασίες που τέθηκαν σε εφαρμογή από τον Νόμο για τα Δικαιώματα της Ψήφου ήταν από καιρό καθυστερημένες όταν ψηφίστηκαν, αντιπροσωπευτικές του επίπονου αγώνα με τον οποίο επιτεύχθηκαν. Αλλά άστοχα, αυτές οι προστασίες είναι τώρα υπό επίθεση, θέτοντας σε κίνδυνο την πρόοδο που το έθνος μας εργάστηκε τόσο σκληρά για να επιτευχθεί.<br/><br/>Πέρυσι, στην υπόθεση Σέλμπι Κάουντι κατά Χόλντερ, το Ανώτατο Δικαστήριο των ΗΠΑ διέλυσε ένα βασικό στοιχείο του νόμου για τα δικαιώματα ψήφου που έδωσε τη δυνατότητα προηγούμενης ομοσπονδιακής αναθεώρησης για τη διασφάλιση της μη διάκρισης πριν τεθεί σε ισχύ οποιοσδήποτε νέος νόμος ψηφοφορίας.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Δυστυχώς, η απάντηση των ρεπουμπλικανών ηγετών ήταν να μην κάνουν τίποτα. Ο γερουσιαστής Τεντ Κρουζ και ο κυβερνήτης Ρικ Πέρι βγήκαν από το δρόμο τους για να επαινέσουν την απόφαση του Ανωτάτου Δικαστηρίου. Ο γερουσιαστής Ραντ Πολ απέρριψε τη συνεχιζόμενη αναγκαιότητα του νόμου για τα δικαιώματα ψήφου σημειώνοντας, "Έχουμε έναν Αφροαμερικανό πρόεδρο".<br/><br/>Ενώ η εκλογή του προέδρου Μπαράκ Ομπάμα ήταν πράγματι ένα ιστορικό ορόσημο, είναι επικίνδυνο να πιστεύουμε ότι μας απαλλάσσει από το να παραμείνουμε σε επαγρύπνηση ενάντια στις παρατεταμένες συνέπειες του παρελθόντος του έθνους μας. Η βιασύνη με την οποία τα κράτη έχουν κινηθεί για να θεσπίσουν περιορισμούς ψηφοφορίας είναι η επιβεβαίωση ότι οι προστασίες που τίθενται σε εφαρμογή από την Ενότητα 4 εξακολουθούν να είναι απαραίτητες.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Οι Ρεπουμπλικάνοι κυβερνήτες έχουν υπογράψει αυστηρούς περιορισμούς φωτο-αναγνώρισης στο νόμο ως τη λύση σε ένα ουσιαστικά ανύπαρκτο πρόβλημα μίμησης ψηφοφόρων, βλάπτοντας δυσανάλογα τις γυναίκες, τους νέους, τις εργαζόμενες οικογένειες και την αφροαμερικανική κοινότητα. Είναι ανειλικρινής για Ρεπουμπλικάνους όπως ο Πολ να αναζητούν τις ψήφους αυτών των κοινοτήτων όταν πιστεύουν ότι "δεν υπάρχει τίποτα το κακό με" την τοποθέτηση περιορισμών που καθιστούν δυσκολότερο για αυτές τις εκλογικές περιφέρειες να ψηφίσουν.<br/><br/>Οι Ρεπουμπλικάνοι επιδίωξαν επίσης να περιορίσουν τις περιόδους πρόωρης ψήφου, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της Κυριακής πριν από την Ημέρα των Εκλογών, όταν οι Αφροαμερικανικές εκκλησίες είχαν μεγάλη επιτυχία με το Souls στα προγράμματα των Δημοσκοπήσεων.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Αυτοί οι περιορισμοί αντιπροσωπεύουν μια σκληρή προσπάθεια από τους Ρεπουμπλικάνους να κάνουν πιο δύσκολη την ψηφοφορία, με βάση στενούς, βραχυπρόθεσμους πολιτικούς υπολογισμούς ότι οι Ρεπουμπλικάνοι μπορούν να κερδίσουν τις εκλογές συρρικνώνοντας το μέγεθος του εκλογικού σώματος.<br/><br/>Οι Δημοκρατικοί έχουν μια πολύ διαφορετική αποστολή όσον αφορά την ψηφοφορία: να διασφαλίσουν ότι κάθε επιλέξιμος ψηφοφόρος μπορεί να εγγραφεί, ότι κάθε εγγεγραμμένος ψηφοφόρος μπορεί να ψηφίσει και ότι κάθε ψήφος υπολογίζεται με ακρίβεια.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Το Πρόγραμμα Επέκτασης Ψηφοφόρων της Δημοκρατικής Εθνικής Επιτροπής αντανακλά την πεποίθησή μας ότι η μεγαλύτερη συμμετοχή των ψηφοφόρων ενισχύει το έθνος μας και τη δημοκρατία μας. Θα συνεχίσουμε να χρησιμοποιούμε τις απαράμιλλες θεσμικές γνώσεις μας για την προστασία των δικαιωμάτων ψήφου ενάντια στη νομοθεσία και τις τακτικές που θα επιχειρούσαν να καταστείλουν την ψηφοφορία. Και επειδή η καλύτερη άμυνα είναι μια καλή επίθεση, εργαζόμαστε επίσης για να επεκτείνουμε την ψηφοφορία αναπτύσσοντας την τεχνολογία μας και τους πόρους δεδομένων για να καταχωρήσουμε νέους ψηφοφόρους.<br/><br/>Σε αυτή την επέτειο, ένας από τους καλύτερους τρόπους που μπορούμε να τιμήσουμε όσους αγωνίστηκαν -και σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις έδωσαν την ίδια τους τη ζωή- για το πέρασμα της νομοθεσίας είναι για τους Ρεπουμπλικάνους στο Κογκρέσο να ενωθούν με τους Δημοκρατικούς στην ψήφιση του νόμου για την τροποποίηση των δικαιωμάτων ψήφου για να αποκαταστήσουν την υπόσχεση του νόμου για τα δικαιώματα ψήφου του 1965.<br/><br/>Διαφήμιση<br/><br/>Η Debbie Wasserman Schultz, μια Δημοκρατική, εκπροσωπεί την 23η Συνεδριακή Περιφέρεια της Φλόριντα στο Κογκρέσο των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Ε&Α: Ο ειδικός διασφάλισης του Βατικανού Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 Ιουνίου 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ.

Χανς Ζόλνερ SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Η κατανόησή μου, αφού επισκέφθηκα περίπου 50 χώρες σε πέντε ή έξι ηπείρους, είναι ότι η Εκκλησία αρχίζει πραγματικά να κινείται τα τελευταία δύο χρόνια σχετικά με το ζήτημα της απονομής δικαιοσύνης στα θύματα, της ακρόασής τους και να κάνει οτιδήποτε μπορεί να γίνει όσον αφορά τη διασφάλιση.<br/><br/>Ήμουν με τους Ιησουίτες Επαρχιακούς από όλη την Αφρική στα τέλη Απριλίου, και ο Πρόεδρος της Ιησουιτικής Βοήθειας της Αφρικής και της Μαδαγασκάρης είναι πολύ αφοσιωμένος και αφοσιωμένος σε αυτό. Έχει καταστρώσει ένα διεξοδικό σχέδιο δράσης για το σχηματισμό και για την εισαγωγή κατευθυντήριων γραμμών σε όλη τη χώρα. Είναι μια πολύ στοχαστική και πολύ σκόπιμη προσπάθεια να γίνει οτιδήποτε μπορεί να γίνει για να εμπλακούν προληπτικά ως Ιησουίτες στην Αφρική - σε μια ήπειρο όπου μέχρι πριν από λίγα χρόνια όλα αυτά ήταν μια ξένη γλώσσα.<br/><br/>Μία από τις προκλήσεις της προσπάθειας ανάπτυξης αυτής της παγκόσμιας προσέγγισης είναι ότι έχετε να κάνετε με τόσους πολλούς πολιτισμούς, και τόσες πολλές διαφορετικές αντιλήψεις. Πώς το φέρνεις αυτό κοντά και προσπαθείς να παρέχεις εκπαίδευση και υποστήριξη στις θρησκευτικές κοινότητες που αντιμετωπίζουν αυτά τα ζητήματα;<br/><br/>Αυτό είναι ένα από τα μεγάλα ερωτήματα που έχουμε, νομίζω ότι αυτό που μπορώ να κάνω είναι να τονώσω τη συζήτηση, να τονώσω τον προβληματισμό και να προετοιμάσω τους ανθρώπους όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερο, ώστε να μπορούν να κάνουν τις βάσεις.<br/><br/>Το Κέντρο Προστασίας του Παιδιού στο Γρηγοριανό Πανεπιστήμιο δεν προσποιείται ότι έχει την απάντηση σε κάθε ερώτηση. Όχι μόνο επειδή δεν γνωρίζουμε τα συγκεκριμένα πλαίσια - μπορεί να γνωρίζουμε μερικά από αυτά, αλλά μιλάμε για χιλιάδες πολιτισμούς, μιλάμε για εκατοντάδες γλώσσες, μιλάμε για πολύ διαφορετικά νομικά υπόβαθρα. Ποικίλλει ακόμη και μερικές φορές μέσα σε μία χώρα, όπως η Αυστραλία όπου έχετε πολιτείες εντός της Κοινοπολιτείας της Αυστραλίας που έχουν διαφορετικούς νόμους από άλλες πολιτείες.<br/><br/>Είμαι κάποιος που προσπαθεί να αποσπάσει και να τονώσει τη συζήτηση και τον προβληματισμό.<br/><br/>Αναφέρατε την ανάγκη να ακούσετε και να υποστηρίξετε τα θύματα στο άκουσμα. Προφανώς είχαμε τη Βασιλική Επιτροπή εδώ στην Αυστραλία, αλλά ποιοι είναι μερικοί από τους άλλους τρόπους που είδατε ότι οι φωνές των θυμάτων υποστηρίζονται σε όλο τον κόσμο;<br/><br/>Στη Γαλλία υπάρχει μία επισκοπή που έχει καθιερώσει αυτό που ονομάζουν «Ακουστικό Χώρο». Εκεί, τα θύματα μπορούν να βγουν μπροστά και να εκφραστούν. Ο επίσκοπος είναι παρών. Είναι ένας ανοιχτός χώρος στον οποίο οι άνθρωποι που έχουν πληγωθεί τρομερά είναι ελεύθεροι τουλάχιστον να εκφράσουν αυτό που θέλουν να ζητήσουν από την ηγεσία της Εκκλησίας κ.λπ.<br/><br/>Υπάρχουν και άλλα μέρη στις ΗΠΑ ή σε άλλες χώρες όπου τα θύματα έχουν προσκληθεί από επισκοπές, από Επαρχίες, από την ηγεσία της Εκκλησίας, για να παρουσιαστούν. Οφείλω να πω ότι γενικά πιστεύω ότι υπάρχει καλή θέληση, και υπάρχουν περισσότεροι άνθρωποι σαν τους επισκόπους και τους επαρχιώτες που ακούν τα θύματα απ' ό,τι γνωρίζουμε. Αλλά δεν υπάρχει κανένα πρότυπο που να δίνει στα θύματα όχι μόνο το χώρο να εκφράζονται και να ακούγονται, αλλά και να ασχολούνται ενεργά με την ανάπτυξη της Εκκλησίας.<br/><br/>Όσον αφορά τη δημιουργία χώρων για την υποστήριξη των θυμάτων, ποια είναι μερικά από τα πράγματα που έχετε δει που θα μπορούσαν πραγματικά να βοηθήσουν - και που θα μπορούσαμε να εξετάσουμε εδώ στην Αυστραλία;<br/><br/>Ένα από τα κύρια σημεία που εγείρουν πολλά θύματα είναι, 'Δεν μπορούμε να έχουμε, μέσα σε ενοριακούς χώρους, μέσα σε σχολικές ρυθμίσεις, μια τακτική συζήτηση που συνεχίζεται που περιλαμβάνει επιζώντες κακοποίησης ως τακτικά μέλη μιας επιτροπής, μιας επιτροπής, ενός ηχητικού συμβουλίου, μιας ομάδας ανατροφοδότησης ή κάτι τέτοιο;' Έτσι ώστε αυτή η φωνή να μην εισάγεται μόνο σε μια συγκεκριμένη περίσταση, ή όπου ένα άτομο αισθάνεται ότι βρίσκεται σε ένα σημείο για να μπορεί να μιλήσει γι' αυτήν, αλλά [ακούγεται] σε τακτική βάση – να οικοδομεί αυτή τη φωνή μέσα στο σύστημα.<br/><br/>Αυτό θα βοηθήσει όλους μας. " βοήθεια θα βοηθήσει τους επιζώντες και τα θύματα, επειδή θα αισθάνονται ευπρόσδεκτοι και θα εκτιμώνται στη συγκεκριμένη εμπειρία, και στις συγκεκριμένες προκλήσεις της ζωής, που πέρασαν. Δεύτερον, θα βοηθήσει την κοινότητα γενικότερα, διότι μπορούμε τουλάχιστον να κάνουμε τους εαυτούς μας όλο και πιο ευαίσθητους σε αυτό που είναι οι ανησυχίες και οι συγκεκριμένες ανάγκες των επιζώντων - που μπορούν επίσης να μιλήσουν για τις ανάγκες των νέων.<br/><br/>Μ: Έχουμε ισχυρές ομάδες επιζώντων εδώ στην Αυστραλία που μπόρεσαν να υποστηρίξουν ο ένας τον άλλον μέσω αυτής της διαδικασίας. Αλλά αυτό που λέτε είναι ότι χρειαζόμαστε κάποιο τρόπο υποστήριξης αυτών των ομάδων, και υποστήριξης αυτών των ανθρώπων, μέσω των δικών μας θεσμών επίσης;<br/><br/>Και νομίζω ότι πρέπει να είμαστε δημιουργικοί.Θα λειτουργήσει για ένα σχολείο και μία ενορία και μία επισκοπή με έναν τρόπο, και για άλλους με διαφορετικό τρόπο. Επειδή οι επιζώντες με τους οποίους βρίσκομαι σε συνεχή επαφή, έχουν αρκετά παρόμοια αιτήματα, και παρόμοιες εμπειρίες σε σχέση με το να είναι ευπρόσδεκτοι στην Εκκλησία ή όχι – να αισθάνονται πεταμένοι ή να απορρίπτονται. Αλλά έχουν επίσης μεταξύ τους αρκετά διαφορετικές προσδοκίες.Έτσι έμαθα ότι πρέπει επίσης να είστε πολύ επιφυλακτικοί στο να αποδεχτείτε τις διαφορές σε αυτό που αυτή η συγκεκριμένη ομάδα, ή αυτός ο συγκεκριμένος επιζών, θέλει, ζητά και χρειάζεται.<br/><br/>Μ: Οι επιζώντες μιλούν για την επιθυμία να ακουστούν και να αναγνωριστούν οι ιστορίες τους. Είχαμε την Βασιλική Επιτροπή εδώ στην Αυστραλία, η οποία παρείχε μια ανεξάρτητη διαδικασία όπου τα θύματα θα μπορούσαν να παρουσιαστούν. Υπάρχει ανάγκη για κάτι τέτοιο από την άποψη μιας διαδικασίας αλήθειας, δικαιοσύνης και συμφιλίωσης για την Εκκλησία διεθνώς;<br/><br/>Η: Ναι, νομίζω ότι υπάρχει ανάγκη για κάτι τέτοιο διεθνώς.Αλλά νομίζω ότι πρώτα κάθε τοπική εκκλησία πρέπει να κάνει τη δική της εργασία. Δεν βλέπω να συμβαίνει πολύ σύντομα κάποια τέτοια σύνοδος ή επιτροπή να συσταθεί για να ερευνήσει αυτή την περιοχή για όλη την Εκκλησία. Η Εκκλησία έχει μέλη 1,3 δισεκατομμύρια ανθρώπους, και είναι παρούσα σε 190 χώρες, με κάθε είδους διαφορές στις προσδοκίες που αφορούν την ψυχολογική, πνευματική και οικονομική υποστήριξη.<br/><br/>Υπάρχει ένα πράγμα που έχω συναντήσει με συνέπεια στην επικοινωνία, τη συνεργασία και την ακρόαση των θυμάτων, και αυτό είναι ότι θέλουν να εισακουστούν. Έτσι, αν υπήρχε η αίσθηση ότι τα θύματα ακούγονταν συνεχώς - στη Ρώμη και αλλού - νομίζω ότι αυτό θα έδινε μεγάλη ανακούφιση σε πολλά θύματα.<br/><br/>Νομίζω ότι η ανησυχία του [Πάπα Φραγκίσκου], ειδικά όσον αφορά την ερώτησή σας, είναι ότι οι τοπικές εκκλησίες κάνουν ό,τι μπορούν για να εισακουστούν τα θύματα στη συγκεκριμένη χώρα. Έχω μια λίστα με ανθρώπους που θέλουν να μιλήσουν απευθείας στον Άγιο Πατέρα, και σωματικά είναι αδύνατο. Ήμουν εκεί το 2014 για να μεταφράσω για δύο Γερμανούς επιζώντες που επιλέχθηκαν με δύο Ιρλανδούς και δύο Άγγλους επιζώντες όταν έλαβε τους έξι από αυτούς στο σπίτι. Πήρε όλο το πρωί ακούγοντάς τους ο ένας μετά τον άλλο. Για τον καθένα, ήταν εκεί για 40 με 45 λεπτά, αν το έκανε αυτό για κάθε επιζώντα που δεν μπορούσε να κοιμηθεί πια.<br/><br/>Το παράδειγμά του είναι η μοντελοποίηση για ολόκληρη την Καθολική Εκκλησία του τρόπου με τον οποίο τα θύματα και οι επιζώντες γίνονται δεκτά, καλωσορίζονται και ακούγονται. Νομίζω ότι αν οι επίσκοποι και οι επαρχιώτες σε αυτόν τον κόσμο, σε όλες τις χώρες, ακολουθούσαν το παράδειγμά του, πολλοί επιζώντες θα το εκτιμούσαν πραγματικά αυτό.<br/><br/>Ο Αρχιεπίσκοπος Diarmud Martin αναφέρθηκε πρόσφατα λίγο πριν την Παγκόσμια Συνάντηση των Οικογενειών, σχετικά με την Ποντιφική Επιτροπή, λέγοντας ότι είναι πολύ μικρή καθώς αυτή τη στιγμή έχει συσταθεί για να επιτύχει αυτό που χρειάζεται για να επιτευχθεί. Χρειάζεται η Εκκλησία να βάζει περισσότερους πόρους στον τρόπο με τον οποίο επιβλέπει αυτά τα θέματα;<br/><br/>Αυτή τη στιγμή είμαστε 16 μέλη από όλες τις ηπείρους, και τις μεγάλες γλωσσικές ομάδες. Αντιπροσωπεύουμε μια ποικιλία επιστημονικών κλάδων και επαγγελμάτων, και ο σκοπός της επιτροπής - όπως τα καταστατικά που μόλις έχουν εκδοθεί - είναι να παρέχει συμβουλές στον Άγιο Πατέρα.<br/><br/>Μια κοινή παρανόηση σχετικά με την επιτροπή είναι πρώτα ότι ασχολούμαστε με υποθέσεις ισχυρισμών. Δεν έχουμε καμία δικαστική ή διοικητική εξουσία σε ό,τι αφορά τις υποθέσεις, διότι όταν πρόκειται για καταγγελίες κατάχρησης ορίζονται τα δικαστήρια και η διαδικασία.<br/><br/>Μια δεύτερη παρανόηση είναι ότι προωθούμε, άμεσα, τα πράγματα στο έδαφος. Ο πρώτος και κυριότερος στόχος μας είναι να συμβουλεύουμε τον Άγιο Πατέρα σε θέματα.<br/><br/>Έτσι, από τη δική μου άποψη, ναι, πρέπει να επενδύσουμε περισσότερο. Πρέπει όμως να επενδύσουμε περισσότερο σε τοπικό επίπεδο, και πρέπει να διασφαλίσουμε ότι οι προτάσεις της Ποντιφικής Επιτροπής θα διαβιβαστούν στον Άγιο Πατέρα -κάτι που κανονικά κάνει ο Πρόεδρος- και στη συνέχεια υπάρχει μια διαδικασία παρακολούθησης που αντανακλά αυτό που δώσαμε ως συμβουλή μας.<br/><br/>Στην Αυστραλία, η Catholic Professional Standards Limited επιβλέπει την απάντηση της Εκκλησίας και παρέχει κατευθυντήριες γραμμές και υποστήριξη για τη διασφάλιση ότι όλα τα ιδρύματα στην Εκκλησία είναι ιδρύματα ασφαλή για τα παιδιά. Υπάρχει ανάγκη κάποιου είδους οργανωτικής υποστήριξης από τη Ρώμη για εκείνους τους επισκόπους και τις επισκοπές που αγωνίζονται να σχηματίσουν αυτούς τους θεσμούς και να παράσχουν προστασία σε εκείνες τις επισκοπές;<br/><br/>Νομίζω ότι τελικά η επιτροπή θα αναπτυχθεί σε αυτή τη γραμμή. " διαδικασία πρόσληψης εμπειρογνωμόνων σε αυτούς τους τομείς βρίσκεται τώρα στη διαδικασία.<br/><br/>Νομίζω ότι η Εκκλησία πρέπει να καταλάβει ότι οι τοπικές εκκλησίες μπορούν να μάθουν η μία από την άλλη αμοιβαία. Και η κατανόησή μου ήταν πάντα -και νομίζω ότι ο Άγιος Πατέρας μας υπενθύμισε- ότι η Εκκλησία δεν θα λειτουργήσει ως συγκεντρωτική εταιρεία. Δεν λειτουργεί έτσι, αποτελεσματικά. Κάθε επίσκοπος, κάθε σύνοδος επισκόπων, έχει, σε κάποιο βαθμό, τη ζωή του από μόνη της. Αυτό που πρέπει να μάθουμε περισσότερο είναι να ανοίγουμε διαύλους αμοιβαίας επικοινωνίας.<br/><br/>Ως ιερέας και ψυχολόγος, και ως κάποιος που έχει γνωρίσει και συνεργαστεί με επιζώντες, ποιες είναι οι σκέψεις σας για αυτό το θέμα;<br/><br/>Νομίζω ότι το ερώτημα από πού προέρχεται η κακοποίηση είναι το πιο σημαντικό, και ο Πάπας το έχει απευθύνει αυτό στην επιστολή του προς το λαό του Θεού που δημοσιεύθηκε στις 20 Αυγούστου. Λέει στην πρώτη παράγραφο, και το επαναλαμβάνει ξανά και ξανά, ότι το ζήτημα της σεξουαλικής κακοποίησης συνδέεται πάντα - ή σχεδόν πάντα συνδέεται - όχι μόνο με το ζήτημα της κατάχρησης εξουσίας, αλλά και με την κατάχρηση συνείδησης.<br/><br/>Έτσι, το πραγματικό θεμελιώδες ζήτημα της κακοποίησης είναι πολύ πιο περίπλοκο από το απλό ζήτημα της σεξουαλικότητας - είτε ετεροφυλόφιλος είτε ομοφυλόφιλος. Είναι θέμα εξουσίας, και εκεί πρέπει πραγματικά να εργαστούμε πάνω στο ερώτημα πώς καταλαβαίνουμε την ιεροσύνη, πώς να κατανοήσουμε την επισκοπή, πώς καταλαβαίνουμε και ζούμε τα υπουργεία μας; Ποια είναι τα όρια;<br/><br/>Γι' αυτό είμαι πολύ χαρούμενος που η επαρχία των Ιησουιτών στην Αυστραλία καθιερώνει έναν Κώδικα Δεοντολογίας γιατί δεν μιλάμε μόνο για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ανηλίκων. Μιλάμε για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ενηλίκων, και μιλάμε για κακοποίηση με άλλους τρόπους - όπως η κατάχρηση της συνείδησης, όπου υπαγορεύετε σε κάποιον αυτό που σκέφτεστε, ή παριστάνετε ότι γνωρίζετε από τον Θεό, και μπορείτε να πείτε σε ένα άλλο άτομο, "Πρέπει να το κάνετε αυτό", ενάντια στη συνείδηση αυτού του ατόμου.<br/><br/>Πολλοί άνθρωποι πιστεύουν ότι η αγαμία παράγει κακοποίηση. Όπως λέω πάντα, η αγαμία ως τέτοια δεν είναι αιτία για κατάχρηση - διαφορετικά πώς μπορούμε να εξηγήσουμε ότι το 99,9 τοις εκατό όλων των κακοποιών δεν ζουν άγαμη ζωή, και πώς μπορούμε να εξηγήσουμε ότι το 95 ή 96 τοις εκατό όλων των ιερέων δεν κάνουν κατάχρηση ανηλίκων; Αλλά, η αγαμία, ή ένας όρκος αγνότητας, που δεν είναι πραγματικά ολοκληρωμένος, που δεν βιώνεται πραγματικά σωστά - ναι, που παράγει ένα πρόβλημα. Μερικές φορές οι άνθρωποι παίρνουν το ποτό, μερικές φορές παίρνουν τα τυχερά παιχνίδια, και μερικές φορές παίρνουν το σεξουαλικό παράπτωμα, με τους ενήλικες και με τους ανηλίκους.<br/><br/>Το πραγματικό ερώτημα σχετικά με αυτό είναι πώς αντιμετωπίζουμε την έννοια της θρησκευτικής πνευματικής δύναμης με την οποία επενδύονται ιερείς και επίσκοποι; Πώς μπορεί η θεολογία να μας βοηθήσει να κατανοήσουμε, και ίσως πώς μπορεί η κοινωνιολογία, η ψυχολογία, ή η διοίκηση επιχειρήσεων να μας βοηθήσει να καθορίσουμε τα όρια της εξουσίας, και την αναγκαιότητα να διατηρήσουμε τα όριά σας |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Δεν εκπλήσσομαι από αυτή την αναντιστοιχία. στην πραγματικότητα, θα έφτανα μέχρι το σημείο να πω ότι αυτό δεν είναι κάτι που θα αλλάξει ποτέ, ούτε θα πρέπει να είμαστε όλοι στον ατμό για να το αλλάξουμε. Σε 10 χρόνια, θα έχουμε ακόμα αιμορραγικό άκρο, πολύπλοκα αντικείμενα στη λίστα με τις μεγαλύτερες ανησυχίες, και τα πράγματα που τελικά θα κάνουμε για να κατανοήσουμε θα είναι τα κύρια μέρη των δαπανών μας.<br/><br/>Τώρα, ο Gunnar και ο Andy έχουν και οι δύο εξαιρετικούς πόντους, ειδικά για τις ομάδες πληροφορικής που βλέπουν προβλήματα πληροφορικής και τα λύνουν με λύσεις πληροφορικής. στην πραγματικότητα, είμαι θετικός ότι οι πόντοι τους κατέχουν αξία.<br/><br/>Αλλά νομίζω ότι υπάρχουν και άλλες ιδέες που υπερισχύουν αυτών (σκέφτηκα στα blogs τους γι' αυτό, και αργότερα αποφάσισα ότι θα έπρεπε απλά να κάνω blog εδώ). Αυτές οι 3 κορυφαίες ανησυχίες είναι αιμορραγικά νέες έτσι ώστε:<br/><br/>Φοβόμαστε νέα πράγματα επειδή δεν τα καταλαβαίνουμε, ή δεν τα καταλαβαίνουμε επειδή είναι καινούρια.<br/><br/>Είναι πολύ νέα για να έχουμε σταθερές προσεγγίσεις για να τα χειριστούμε.<br/><br/>Είναι πολύ νέα για να ξέρουμε αν πρέπει να ανησυχούμε ή όχι! έχουμε την τάση να αψηφούμε την παρανοική/ανησυχητική, κάτι που είναι καλό!<br/><br/>Μπορώ να αγοράσω ένα κουτί ή κάποιο λογισμικό που να παρέχει "cloud security" ή "social media security?"<br/><br/>Είναι τόσο νέα που η επιχείρηση δεν ξέρει καν πώς να τα χρησιμοποιήσει ή τι θέλουν από αυτά, πόσο μάλλον πώς μπορούμε να τα ασφαλίσουμε ενώ ακόμα συναντούμε ή τουλάχιστον να μην ποδοπατούμε όλες τις ανάγκες της επιχείρησης. Αν η επιχείρηση δεν ξέρει καν πώς να τα χρησιμοποιήσει ακόμα, δεν είμαι σίγουρος ότι η ασφάλεια είναι σε θέση να καθοδηγήσει αυτή τη χρήση με ασφάλεια.<br/><br/>Θα πρέπει επίσης να αναφερθεί ότι αυτά τα νέα πράγματα ωθούνται σε μεγάλο βαθμό μέσω της consumerland και στην επιχείρηση, με την πληροφορική ως ένα είδος, "Ω ναι," σκέψης. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth είναι όλες οι απαντήσεις της πληροφορικής σε τυπικά θέματα πληροφορικής. Φυσικά υπάρχει μια διαφορά εκεί. Είναι επίσης πολύ υποκειμενικά θέματα, σε αντίθεση με πολύ αντικειμενικά αντικείμενα όπως τείχη προστασίας, γνωστά κακόβουλα bits, συμπεριφορές, υπογραφές, θύρες. Οι επιχειρήσεις παρουσιάζουν πολύ περίπλοκα θέματα που συχνά εμπλέκουν ανθρώπους (που δεν μπορούμε να μπαλώσουμε) και που συχνά δεν ταιριάζουν ωραία στους κανόνες κουβέρτας. Ακόμη και αν απομακρυνθούμε από τις τεχνικές λύσεις και αφιερώσουμε το χρόνο μας στην επίλυση αυτών των προβλημάτων, δεν πρόκειται να λυθούν τακτοποιημένα. Ομοίως, όταν έρχεται η ώθηση στο φτυάρι, μπορείτε να έχετε και να πετυχαίνετε στόχους με τείχη προστασίας; Μπορείτε να δείξετε βελτίωση; Όλα αυτά πηγάζουν από την μάλλον υποκειμενική μη τεχνική πλευρά αυτών των ζητημάτων. Είδος της διαφοράς μεταξύ της κάρτας αναφοράς ενός παιδιού και της ανατροφοδότησης που λαμβάνετε από ένα συνέδριο γονέων-καθηγητών. Αν έχετε ένα παιδί, με ποιο από τα δύο θα είχατε την τάση να διαφωνείτε περισσότερο ή να μην πιστεύετε απαραίτητα; (Η απάντηση είναι η υποκειμενική!)<br/><br/>Θα μπορούσε να ειπωθεί ότι αυτή είναι η φυσική εξέλιξη της ασφάλειας και της τεχνολογίας: από την ενίσχυση των τεχνικών ελέγχων μέχρι τη μετακίνηση της στοίβας προς τη συμπεριφορά και τους ανθρώπους. Σίγουρα, αυτές οι 3 κορυφαίες ανησυχίες μπορούν να ειπωθούν για να χτυπήσουν μέσω των firewalls και των τμημάτων δικτύου, αλλά αυτή είναι η φύση αυτών των πραγμάτων (τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης "χτυπούν" μέσω ενός τείχους προστασίας είναι πολύ διαφορετικά από εμένα που χτυπάω μέσω μιας σύνδεσης SSH για να γεφυρώσω το οικιακό μου δίκτυο· τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης είναι παρόμοια με τον *τρόπο* που χρησιμοποιώ τη σύνδεση μου SSH αφού το κράτημα έχει ήδη τρυπηθεί επειδή είναι απαραίτητο· δηλαδή τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης είναι ο τρόπος 80) χρησιμοποιείται η θύρα.<br/><br/>Βασικά, όλες οι ενδείξεις δείχνουν να μην εκπλήσσονται από αυτή τη διχοτόμηση. και δεν νομίζω ότι αυτό είναι κάποια περαιτέρω ένδειξη ότι η πληροφορική/ασφάλεια το κάνει λάθος, ή δεν ευθυγραμμίζεται σωστά με τις επιχειρήσεις, ή έχει ένα τεχνικό υπόβαθρο σκοτεινός-διακομιστής-δωμάτιο. Δεν λέω ότι κάνουμε τα πράγματα σωστά ή είμαστε σωστά ευθυγραμμισμένοι, αλλά τα παραπάνω δεν είναι καλό επιχείρημα για να υποστηρίξουμε τη θεωρία αυτών των ελλείψεων.<br/><br/>Τώρα για ένα πραγματικά μεγάλο άλμα. Θα ήθελα η τρέχουσα αύξηση του mobile computing να είναι τόσο μεγάλη όσο η εισαγωγή των υπολογιστών στην επιχείρηση και αργότερα το PC/Internet στην επιχείρηση. Τώρα, δεν ήμουν εκεί όταν συνέβη το πρώτο, ούτε ήμουν στη βιομηχανία όταν η επανάσταση των προσωπικών υπολογιστών σάρωσε τις επιχειρήσεις, αλλά θα στοιχημάτιζα ότι αυτή είναι η πιο κοντινή σύγκριση μέχρι στιγμής. Αυτά είναι αναθεματισμένα νέα και είναι μεγάλες αλλαγές πέρα από το να φέρνουν μόνο Macs ή νέο λογισμικό ή κάποια νέα επιχειρηματική διαδικασία. |
