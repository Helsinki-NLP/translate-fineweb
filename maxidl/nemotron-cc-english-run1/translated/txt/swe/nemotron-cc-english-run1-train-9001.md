| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Till exempel, artikel VI, klausul 2 i den amerikanska konstitutionen har bestämmelserna att "alla fördrag ... skall vara den högsta lagen i landet." Även om det är uppenbart att fördrag på egen hand inte har samma effekt som federala lagar. I själva verket blir de bara operativa när dessa bestämmelser träder i kraft som federal lag med senat och presidentgodkännande. Även om detta är praxis, är det en allmänt accepterad princip i internationell rätt att vissa fördrag har en bindande effekt på länder. Fördraget måste uppfylla kravet på att vara ett självverkställande fördrag för att påverka landet utan någon motsvarande inhemsk lagstiftare direkt.<br/><br/>Detta väcker frågan om vilket fördrag som kommer att betecknas som "självutförande" och vilka som inte kommer att göra det?<br/><br/>Huruvida ett fördrag är ett självutförande fördrag eller inte avgörs av nationella domare från fall till fall (Buergenthal, 1992). För att förstå detta kommer papperet först att titta på de två typerna av teorier som följs av länder om arten av fördrag som gäller för nationell rätt. Dessa två teorier är monism och dualism. De ser i grunden ramen för nationell och internationell rätt som en enda hierarki respektive två separata hierarkier (Wildhaber, 1971). Länder som följer monism anser att vissa fördrag omedelbart är bindande och omedelbart har en effekt på landet. När fördraget har ratificerats kan det åberopas i nationella domstolar och anses vara en del av landets lag. Länder som följer dualismen anser att ett fördrag inte påverkar den nationella lagstiftningen förrän det har förstärkts av en lagstiftande församling som antagits i parlamentet. Ett exempel på dualism är hur Europeiska konventionen om de mänskliga rättigheterna blev operativ i Storbritannien efter att ha antagit lagen om mänskliga rättigheter 1998 i deras parlament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>Folkrätten är mångskiftande, och det är också de typer av förfaranden som olika länder följer för att acceptera fördrag. Vissa länder har till och med olika behandling av internationell fördragsrätt och sedvanerätt. Vissa internationella organisationer som Europeiska unionen påverkar ofta den nationella lagstiftningen i sina medlemsstater. Europeiska unionens medlemsstater måste ge verkan åt vissa former av gemenskapslagstiftare, även om de skiljer sig väsentligt från självutförande fördrag. Skillnaden är att det inte är de nationella domarna som ska avgöra om bestämmelserna är självverkställande eller inte, utan snarare EG-domstolen som ska tolka dem enligt sina konstitutionella fördrag. Andra former av internationell rätt som bildas genom resolutioner eller liknande kanske inte har samma effekt för dessa stater. Ändå kan de betrakta dem som former av "mjuk lag" och titta på dem för att tolka lagens avsikt. Ibland påverkar proklamationer från de rättsliga organen i internationella organisationer som Inter-American Court of Human Rights deras medlemsstater. Även om dessa proklamationer inte är bindande för medlemsstaterna, verkar de nationella domarna hänvisa till dessa för auktoritativ tolkning.<br/><br/>Därför måste en fall-till-fall-strategi tas samtidigt som man analyserar de förfaranden och prejudikat som fastställs i olika länder. För att undersöka begreppet självutförande fördrag kommer detta dokument att jämföra prejudikat som fastställs av olika jurisdiktioner. Om läsaren vill göra en liknande analys kan de göra det genom att titta på de olika nationella årsböckerna om internationell rätt. För det mesta kommer dessa årsböcker att ha ett avsnitt som ägnas åt förhållandet mellan internationell och nationell rätt.<br/><br/>Internationell rättspraxis:<br/><br/>Den viktigaste frågan för nationella domstolar är om fördraget är självverkställande? Om fördraget kan tillämpas utan att någon ytterligare inhemsk lagstiftare har passerat för att förstärka det. Denna fråga togs upp i målet Czesáw S mot statskontoret och ministern för statskontoret, där den polska författningsdomstolen ansåg att eftersom fördragets bestämmelser hänvisade till inhemska åtgärder som skulle vidtas, var fördraget inte självverkställande till sin natur (Bug river claims, Czesáw S mot statskontoret och ministern för statskontoret, 2003). I huvudsak, när fördraget hänvisar till inhemska åtgärder som ska vidtas, skapar det inte i sig nya skyldigheter. Det förstärker i stället fördragets avsikt att den inhemska rättsliga processen ska vidta åtgärder för detsamma. En liknande fråga togs upp i Sosa-fallet i USA. I detta fall övervägde domstolen om den internationella konventionen om medborgerliga och politiska rättigheter var ett självutförande fördrag. Den amerikanska högsta domstolen har också förklarat att den internationella konventionen om medborgerliga och politiska rättigheter inte är ett självverkställande fördrag (Domstolen, 2004). Den federala högsta domstolen i Schweiz undersökte också den internationella konventionen om medborgerliga och politiska rättigheters självverkställande karaktär. Frågan inför domstolen var om artikel 13.2 b och c var självverkställande till sin natur. Domstolen undersökte om fördraget delvis var självverkställande och gjorde det genom att kontrollera om det fanns ett minimum av kärninnehåll för att fördraget skulle vara tillämpligt. Domstolen ansåg att den inte fann någon sådan bestämmelse i fördraget (A och B mot regeringen i kantonen Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>Det är viktigt att förstå att dessa frågor skiljer sig från den grundläggande frågan om huruvida internationell rätt kan tillämpas som en del av landets lag? För att besvara denna fråga kommer tidningen att granska domen från Dominikanska republikens högsta domstol. Högsta domstolen uppgav att artikel 3 i Dominikanska republikens konstitution gjorde internationell rätt bindande för den inhemska rättsordningen. Domstolen avvisade Superior Land Courts tolkning att dessa fördrag var "främmande lagstiftare" och inte en del av den inhemska rättsordningen. Högsta domstolen fastställde att alla avtal som ratificerats av Dominikanska republiken utgjorde en del av Dominikanska lagen och därför kan betecknas som självverkställande (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). Den federala högsta domstolen i Schweiz har undersökt om Libson-fördraget var självutförande och direkt tillämpligt på schweiziska universitet. Enligt relevant rättspraxis är en traktatsnorm direkt tillämplig om dess innehåll är tillräckligt exakt och tydligt för att ligga till grund för ett beslut i ett visst fall. Normen måste således vara rättvis, det vill säga definiera en individs rättigheter och skyldigheter och vara riktad till de behöriga myndigheterna" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). Detta innebär att huruvida fördraget är direkt tillämpligt eller inte beror på om normen är berättigad. Lissabonfördraget bygger på principen om kvalifikationer som förvärvats ombord. Detta förmedlas genom artikel IV.1 i fördraget. Syftet med detta var att skapa en skyldighet för stater att visa att deras beslutsprocess är rättvis, transparent och icke-diskriminerande. Ansvaret för att bevisa att sökanden inte har uppfyllt de nödvändiga kriterierna ligger på det organ som utför bedömningen. Fördraget garanterar rättssäkerhetsgarantier, som är allmänt accepterade av länder och därmed domstolen ansåg detta fördrag vara självutförande. Detta fortsätter med att visa de olika tolkningar som görs av domstolarna i olika länder.<br/><br/>Det är viktigt att observera om de normer som fastställs i fördragen verkligen följs. Ärendelagarna från olika jurisdiktioner har betonat att nationella domstolar är den slutliga myndigheten i frågan om huruvida ett fördrag är självverkställande. Det finns också en inneboende skyldighet för länder att följa och fullgöra fördrag. Sådant är gjutet av Pacta Sunt Servanda-regeln som är inskriven i artikel 26 i Wienkonventionen om fördragsrätt (VCLT). Artikel 27 förstärker den ytterligare genom att slå fast att man inte kan bortse från folkrättsliga förpliktelser genom att använda nationell rätt som motivering, vilket många länders domstolar har använt som en källa till tolkning, till exempel den lettiska författningsdomstolen. När det gäller en nationell norm som strider mot en internationell norm ansåg domstolen att den nationella normen var ogiltig. För att komma fram till sin slutsats har domstolen starkt åberopat det nödvändiga fullgörandet av fördragen i god tro i enlighet med artikel 26 i VCLT (Linija mot Lettland, 2004).<br/><br/>Slutsats:<br/><br/>Av ovanstående framgår att fördragen har särskilda krav innan de kan betraktas som självutförande, men att hålla alla dessa åt sidan är fortfarande den viktigaste tolkningen av de nationella domstolarna. De nationella domstolarna avgör om fördraget kan kallas självverkställande eller inte. Även om deras konstitution kan innehålla en bestämmelse om att traktaträtten är landets högsta lag, tolkar domstolar från olika länder dessa bestämmelser på olika sätt. Detta kan ses som hur de amerikanska och dominikanska konstitutionerna båda innehåller dessa bestämmelser men följer helt olika tolkningar av samma. Begreppet "självutförande" stämmer kanske inte överens med dessa fördrag, eftersom de i praktiken fortfarande behöver godkännas av de nationella domstolarna. Idealiskt sett bör vägen framåt vara att länderna erkänner fördragens självutförande och behandlar dem på ett sätt som respekterar artiklarna 26 och 27 i konventionen. Återigen är detta den "ideala" situationen och kommer sannolikt inte att hitta sin väg till statlig praxis i vissa jurisdiktioner när som helst snart. Fortfarande kan hopp vinnas genom att titta på tolkningar av nationella domstolar som respekterar dessa normer och förhoppningsvis bana väg för andra domstolar att erkänna detta.<br/><br/>Referenser:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Bakom kulisserna tragedier som påverkade gjutna av TV: s dödligaste fångst<br/><br/>Sänkta fiskekvoter<br/><br/>Även om besättningen på Deadliest Catch gör majoriteten av sina pengar från Discovery, betyder det inte att de faktiskt inte säljer sitt drag. Så man kan säga att de har två inkomstkällor, vilket är något som de flesta i deras yrke inte har.<br/><br/>Men tillbaka i 2017 startade Alaska Department of Fish and Game ett kvotsystem, vilket begränsade mängden fisk som någon fiskebåt kunde ta tillbaka till stranden med hälften. Besättningen på Deadliest Catch har haft en enorm vinstminskning i flera år. |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGGAR<br/><br/>Kolla in vår samling av bloggar skrivna av andra medarbetare.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONSBLOGGAR<br/><br/>Stressa inte det<br/><br/>av<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Maj 12, 2019<br/><br/>Stress, oavsett hur bra saker går, det kan alltid hitta ett sätt att höja sitt fula huvud. Oavsett om det är en sista minuten jobbförfrågan eller ett papper som du glömde att skriva och det beror på nästa dag, kan stress alltid hitta en väg in i din dag om du tillåter det. Idag kommer jag att visa dig några saker du kan göra för att eliminera eller förebygga stress.<br/><br/>Det första du kan göra är att träna. Träning är ett bra sätt att lindra stress eftersom det sänker stresshormonet i kroppen som kallas kortisol. De lägre nivåerna av kortisol i kroppen, desto lägre blir din stressnivå. Övning kan också öka ditt självförtroende, och när ditt självförtroende är upp är din stress vanligtvis nere. För mig, när jag blir stressad, tränar jag alltid genom att gå till gymmet och träna boxning, det hjälper mig att bränna kalorier och minska stress samtidigt som jag har kul.<br/><br/>Att skriva ner saker har varit ett sätt att lugna ner människor under en mycket lång tid, och det är nästa ämne på vår lista. Att skriva ner vad som gör dig stressad är ett sätt att rensa sinnet, och det hjälper också att bli av med stress. Jag har en liknande erfarenhet när jag skriver historier, vanligtvis om jag inte kan tänka på en ny idé på grund av en gammal, kommer jag att skriva ner den gamla idén och tänka på den. Det är när nya idéer börjar dyka upp och jag kan fortsätta skriva normalt. Det är samma sak med stress. Tänk på en ström som fortsätter att strömma ner i sin väg tills den träffar en bäverdamm, och den dammen blockerar vattenflödet och allt börjar byggas upp. Det enda sättet att få vattenflödet tillbaka till det normala är att ta bort dammen. Det är här skrivandet kommer in. När du skriver ner det tar du bort stress bit för bit tills du kan tänka normalt igen.<br/><br/>Stress kan komma in i våra liv genom dörrar i våra liv som vi håller öppna. Förhalning är ett sätt att vi kan lämna dörrarna öppna för stress. Att vänta tills imorgon kan vara kul för idag, men det kommer att skada dig imorgon, och är en mycket kortsiktig lösning. Ju längre du väntar på att göra något, desto större blir det, och ju större blir det desto mer stress kommer du att bjuda in i ditt liv. Att ta hand om något så fort vi får det är ett bra sätt att förebygga stress, men det är något som tar stor disciplin att göra. Ju mer du skär Procrastination ur ditt liv, desto mer stressfri blir du. Så stäng dörren, du släpper ut all kall luft.<br/><br/>Så låt oss granska: Motion, Skriv ner vad som stressar dig, och Förhala inte. Dessa är bara några sätt att lindra stress, men för mig är de mest effektiva. Även om jag vet att dessa kanske inte fungerar för alla skulle jag vilja bjuda in någon som känner sig stressad att undersöka hur man blir av med det. |
