| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 maj 2015<br/>Postat av Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa är en flerårig växt som trivs i sumpiga subtropiska och tropiska regioner runt om i världen. Den högt ansedda örten är en viktig ingrediens i Doxiderol, ett näringstillskott som förbättrar kognitiv funktion. Bacopa valdes för sin förmåga att skydda hjärnan och öka acetylkolin, en biokemisk budbärare som gör det möjligt för nervsystemet att vidarebefordra information.<br/><br/>Ayurvediska utövare beskrev först de terapeutiska egenskaperna hos bacopa i 300 BC. Läkarna registrerade bacopas förmåga att förbättra intelligens och minne. Nästan 2500 år senare bekräftar en växande mängd modern forskning de kognitiva fördelarna med bacopa som registrerats i den ayurvediska texten.<br/><br/>År 1987 utvärderade forskare i Indien effekterna av bacopa på skolbarns intellektuella funktion. Under den fyra veckor långa studien administrerade de bacopa till 40 barn som var 6 till 8 år gamla. Forskarna bestämde att bacopa ökade uppfattningen och minnet. Barnen kunde lösa labyrintövningar snabbare och mer exakt efter att ha fått bacopa. Många föräldrar i Indien använder rutinmässigt bacopa för att förbättra sina barns intellektuella utveckling.<br/><br/>En 12-veckors studie publicerad i augusti 2001-utgåvan av Psychopharmacology undersökte effekterna av bacopa på kognitiv funktion. Forskare slumpmässigt tilldelade de friska frivilliga, i åldern 18 till 65, för att få bacopa eller en inaktiv substans. De använde också en dubbelblind konfiguration för studien för att dölja produkternas identiteter. Forskare använder denna design för att säkerställa att testresultaten är giltiga eftersom det eliminerar bias av forskarna och deltagarna. Bacopa-gruppen upplevde en signifikant förbättring av den hastighet med vilken de kunde bearbeta visuell information. Deltagarna lärde sig också snabbare och lagrade nya minnen mer effektivt.<br/><br/>År 2007 avslöjade en Texas A & M College of Medicine laboratoriestudie en av de mekanismer som är ansvariga för bacopas förmåga att främja hjärnans hälsa. Enligt forskarna använder bacopa polyfenoler för att förhindra oxidativ stress och den skada som det orsakar friska hjärnceller. Bacopa minskar också skadliga avlagringar av ett ämne som kallas beta-amyloid, som är den primära komponenten i plack i hjärnan hos patienter med Alzheimers sjukdom.<br/><br/>En dubbelblind studie publicerad i juli 2008-utgåvan av Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine utvärderade effekten av bacopa på äldre patienter. Studien bekräftade att bacopa ökade kognitiv prestanda samtidigt som stressen minskade. Enligt författarna bekräftade de fördelar som uppnåtts i denna studie resultaten av tidigare forskning.<br/><br/>En 90-dagars studie publicerad i december 2008-utgåvan av Phytotherapy Research bekräftar de kognitiva fördelarna som tidigare visats i andra bacopa-studier. Bacopa förbättrade signifikant deltagarnas förmåga att tillfälligt lagra och använda information som krävs för att slutföra en komplex uppgift. Den dubbelblinda studien visade också att bacopa minskade den tid som krävs för att bearbeta visuell information.<br/><br/>Förutom att öka nervsignalöverföringen teoretiserar forskarna att bacopa ökar kognitiv funktion genom att minska ångest. Många studier tyder på att ångest stör förmågan att utföra uppgifter som kräver kognitiva funktioner på högre nivå, såsom inlärning och memorisering. Stress stör biokemiska budbärare och hälsosam nervsignalöverföring. Bacopa lindrar stress och återställer en känsla av lugn genom att öka acetylkolinnivåerna, vilket minskar din hjärtfrekvens och gör att du kan ta djupare andetag.<br/><br/>Doxiderol är ett bra sätt att få fördelarna med bacopa. Detta holistiska tillägg innehåller också andra naturliga ingredienser som främjar hjärnans hälsa och stöder din förmåga att fokusera och koncentrera sig på komplex uppgift samt memorera information. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Hon kan också känna demoniska auror såväl som onda auror. När hon föddes och växte var hennes krafter förseglade och hon var mycket mindre kraftfull. Sedan nederlaget för den som förseglar sina krafter har Kagome nått sin fulla potential.<br/><br/>Genom att skapa en fysisk förbindelse har Kagome förmågan att rena både gift och mörker från ett ämne (levande och livlöst). För att göra det projicerar hon sina andliga krafter genom sin hand.<br/><br/>Med sin fulla potential har Kagome förmågan att skapa en barriär runt sig själv och expandera den runt andra. Det är en kupolformad barriär som kan förstöra svaga demoner som kommer i kontakt med barriären.<br/><br/>FÖRBÄTTRAD ÖGONSIKT<br/>Kagome har förmågan att se saker som ofta är osynliga för det mänskliga ögat: spöken, andar, gudomliga och onda auror.<br/><br/>FÖRMÅGOR MED VAPEN<br/>Kagome har förmågan att använda pil och båge. Hon har blivit självutbildad, och efter år av övning missar hennes pil sällan sitt märke. Vid sidan av detta har Kagome förmågan att ingjuta sina pilar med krafter. Hon kan ingjuta en pil med sina andliga krafter som gör det möjligt för dem att penetrera demoniska krafter, förstöra trollformler och rena föremål. Hon kan ingjuta sin båge med sina krafter och avleda fiendens attacker. Hon har förmågan att ingjuta sina pilar med renande energi för att rena gift samt kraftfulla, långa avlägsna demoniska attacker.

Det var ljudet av ett avlägset minne, en röst som hon hade börjat glömma men desperat klamrade sig fast vid alla samma. Det var hennes mors röst, förvriden i sin förlorade dotters sorg. Efter allt förvisade Kagome spårlöst. Hon mindes livligt de ögonblicken, hur dagen hade börjat, vad hon hade till frukost och det sista hon hade sagt till sin mor. Det var hemsökande, dessa minnen, eftersom det var som någon annan gång hon hade glidit mellan världar. Hon hade vaknat, håglös, eftersom hon inte hade något syfte utanför skolan. Hon kunde hitta ett jobb, och var planerad för en intervju den dagen. Hennes hjärta hade inte varit i det, men det var vad hon behövde göra.<br/><br/>Hon kom ihåg känslan av rädsla, suga upp det och ge sig själv ett peptalk att hon kunde göra detta. Att hon kunde utvecklas i det liv som hon var tänkt att nu att saker och ting hade avgjorts i det förflutna. Hon hade naturligtvis en kvardröjande känsla av att hon inte längre hörde hemma i sin egen tid eller i sitt eget liv, inte med allt som hon hade lämnat efter sig.<br/><br/>Kagome kom ihåg känslan av träet under hennes fingrar, hur hennes hand hade krökt sig in i handtaget för att glida dörren öppen. Hon kom ihåg att hon pausade och vände sig till sin mamma med ett ljust och livfullt leende när hon skakade sig från sin stupor. "Jag tar av." Hon mindes hur stark hennes röst lät, leendet på hennes mors läppar som hennes ögon lyste av stolthet. Hennes mor tog farväl, vilket inte verkade annorlunda än tidigare, men på något sätt lade sig tyngden av orden tyngre på Kagomes axlar ju mer hon reflekterade.<br/><br/>Kortfattat flimrade tankarna framåt och undrade om hennes mamma oroade sig över henne, saknade henne som hon gjorde. Kagome kunde öppet erkänna att hennes mors styrka, hennes stöd för det faktum att hennes dotter gled genom tiden så ofta. Det fanns tillfällen då hon trodde sig vara svag för att hon inte hade kvinnan att luta sig mot.<br/><br/>Men hon kom ihåg att hon samlade på sig en mager mängd styrka, hon kunde komma ihåg förändringen i luften, temperaturen märkbart annorlunda än vad hon hade förväntat sig, blinkande på den plötsliga och obekanta omgivningen. Det var inte hennes familjs helgedom. Och när hon vände sig om för att gå tillbaka, för att glida in genom dörren hon hade kommit igenom, möttes hon av obekant och kall metall under fingertopparna och ett inre som inte var ingången till hennes hus. En man stod framför henne, bakom en disk, som stirrade på henne med ögon lika breda som hennes egna.<br/><br/>Hon fick åtminstone inte panik, att slitas genom tiden och placeras i omöjliga situationer byggde åtminstone din viljestyrka så långt som märkliga händelser gick. För det var inte varje dag som någon släpades in i det förflutna av en demon, med avsikt att slita en kraftfull juvel från sin kropp som de inte ens visste fanns där. Och så var det faktum att hon hade krossat sa kraftfulla juvel i vem vet hur många bitar och hade till uppgift att hitta dem. Sådana saker var inte normala, och hon hade behövt torget upp och rulla med det när hon insåg att det var hennes verklighet. Det hade verkat så enkelt, samla bara skärvorna och fixa juvelen.<br/><br/>Men det hade inte varit lätt, det var många demoner efter skärvorna och juvelen själv. Och en särskilt kraftfull demon med en önskan att han var fast besluten att se uppfyllt. Än i dag hade hon aldrig fått veta hans önskan men visste att den aldrig hade blivit uppfylld ens när han hade fått det sprängda färdigt. Han hade förstört så många liv för ingentings skull. Förstört så många liv för en så meningslös uppgift. Naraku hade varit den svåraste fienden, och den som hade varit centrum för allt som hade gått fel i alla hennes väns liv.<br/><br/>Men det var den oförutsägbarheten, den nödvändigheten att rulla med vad som hände och den viljestyrka som hon hade fått från sitt äventyr som hon kom ihåg att dra på för att komma med en historia som passade i ögonblicket som inte verkade alltför nyckfull eller långt hämtad. Hon behövde bli trodd, hon behövde överleva.<br/><br/>Hon hade ljugit genom tänderna för att rädda sitt liv.<br/><br/>"Jag letade efter ett jobb." I slutändan var det inte en fullständig lögn. När allt kom omkring hade hon gått ut ur sitt hus med avsikt att delta i en arbetsintervju. Hennes klädstil skulle åtminstone intyga så mycket. Det var en av de enklare fibs hon någonsin hade berättat.<br/><br/>Och av någon anledning anställde den där galningen henne.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>Kagomed rullade över i sin säng när hon tryckte tillbaka de avlägsna minnena och vägrade att erkänna att hon var riktigt vaken. Hon klöste vid de sista glimtarna av sömn och bad den att återvända och ta henne tillbaka i sin omfamning. Hon slöt ögonen, villig sömn att komma och möttes endast av minnen. ekot av en sång sjöng i fjärran av hennes minnen, en sång som ofta hade plågat henne, given samma namn som henne. Rösten som sjöng påminde inte längre om hennes mor, utan rösterna från barn som hon ofta hade lekt med under uppväxten. De ringde tillbaka minnena, även om det hade varit år sedan hon började detta live, även om hon var lycklig i detta liv, var samtalet av dessa minnen för högt.<br/><br/>Plötsligt föll hon tillbaka in i dem och sömn undvek henne igen. Hon tittade på sig själv i sin familjs omfamning medan Inuyasha drogs tillbaka i brunnen och såg lika förvånad ut som hon hade känt. Minnen från det ögonblicket, dessa känslor, var fortfarande så starka. Känslan av hjärtesorg och sorg vällde upp igen, även om det hade varit så länge sedan hon hade känt att hon hade slitits bort från allt som betydde för henne.<br/><br/>Naturligtvis var hennes familj viktig, och hon var glad att vara i deras armar igen. Hon kunde aldrig helt, verkligen beskriva hur hon hade känt på den tiden. Hon kunde fortfarande inte förklara hur hon kände sig delad i två, med stridande önskningar att vara i både hennes förflutna och nutid. Hon kom ihåg de fåfänga försöken att hoppa genom brunnen, fingrarna klöser på marken i en desperat vädjan att låta henne återvända. Första månaden hemma sov hon inte så mycket som hon grät.<br/><br/>Elysion hade garnerat en liknande reaktion, även om den inte var så häftig eftersom hon inte visste exakt var hon hade glidit igenom eller visste hon var hon kunde maska sig tillbaka. Hennes utforskningar var subtila mellan att arbeta sitt jobb och försöka bosätta sig i det här livet. Hon hade inga avsikter att stanna, inga avsikter att dröja längre än hon behövde. Och medan hon inte försökte så hårt som hon hade när hon försökte återvända till det förflutna, var hennes passion tiofaldig eftersom hon inte hade några band till den här världen, för hon var verkligen ensam ... utan hopp om att någon skulle nå henne.<br/><br/>I sina irrationella stunder trodde hon att juvelen hade dragit henne tillbaka och hittat ett nytt helvete för henne att bo i. Ett nytt helvete som skulle tvinga henne att göra en önskan, men hon kom ihåg mycket tydligt att hon hade önskat att det var borta för alltid. Det stoppade inte hennes drömmar, de gånger hon vaknade i natten snyftande. Och dessa minnen av hennes förflutna var svårast att hantera, det svåraste att glömma. Hennes hjärta började springa i panik när hon vände sig i sängen igen, hennes andedräkt blev en kamp när hon kämpade mot en panikattack inducerad av hennes vandrande sinne så sent på natten.<br/><br/>Hon hatade att känna sig så svag, så rädd.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>Kagome drog sig slutligen ur sängen, hennes rum tändes med ett blekt ljus som var tillräckligt för att leda henne till badrummet. Hon stod framför spegeln, handfatet sprang medan hon stirrade på hennes reflektion. Raven färgat hår täckte hennes ansikte och hon kände sig så illa som hon såg ut. Hennes första morgon i Elysion liknade detta, bara hon var i sämre form.<br/><br/>Hon hade hittat en plats att sova, lyckas utarbeta en affär med ägaren av byggnaden för att tillåta henne att stanna en liten tid utan att betala. Kanske hade det varit Miroku inflytande som tillät henne att slå sådana erbjudanden, som munken var känd för sin väg i charmiga (eller bluffande) människor till att ge dem mer än tillräckligt för det arbete de hade gjort. Munken hade alltid varit så, eftersom de först hade träffats. Han skulle hävda bostad av en herre att vara hemsökt när det inte var eller, hävdar att de var föremål för ett angrepp när de inte skulle vara. Han skulle sälja sina avdelningar och charm för så höga priser. Det fungerade praktiskt taget varje gång och hon undrade varför folk hade varit så villiga att lita på honom.<br/><br/>Kanske var det hans leende, eller det faktum att han var en munk som folket i det förflutna var så villiga att smula. Han bytte aldrig på de svaga, åtminstone. Han gjorde alltid det som var rätt och han var en symbol för styrka för henne ibland när han skulle driva igenom allt för att göra det som var rätt. Han tryckte igenom det faktum att han var döende, att han var förbannad, och försökte göra något åt det snarare än att vältra sig i sitt öde. Han hade drivit sig till gränsen i tiden fram till deras slutliga kamp. Och hon hade varit glad över att de hade besegrat Naraku innan han kunde bli föremål för samma öde som hans far, och hans far före honom.<br/><br/>När det gällde hennes egen charm var hon dock mer rättvis än sin vän och gjorde affären rimlig. Hon tvivlade på att någon i den här världen skulle betala ett rejält pris för en exorcism eller för att fördriva demoner. De var för tekniskt avancerade för det. Men hon var smart nog, och smart nog, att göra en bra affär.<br/><br/>Men nu var Kagome på ett bättre ställe, även om hennes ansiktsuttryck såg likadant ut.<br/><br/>En snabb blick på en klocka på väggen berättade för henne att hon kunde försöka sova längre. Men hon valde bort det och ville inte möta flashbacks igen. Hon tog en dusch istället, med hjälp av det kalla vattnet för att jaga bort sina demoner, för att fylla hennes lungor med ett skarpt andetag och tvinga sig vaken.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>Det fungerade inte.<br/><br/>Inte på det sätt hon ville ha. Det kalla vattnet tvingade verkligen luften i hennes lungor, tvingade hennes sinne att vakna och muskler att gripa. Ett bittert skratt drogs från hennes läppar när hon lutade huvudet tillbaka och fann sig komma ihåg mer. Idag skulle hon inte fly så lätt, hon skulle inte återhämta sig så enkelt, för att återhämta sig bara för att hon ville det.<br/><br/>Ibland går det inte att undvika de tankar man ville, även när man var säker på att man var förbi dem.<br/><br/>Sango skulle ha varit till stor hjälp i den här situationen. Demondräparen var hennes bästa vän, hon skulle till och med gå så långt som att kalla henne den syster som hon aldrig hade. En äldre syster som var klok, hade alltid sin sida när problem uppstod. Särskilt pojkproblem, när sådana saker var ganska triviala men det var roligt att ha en förälskelse och för hennes vän att vara arg på hennes vägnar när Inuyasha gjorde henne ledsen. Det hade ju ofta varit så, att halvdemonen skulle springa till sin döda älskares sida och krossa hennes hjärta mer än en gång.<br/><br/>Men Sango inspirerade henne också på andra sätt. Efter allt kvinnan hade mött hade hon alltid varit så stark, så säker ... Även i de tider som hon hade tvivlat på sig själv, drog hon alltid igenom. Hon beundrade att hon hade förmågan att överleva efter att ha förlorat hela sin familj - påminnelsen om detta ofta drivit Kagome att överleva, eftersom hon förlorade alla till denna värld - och sedan ha sin bror bli en bricka i Naraku. Det var inte lätt, kunde inte ha varit något som vem som helst kunde möta och ändå gå framåt med. Hon log fortfarande, även med den smärtan och de påminnelserna ... Hon var ofta så ljus, även i de mörkare tiderna.<br/><br/>Och just nu ville hon luta sig in på den äldre kvinnans sida, för att ta tröst i det faktum att hon var där och hon var stödjande. Hon kände att Sango på något sätt skulle dra igenom detta och erbjuda några ord av styrka och förståelse. Det var tider som dessa som gjorde dessa besvärjelser värre, den ständiga påminnelsen om att hon var utan sin familj.<br/><br/>"Jag vill inte vara ensam." Hon ropade högt i sin ensamhet, ljudet av duschen dränka vädjan.<br/><br/>Hon var inte rädd för att erkänna det.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>Ännu en timme hade gått innan hon hade insett det. Hennes hud var kall från vattnet och det kändes som is rann genom hennes ådror. Hon hade inte insett att hon hade börjat skaka tills hennes hand sträckte sig för att stänga av vattnet och avsluta sin dusch. Kagome sökte inte sin egen blick i spegeln igen, istället svepte hon in sig i handdukar och traskade ut ur badrummet, uppför trappan och in i sitt kök. Hon började med att göra en lätt frukost, idly läsa igenom sina anteckningar för dagen som maten tillagad.<br/><br/>Hennes karriär tog verkligen fart de senaste åren. Hennes bilder presenterades i många gallerier, hennes namn började ofta många läppar för dem som var intresserade av fotografering.<br/><br/>Jobbet hon hade bett om på ett infall hade utlöst allt. Hon hade varit mycket lyckligare än hon hade förväntat sig att vara i denna värld. Aldrig lycklig nog att glida tillbaka genom sprickorna i sin egen värld, men lycklig nog att göra bra. När hon vände tillbaka till spisen, kom hon ihåg den tid hon äntligen hade gett upp på att återvända hem. Det var ungefär två år in i hennes liv här, eftersom hon hade börjat våga sig in i fotografering som mer än bara en hobby men något hon kunde göra ett namn för sig själv med.<br/><br/>Den dagen hade varit särskilt trevlig, solen stod högt på himlen och hon hade funnit sig själv att ta några bilder av naturen. En liten pojke hade gömt sig i en av växterna, och hon hade fångat en bild av det ögonblick hans ansikte hade lagt sig till ett glatt, busigt grin ögonblicket innan han hade hoppat ut för att skrämma sitt byte. Det påminde henne om Shippou, den lilla kitsune hon hade, i huvudsak, antagit. Han hade också slitits från sin familj när de först hade träffats. Hans far dödade och han var fast besluten att hämnas honom. Som ung verkade han så mogen i sina första möten.<br/><br/>Kanske hade det varit Inuyashas inflytande som tillät kitet att agera som ett barn igen, att vara ung och nyckfull ibland medan andra var han mer mogen. Han erbjöd henne tröst på sitt eget sätt, och hon försökte ta hand om honom som hon skulle sin egen även om hon hade varit så ung då också. Hennes ungdom hindrade henne dock inte från att förstå hur man skulle ta hand om honom eller ta hand om honom som hennes barn. Hennes hjärta svällde, när han log, när han hade varit så glad för sin gåva av kritor och tagit sig tid att göra konst. Hon var så stolt över varje teckning, att han hade slutat, att hon visste, att det var så en mor skulle känna sig i en sådan situation.<br/><br/>Smärtan som hade slitit igenom henne var för mycket, för plötslig. Hon saknade honom och ville se hur mycket han hade vuxit sedan hon hade varit borta. Hon hade saknat så mycket ...<br/><br/>För att bespara sig mer smärta och falska förhoppningar gav hon upp och fokuserade på att förbättra sig själv.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>Frukosten smakade intetsägande, tråkig och inspirerad. Först efter att hon hade slutat insåg hon att hon hade glömt någon form av kryddor eller smak till maten. Det var för sent nu att komma ihåg så mycket, eftersom hennes sinne var för upptagen med att komma ihåg andra detaljer i hennes liv som tydligt hade blivit viktigare än hennes mat.<br/><br/>"Sitt!"<br/><br/>Naturligtvis hände ingenting när hon hade argt skrek på en särskilt frustrerande klient som påminde henne om halvdemonen. Han var särskilt envis och oförskämd och ville ha ett foto som togs på hans sätt snarare än att låta det fungera naturligt. Man kunde försöka tvinga vilda djur att bete sig som man ville. Men sällan lyckades någon med våld. Inuyasha var dock inte lika illa. Inuyasha hade lärt sig innan hon hade tvingats bort från honom. Han hade blivit mildare, mer förstående, mer mogen, även om det fanns tillfällen då han fortfarande var barnslig och kaxig.<br/><br/>Hon minns hur röda hennes kinder hade brunnit, men hur hon stod sig och sparkade honom. Hon sa att hon vägrade att arbeta för någon eller med någon som ville vrida något bortom sin natur, bortom sina egna önskningar.<br/><br/>Hon borde ha jämfört mannen med Naraku snarare än Inuyasha. Även om hennes klient inte hade sådana extrema avsikter. Åtminstone var känslan efteråt ett trevligt minne. Friheten att veta att hon hade kommit så långt att hon kunde vägra arbete som hon inte ville göra, att vara sin egen person som var oberoende av andra. Hon kunde säga att hon gjorde det på den tiden. Trots att hon hörde rykten dagar senare med ord menade att förtala henne.<br/><br/>Hon försvarade sig rättfärdigt, som hon gjorde mot slutet av sin resa. Hon var ju den enda som kunde skydda sig i den här världen.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>Morgonljuset började krypa in i hennes hem och påminde henne igen om tidens gång. Återigen övervägde hon listan över saker hon måste göra och diskuterade var hon skulle börja. Eller om hon ens skulle börja alls. Med hur dagen började visste hon inte om hon kunde anse det som en bra idé. Det var tveksamt om hon skulle lyckas med hur förlorad i sig själv hon blev.<br/><br/>Hon ville inte förstöra sitt senaste arbete, för det hade hon gjort vid ett par tillfällen tidigare.<br/><br/>Kagome kom ihåg känslan av hennes dyra, helt nya, kamera glider ur händerna. Hon var inte beredd att stödja det, eftersom hon just hade tagit bort den från sin väska. En del av henne skrek på insidan. En dramatisk, over-the-top, full på skrik som hon ofta gjorde när hon var mycket, mycket yngre. När hon kämpade för att göra det genom mellanstadiet medan hon hoppade mellan gångerna. Den andra delen av henne hade förblev frusen på plats medan hennes linsen helt krossad och resten av kameran hade brutit tillsammans med den.<br/><br/>Att se Inuyashas bror, en full demon, stå framför henne var det sista hon förväntade sig när hon hade tagit sig ut för sina foton. Han stod så stolt som någonsin, så lång som någonsin, så imponerande som hon kom ihåg. Han såg inte alls ställd ut att vara i en helt annan värld, fastän hon aldrig var bäst på att läsa hans tankar. Hans namn på hennes läppar var så kraftigt, att hon kunde minnas de minsta känslor som hon gjorde. Hennes läppar var spruckna, hennes mun kändes torr, och den bubblande känslan av ångest i magen fick henne att må illa.<br/><br/>Hon ville inte att hennes förhoppningar skulle vara uppe.<br/><br/>Men hon ville att han skulle vara där, även om de inte var vänner. De var allierade, om något, eftersom de hade kämpat sida vid sida. Och något var bättre än absolut ingenting.<br/><br/>Och Kagome hade vett nog att inte kasta sig på honom, att linda sina armar runt honom i lättnad att veta att hon inte var ensam. Hennes kamera spelade ingen roll längre när hon närmade sig honom. Hon kom ihåg att inget annat betydde något i flera dagar när hon tillbringade tid med honom, inte talade om deras värld utan talade (eller, hon talade och han erkände helt enkelt det faktum).<br/><br/>När hon föll för honom kunde Kagome inte minnas. Det var en subtil sak, precis som han var. Men hon visste att känslan var där. Och han lät henne veta att hon inte var ensam om att hon hade fallit, att känslorna på något sätt hade blommat.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>En känsla av tyngdlöshet tog över henne och plötsligt öppnades hennes ögon medan hennes sinne desperat klöste för det sista hon gjorde. Hon kom inte ihåg när hon hade somnat på sin soffa, men hon visste att det sista stället hon hade varit var på alltför bekväma kuddar. Hon kämpade dock inte eller kämpade tyngdlösheten som hon var i bekanta armar. Hennes huvud lutade mot Sesshoumarus bröst och tröstade sig med att han var här och att hon inte var ensam.<br/><br/>"Välkommen tillbaka." Hans svar var en mjuk hum i erkännande. Han behövde inte tala mycket för att hon skulle förstå hans avsikt, eller resten av vad han hade att säga.<br/><br/>Han bar henne tillbaka till sin säng, bosatte henne i det med lätthet. Hennes ögon mötte hans och hon log lätt eftersom inga fler minnen drev tillbaka, inga fler minnen retade på henne. Nej, när han var nära, föll hon aldrig tillbaka i de tankarna. Han hade hjälpt, och åren hade hjälpt.<br/><br/>"Sömn." Han befallde med lätthet, hennes ögon rullade på honom, men hon kämpade inte eftersom hon var trött. Hennes hand klamrade hårt till honom, medan hon kände sin motsatta hand trycka mot pannan i bedömningen av hennes välbefinnande.<br/><br/>"Jag är okej," sade hon, hennes ord fast med sitt löfte.<br/><br/>Hon var okej, hon levde och hon var lycklig.<br/><br/>ÅÅÅÅ<br/><br/>avlastare<br/><br/>sammanfattning<br/><br/>Kagome, vid ett tillfälle i sitt liv, var en ganska vanlig tonårsflicka tills hon attackerades av en demon inne i hennes familjs brunnshus. Demonen släpade henne ner i brunnen, som magiskt transporterade henne cirka 500 år tillbaka i tiden. Där fick hon veta att en helig juvel var innesluten i hennes kropp eftersom hon var reinkarnation av en prästinna som hade dött 50 år före den tid hon drogs in i. Juvelen slets från hennes kropp och demonen som släpade henne genom tiden besegrades av halvdemonen som hon befriade som var fäst vid trädet. Kagome blev vän med halvdemonen, Inuyasha, i tid och reste med honom för att återställa juvelen som hon själv krossade. Även om det inte var så enkelt och lätt att göra så många demoner och människor sökte juvelen för sina egna ändamål. Hon blev vän med en ung kitsune-demon, en munk och en demondräpare som alla reste med henne för att återställa juvelen.<br/><br/>Hennes grupp var dock inte den som fullbordade juvelen utan istället en ond halvdemon som manipulerade de flesta av de stora händelserna i hennes följeslagares liv. När han slutligen samlade alla bitar av juvelen och gjorde sin önskan på det besmittade föremålet, drogs Kagome in i juvelen själv med avsikt att hon gjorde en självisk önskan att hålla henne instängd för alltid och hålla juvelen vid liv. Det var Inuyashas envishet som lyckades rädda henne från mörkret. Till slut återvände hon till sin naturliga tid, avslutade gymnasiet som förväntat av en tjej av hennes tidslinje. Men några dagar senare hamnade Kagome i Elysion. Hon har varit i denna värld i fem år, och har sedan länge gett upp på att återvända hem. Hon har bosatt sig lyckligt in i sitt nya liv.<br/><br/>platonisk<br/><br/>Det är ganska lätt för Kagome att få nya vänner, hon har inte förändrats mycket från sin ungdom. Hon är en glad ung kvinna som är empatisk och välkomnande för det mesta i sitt liv. I sin ungdom blev hon vän med demoner när de flesta skulle frukta dem. Även demoner som brukade äta människor, har hon blivit vän och hon ändrade sina sätt (hon skulle vilja tänka). Med detta sagt är det verkligen lätt att bli hennes vän så länge någon kan visa att de är villiga att bli inlösta, eller visa att de inte är helt onda. Hon känner mycket för alla hon möter, så det är svårt för henne att inte dras till andra i en önskan att vara vänner.<br/><br/>antagonistisk<br/><br/>Det enda sättet att vinna Kagomes vrede är att vara så bedrövlig, så ond, och så långt bortom förlossningen att hon inte kan se något gott i dig. Och hon kan se det goda i i stort sett allt och alla. Ärligt talat, med vem hon har mött? En halvdemon som satte två älskare mot varandra, som förbannade hela den manliga linjen av en av sina vänner, och sedan fick sin bästa väns bror att döda sin familj... Ja, jag ser inte att hon hatar någon utan dem verkligen, verkligen arbetar för det. Feel free att ge det ett skott.<br/><br/>romantiska<br/><br/>När kär, Kagome är ett starkt stöd, alltid vistas där även när saker kan vara grov. Men, Kagome är inte ute efter kärlek, var inte ute efter kärlek när hon kom så några tidigare relationer inte existerar. Detta är inte att säga att någon inte har blivit kär i henne. Hon kan definitivt vara föremål för någons obesvarade kärlek, hon kommer förmodligen att vara omedveten om det, dock. Slutligen är Kagome för närvarande förlovad med Sesshoumaru, överraskande.

Ärligt talat har hon inte arbetat igenom allt ännu eftersom hon i huvudsak var i spetsen för ett fullskaligt krig.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Varför du borde vara på Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Jag är inte, inte heller har jag någonsin påstått att vara, en social media guru. Jag är bara en person som tänker på saker en hel del, och detta har kommit upp ett antal gånger.<br/><br/>Jag är inte en tidig adopter. Ibland tar det mig år att räkna ut vad jag vill använda något till innan jag faktiskt kommer på det, och Twitter var en av de sakerna. Jag har varit på Twitter på allvar sedan februari i år, så jag är ganska ny på det. Fortfarande har jag lärt mig ett antal saker, och jag ville dela dem. Vissa säger att jag är en Twitter pusher, och jag är, eftersom det finns många goda skäl att komma på det, och praktiskt taget inga nackdelar.<br/><br/>Så vad är Twitter? Om du är på internet har du förmodligen åtminstone hört talas om det. Det är ett socialt medienätverk som fungerar som ett forum för konversationer, uppdateringar och nyheter i ett medium mer offentligt än något som Facebook eller LinkedIn. Facebook handlar om vem som vill hitta dig, men Twitter handlar om vem du vill hitta. Dina favoritförfattare, skådespelare, politiker, sångare och forskare är förmodligen på Twitter. Så är dina favorit välgörenhetsorganisationer, radiostationer, nyhetswebbplatser och butiker. Och de vill att du ska hitta dem och lyssna på vad de har att säga. Alla på Twitter, åtminstone till en början, vill prata med dig.<br/><br/>Men varför vara en del av det? Det finns alla möjliga anledningar, och jag ska ge dig några.<br/><br/>Människor och platser Twitter är ett bra sätt att ta reda på om händelser som händer runt om i världen, men också i ditt samhälle. Om du reser och letar efter saker att göra är det ett bra sätt att ta reda på saker som är relevanta för dina intressen (eftersom de personer du följer är personer du är intresserad av). Även om du inte reser, att veta om bra ställen att gå lokalt eller veta att människor du är intresserad av kommer till dem skapar en möjlighet att träffa dem och skapa en djupare relation med dem. Om du går tillbaka till mitt parti inlägg, alla människor i det men två, jag hörde talas om på Twitter och sedan träffade i verkliga livet, och nu är vi ganska goda vänner. Och ju mer du gör detta, desto fler saker du får reda på, och ju fler människor du möter. Och om du följer dem på Twitter vet du redan lite om hur de är. De vill att du ska. Det omvända är också sant, eftersom tweeting inbjuder människor att se hur du är, och de kan göra samma val om dig.<br/><br/>Inspiration och motivation<br/>Inspiration kommer från de konstigaste platserna, och tillströmningen av tweets innebär att det alltid finns nytt innehåll för din fantasi. Jag har en följa först policy, så jag följer nästan vem som helst och går sedan regelbundet igenom och avföljer människor. Jag vet inte vem som ska plantera fröet till ett nytt blogginlägg eller nytt projekt i mig, så jag gillar att hålla mina alternativ öppna. Motivation händer också, eftersom Twitter är precis som livet. Om du omger dig med människor som är ambitiösa, dedikerade, generösa och hårt arbetande, är det lättare att vara så och driva dig själv. Det är lättare att tänka att om de kan planera evenemang, starta projekt eller bara gå upp på morgonen, så kan du också.<br/><br/>Lärande och livsstil Bloggare finns på Twitter. Bloggare som inte är det kan faktiskt vara galna. Och folk bloggar om nästan allt. Om du vill lära dig något är oddsen bra att någon tweetar om det. Dessutom är nyhetstjänster och butiker också anslutna, vilket innebär att du kan få dina nyheter upp till minuten och ta reda på om försäljning och erbjudanden när de börjar. När det gäller livsstil, letar du efter nya receptidéer? Följa några cateringfirmor och se vad de kommer med. Behöver en twist för att cocktailparty? Twitter har folk för det också. Garderob rekommendationer, eller bara vill se vad andra människor gör med sina liv? Det är allt där.<br/><br/>Det finns några vanliga utmaningar jag står inför när jag pratar om detta, och de är legitima hinder. Det kan verka ganska skrämmande, särskilt om du kommer på tåget sent, som jag gjorde. Jag följde bara två personer i månader utan att veta vad jag skulle göra. Men det finns sätt att övervinna dem, och höra att de är från minst frekventa till de flesta.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter är för narcissistiska Jerks<br/>Jag tror att det här kommer från tanken att de flesta tweetar för och om sig själva som ett sätt att få uppmärksamhet. Vad jag inte förstår är varför det är något fel med det, eller varför det gör en till en narcissist eller en idiot. Om någon har något att säga, de vill höras. Brukade vara du skulle stå på gathörnet och skrika. Nu kan du skrika i 140 tecken eller mindre. Twitter är bara ett nytt sätt att höras. Nu, det finns verkligen narcissistiska idioter på Twitter. Ibland är folk idioter, ibland är det jag som är en av dem. Om du inte gillar vad någon säger, oavsett om det är poäng som de gör eller detaljerade konton för sina badrumsaktiviteter, behöver du inte lyssna på Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Jag kan inte hålla koll på allt<br/>Det andra hindret människor ofta tar upp är att de bara inte har tid att hålla reda på alla saker som händer på Twitter. Och vet du vad? Det är bra. Håll koll på vad du kan. Kanske du bara vandrar på några dagar. Om du är en privat användare (snarare än att tweeta för ditt företag), och särskilt en nybörjare, det är okej. En del av något är bättre än allt av ingenting.<br/><br/># 1 Jag har inget jag vill lägga ut där<br/>Det här är den överlägset vanligaste utmaningen som människor tar upp. Och det spelar ingen roll. Du behöver inte gå med i Twitter för att prata. Gå med för att lyssna. Återigen är dina favoritförfattare, sångare, bloggare och tidningar här. Det här är din chans att lyssna på dem. Det är din chans att få ett fönster i deras liv och aktiviteter, och de inbjuder dig att göra det. Vill du ta reda på vad Felicia Day kommer att vara upp till på San Diego Comic Con? Klart. Jag vet människor som bara lyssnar på Twitter, och det är bra. Det är vad jag gjorde ett tag. Så småningom kanske du hittar något att tweeta om eller göra något att tweeta om. Jag hoppas att du gör det, för jag vill höra om det.<br/><br/>Kort sagt, om du inte använder Twitter, tror jag att du borde vara. Om du inte använder det till fullo, försök att. Var inte rädd för att följa femhundra personer, om alla dessa människor säger saker du är intresserad av. Bjud in dessa människor till bitar av ditt liv, och se hur det förbättras av interaktionen. Jag ser fram emot att höra från dig. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>Själva tanken på att få en rotkanal sätter de flesta människor på kanten. SCM Dental använder den senaste tekniken och tekniken för att göra en rotkanal en praktiskt taget smärtfri och låg stressprocedur.<br/><br/>Roterande endodonti är en avancerad teknik och teknik för att utföra endodontisk behandling, den kliniska termen för en rotkanalBegreppet "rotkanal" avser den naturliga håligheten i mitten av tanden. Tandens nerv ligger i mjuk vävnad (massa) inuti rotkanalen. Om tanden skadas antingen av trauma eller förfall kan skräp komma in i det känsliga rotkanalområdet och orsaka en infektion eller under extrema omständigheter och abscess. En abscessed tand är mycket allvarlig och bör behandlas som en nödsituation, eftersom det kan skapa en infektion som kan sprida sig till andra delar av kroppen. Om du tror att du har en abscessed tand, kontakta vårt kontor omedelbart för att schemalägga akutvård.<br/><br/>Beroende på fallet kan rotkanalbehandling kräva mer än ett besök. En första röntgen kommer att tas för att utvärdera tanden och rotkanalen och bestämma omfattningen av skadan och infektionen om den är närvarande. Du kommer att få en form av anestesi för att göra dig avslappnad.<br/><br/>När området är domnat kommer vår tandläkare att skapa en åtkomstkammare till rotkanalen med hjälp av ett elektriskt handstycke. Därefter kommer rotkanalen att skrapas av den infekterade eller skadade vävnaden och nerven. När hela området har rengjorts och polerats kommer tanden att fyllas med en biokompatibel gummiförening som kallas gutta percha. Tanden är sedan täckt med en tandfyllning eller tandkrona för att återställa styrka och funktion.<br/><br/>Endodontisk terapi har ett dåligt rykte som ett smärtsamt förfarande. Med roterande endodonti är en rotfyllning inte mer smärtsam än att ha en tandfyllning placerad. Infektionen och skadorna på nerven är det som skapar den extrema smärtan och obehaget och patienterna kommer att uppleva betydande lättnad efter att ha genomgått rotkanalbehandling. Rotkanaler har en framgångsgrad på 95% och tillåter människor att bevara sina naturliga tänder. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kyrkgård Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Hotell nära Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Nu kallas det för Queen's Wood.<br/><br/>Mellan 1860 och 1880 revs centrum ut ur City of London för att bygga avlopp, järnvägar och nya vägar. Hus revs utan hänsyn till hyresgästerna som var tvungna att hitta vad boende de kunde någon annanstans. Chefer gick till livo i Kensington och St John's Wood, medan de fattigaste trängde in i rookeries som Seven Dials och Lisson Grove. För dem emellan, kontorister och skickliga arbetare, satte spekulativa byggmästare upp rad efter rad av terrasserade villor och herr Pooter flyttade in i Holloway. Folket i Muswell Hill såg hus krypa över fälten i Finsbury Park, upp Crouch Hill och ner på andra sidan, så att 1880 var Crouch End under utveckling och det verkade inte finnas något sätt att hejda flödet. Tio år senare såldes de stora egendomarna på Muswell Hill. Upton Farm såldes och Ecclesiastical Commissioners ville utveckla Churchyard Bottom Wood, nu kallad Queen's Wood. Berättelsen skulle ha gjort en Ibsen-pjäs. Två grupper av ärliga, mycket motiverade människor som kämpar för vad de trodde var rätt. Ecclesiastical Commissioners å ena sidan och Committee of the Hornsey Charities å den andra, trodde båda att de gjorde sitt bästa för andra människor, och allmänheten reste sig mot dem båda i indignation<br/><br/>Vid den tiden var Muswell Hill Road en landsväg, med Southwood Hall i ena änden och Upton Farm i den andra. 1894 byggdes Onslow Gardens, Connaught Gardens markerades ut, och byggare var redo att utveckla Woodlands egendom. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood var en grupp av nedfallna stugor, på en triangulär plats. En odaterad karta, som hålls av Ecclesiastical Commissioners visar sex Wasteland Cottages med en öppning mellan dem - inte en väg, inte metalliserad, men en väg fram till jordgubbsbäddarna bakom. Längre fram fanns ytterligare en lucka som ledde till gångvägar genom träet. Dessa två öppningar skulle ligga till grund för planen. Samma två luckor och den röjda marken, som var jordgubbsfältet, syns på kartan från 1894 nedan. De visas som "Muswell Hill Cottages" och, ganska i förbigående, Peter Sellers skulle bo på samma plats mycket senare. För att utveckla träet som ett bostadsområde behövde kommissionärerna köra två vägar genom från Muswell Hill Road och bygga hus längs dem. Muswell Hill Road frontage ensam skulle inte ha gett utrymme för tillräckligt med hus för att göra satsningen värt.<br/><br/>Marken och stugor hade fått mycket tidigare som allmosor för att hysa gamla människor och hölls på deras vägnar av förtroendemännen för Hornsey Charity Commissioners. På 1890-talet var stugorna tumla ner, i behov av större reparation. Allmänheten, som ville göra det bästa för sina gamla hyresgäster, kunde inte förbättra dem eftersom de inte hade några pengar. Några år innan Ecclesiastical Commissioners hade planerat att utveckla Gravel Pit Wood (nu Highgate Wood) som en bostadsfastighet, men detta hade mött sådant motstånd att de backade ner. I stället, 1886, gav de alla 69 hektar skog till allmänheten. Samtidigt erbjöd de sig att sälja Churchyard Bottom Wood till Hornsey Urban District Council för 25 000 pund, men detta var för mycket för Hornsey att höja på egen hand. Rådet sade att människor som bodde utanför Hornsey också njöt av skogen och andra myndigheter borde hjälpa till, men ingen hjälp gavs. I slutändan föll erbjudandet i vila.<br/><br/>Karta som visar Muswell Hill Cottages som var centrum för kontroversen.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road från omkring 1880.<br/><br/>Det verkar troligt att dessa tre par stugor var de som stod i centrum för tvisten.<br/><br/>Ecclesiastical Commissioners ville samla in pengar till sitt kyrkoarbete i Storbritannien och utomlands. De ansåg att de hade fått den mark som skulle användas för propogat jon av religion och om detta innebar att sälja av mark eller skog, det var ett mindre ont än att begränsa arbetet i kyrkan. De hade gett Gravel Pit Wood till allmänheten: i dess ställe skulle de utveckla Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Förvaltarna av Hornsey välgörenhetsorganisationer ville producera en inkomst för att hjälpa sina fattiga människor, så de gjorde ett erbjudande till kommissionärerna. Deras triangulära landstycke var alltför tafatt format för att kunna utvecklas ekonomiskt, men om kommissionärerna skulle ge dem lite mer mark för att göra det till en fyrkantig plats, skulle de bygga tjugofem snygga villor. Dessa skulle medföra jordräntor på 225 euro per år, som skulle kunna användas för att lindra Hornsey-folkets fattigdom, och i gengäld skulle de tillåta kommissionen att skära två vägar genom deras mark så att kommissionärerna kunde utveckla skogen.<br/><br/>När detta erbjudande blev känt reagerade folk omedelbart med oro.<br/><br/>Den 16 december 1893 frågade Mr Carvell Williams MP i underhuset, om de kyrkliga kommissionärerna hade samtyckt till att sälja en landremsa till Hornsey Charities Trustees på villkor att en befintlig väg breddas till 40 fot, om detta var ett preliminärt till ett byggnadsprogram och om parlamentet skulle ha möjlighet att uttrycka en åsikt.<br/><br/>Herr Leveson Gower, en kyrkoståndskommissarie svarade', "Ja" till första delen.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Förstår jag att det är avsikten att förstöra den delen av Highgate Woods genom att bygga på den?"<br/><br/>Två dagar senare publicerade The Star en artikel värd någon modern tabloid.<br/><br/>Stjärnan<br/>18 december 1893<br/><br/>"Parlamentet måste hålla ett vakande öga på de gamla vandalerna och konfederationerna av de kyrkliga kommissionsledamöterna, de fjärmar alltid en bit mark eller gynnar byggarna i motsats till allmänheten. Kommissionärerna skulle inte sälja Churchyard Bottom-träet till skattebetalarna utan föreslår nu "att öppna det" genom att skära två breda vägar genom det i samband med ett av deras många byggnadssystem. Kommer inte någon att ställa en fråga i parlamentet och kontrollera kommissionsledamoternas politik i fråga om tegel och murbruk?<br/><br/>När detta trycktes hade frågan ställts och svaret var antingen osant eller försåtligt. Times sade i en lång rapport, att komnussionärerna icke voro beredda att giva ett löfte, att parlamentet, eller något annat offentligt organ, skulle få tillfälle att överväga någon plan för byggande på vedens plats.<br/><br/>Situationen sjudde i arton månader tills ecklesiastikkommissionärerna tvingades öppna en utredning, som började vid Highgate den 31 maj 1895, under ledning av en biträdande ecklesiastikkommissionär. Utredningen producerade en uppsjö av tidningsbrev av vilka detta var det viktigaste.<br/><br/>Den dagliga krönikan, 5 juni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM PÅ HIGGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Vill ni hjälpa oss att avvärja vad som skulle vara en katastrof, inte bara för den omedelbara stadsdelen, utan för hela den tätbefolkade norra London? I ingen del av metropolen har byggmästaren varit mer aktiv än i Crouch End och Hornsey. De vackra ängarna för ett år eller två sedan är nu hus och butiker. Ballasthögar har ersatt ståtliga almar och kastanjer, och en gång trevliga byar delar öde Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury och Islington.<br/><br/>---- Objektet är byggandet av två fyrtio fot vägar genom skogen. Vi i detta distrikt vet innebörden av fyrtio fot vägar genom skogen. Det innebär att skogen är dömd. För tio år sedan räddade agitation syster-trä av sextiofem tunnland - The Gravel Pit Woods - och ingen som såg Bank Holiday folkmassor flockas upp Archway Road från de trista gatorna i Holloway, Islington och Clerkenwell, och såg den angelägna njutning av barnen och familjens fester picknick på gräset och bland träden, kunde misslyckas med att inse den enorma välsignelse som beviljandet av Ecclesiastical Commissioners hela detta. ----<br/><br/>--- Ecclesiastical Commissioners äger nästan en tredjedel av den stora socknen Hornsey. Genom de liberala utgifterna för räntebetalarnas pengar vid öppnandet av vägar och distriktets allmänna utveckling har värdet av deras egendom ökats enormt, och från denna oförtjänta ökning drar de varje år stora intäkter. De räntebetalare vars pengar på detta sätt har hjälpt till att skapa det ofantliga godset kan säkert förvänta sig en liberal behandling i gengäld.<br/><br/>Din lydnad,<br/><br/>Undertecknad av kyrkoherden i St James', Muswell Hill, ministern för Park Chapel, Crouch End, en barrister som bor i Onslow Gardens och tre medlemmar av District Council.<br/><br/>Det var ett skott tvärs över bågen på de kyrkliga kommissionärerna. Deras egna religiösa ledare och distriktet rådet, alla upp i armarna säger i själva verket att kyrkan var för rik och bör vara välgörande, inte girig. Att de två prästerna togs med var ett listigt drag, och kom ihåg att detta fortfarande var en av höjdpunkterna i Darwins kontroverser. Darwin hade en splittrad tro på kyrkans läror och många människor skulle ha ogillat kyrkans makt enbart från den synvinkeln. Kyrkan var inte så säker som den låtsades vara.<br/><br/>Kvällsnytt den 7 juni 1895 sade:<br/><br/>"Om de kyrkliga komnussionerna inte tacklas på en gång, kommer byggnadsbläckfisken att få ett grepp om träet som kommer att vara mycket svårt att lossa senare, ----. Därför anstår det Londonborna att vara uppe och göra om de skulle spara en av sina mest förtjusande bitar av rustik natur. Den offentliga utredningen ajourneras till nästa torsdag, och innan dess måste något göras för att övertyga kommissionärerna om att medborgarna i London inte kommer att tolerera konfiskeringen av en av deras favoritlekplatser.<br/><br/>I ett brev i Daily Chronicle dagen därpå stod det:<br/><br/>.... Det var med stor lättnad, som de boende för omkring tio år sedan fingo höra, att köpet af Övre Skogen hade verkställts; och huru förtjusande en välsignelse detta har bevisat, kan var och en, som besökte dem, vittna, men alla, som ansträngde sig för att rädda dessa öfre skogar, hvilka ligga på västra sidan om Muswell Hill-vägen, kände, att deras seger var ofullständig, så länge de sextio tunnlanden på östra sidan förblevo i fara. Det är så att säga en olyckshändelse att skogen delas av en bred landsväg. Kan någon tvivla på vad effekten skulle bli om Kyrkogården Bottom Wood ersattes av rader av små villor, som var och en sänder ut sitt bidrag av rök och sot? Kan någon också betvivla den allvarliga skillnad det skulle göra för den pittoreska inställningen av de inköpta skogarna om en rad stirrande nya hus skulle köras upp mitt emot deras lummiga fasad?<br/><br/>Detta uttryckte många människors åsikter. I själva verket hade Gravel Pit Wood, som författaren kallar "Övre Wood", inte köpts, men ges till distriktet av den kyrkliga kommissionen, en punkt som de skulle upprepa gång på gång under åren, men de flesta ignorerade det. Kommissionen tänkte inte ge bort en andra ved vad någon sade, och höll denna ståndpunkt till slutet.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, från 5 Cranley Gardens, uppmanade i ett brev till Times den 8 juni 1895 till köp.<br/><br/>Jag vet, att det är vanligt att tala strängt om de ecklesiastiska kommissionärerna, men som förvaltare av en fond är de bundna att administrera det till största fördel, och därför, om något skall göras för att rädda rivningen av träet, verkar det för mig att det endast kan ske genom köp av fastigheten från Comnussioners, som jag vet, är fullt levande till skydd för fria och öppna utrymmen för de människor som jag skulle ha gjort.<br/><br/>(Detta hänvisar till Crouch End Playing Fields som hade säkrats några år senare.)<br/><br/>Som ordförande för Muswell Hill Conservative Association är jag ständigt i kontakt med invånarna, och jag kan med säkerhet bekräfta att varje person bosatt i grannskapet skulle göra något för att bevara.<br/><br/>(Allt han personligen ville ha var välgörenhetsinkomster för att försörja sitt fattiga folk. Han krävde sin tunnland mark - inte mycket säkert - han trodde på kommissionärernas försäkran om att skogen inte var i fara.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road var en av de bästa i Hornsey och skulle förbli lika vackra, hus eller inga hus.<br/><br/>(Och så kom den stora retoriska blomstringen.)<br/><br/>Ska de fattiga lida på grund av sentimentala invändningar och det hysteriska ropet från vargen som just väckts av era korrespondenter? En tunnland av back-land läggas till välgörenhet-egendom skulle göra någon märkbar skillnad för den kvarvarande marken, medan vinsten som härrör från det skulle hjälpa många fattiga gamla och förtjänta personer i deras fallande år och gör det möjligt för oss att överlämna till våra efterträdare ett gods som i en avlägsen framtid skulle vara av stort värde i att ge välgörande stöd till de förtjänta fattiga i socknen Hornsey. "<br/><br/>När man läser hans brev känner man hysteri mycket nära ytan. Varför trodde han att kommissionärerna ville bygga en väg? Varför skulle de spendera alla de pengarna om inte för att bygga hus? Han tycktes aldrig inse, att för ett tunnland land skulle hela veden gå förlorad, men han hade länge varit med om problemet. Han var den person som kommissionärerna hade gjort erbjudandet om försäljning för 25 000 pund tidigare och det är hans namn som hedras i en plakett på Crouch End Clock Tower för att spara träet, men hans förtroende för de kyrkliga kommissionärerna verkar naiv. Det är sorgligt att han vid undersökningen skulle kastas som djävulen.<br/><br/>Utredningen fortsatte<br/><br/>Den ajournerade öppnades i Highgate den 15 juni 1895. I väntan på en stor samling hade rådskammaren ändrats helt. De vanliga borden hade tagits bort och rummet fyllts med stolar. Klockan halv sju var rummet trångt, med folk som jostlar om platser.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, kommissionären, sa att undersökningen var enkel och Hornsey Parochial Charities ville köpa en bit mark som gränsade till deras välgörenhetsfastighet på baksidan. Frågan var om välgörenhetskommissionen, som kontrollerade alla välgörenhetsorganisationer, hade tillräckligt med makt för att stoppa dem. Kyrkokommissarierna var beredda att sälja marken till mycket fördelaktiga villkor och välgörenhetens inkomster skulle bli mycket betydande ökade.<br/><br/>Mot detta fanns tre klasser av invändningar.<br/><br/>Den ursprungliga Trust var i syfte att tillhandahålla stugor för de fattiga, men förvaltarna föreslog att bygga villor som skulle bli för dyra för de fattiga. Det låg dock i förtroendemännens makt att variera villkoren för förtroendet, så de kunde bygga villor om de trodde att de fattiga skulle gynnas i slutändan. De fattiga människorna själva kunde invända, men liberala bestämmelser hade redan utlovats åt dem. den tredje invändningen gällde frågans estetiska och offentliga sida. Han tog det från vad han hade läst att välgörenhetskommissionen borde ingripa för att förhindra de kyrkliga kommissionärerna från att utöva sin egen diskretion i hanteringen av sin egen egendom.<br/><br/>Utredningen diskuterade fina punkter, men talarna fortsatte att komma tillbaka till det stora problemet med att förhindra förstörelse av träet. Vestry Clerk i Islington, som representerade 300 000 människor, gjorde en formell protest om någon del av träet, så värdefullt för folket i Islington och Hornsey som används för privata ändamål. Wilfred White sade att om kommissionärerna skulle ge dem tid skulle de kunna samla in pengar för att kompensera förvaltarna.<br/><br/>Beaumont sa att de inte ville ha villor, de ville ha stugor för fattiga människor som drevs ut ur distriktet. Andra sade att det inte fanns några pengar att bygga stugor för att ersätta de nuvarande förfallna, men villor skulle vara ett ekonomiskt förslag. Andra svarade att det fanns poäng av villor att släppa in Highgate. Träet var heligt. Håll dig till frågan om skogen.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher sa att ropet bland det arbetande folket var att det inte fanns någonstans att gå. Arbetande människor kom till honom med ropet: "Vi drivs ut ur Highgate och är tvungna att gå till Highgate New Town." Om Muswell Hill Road-fronten såldes var det ingen tvekan om att vägarna skulle kunna skäras rakt genom skogen i riktning mot Hornsey, men om kommissionärerna inte kunde få marken från välgörenhetskommissionen kunde de inte skära vägen.<br/><br/>Han var mycket säker på att stugorna kunde sättas i ett lämpligt skick av reparation. Han tillfrågades av de fattiga, av polisen och av ett antal av de arbetande klasserna att representera dessa två punkter, att stugboende var mycket välbehövligt i Highgate och att om de en gång tillät att marken såldes, fanns det inget som talade om var byggmästarens hand skulle stanna.<br/><br/>(Livliga och långvariga jubel).<br/><br/>Talrika andra personer talade och komnussionären sammanfattade med att han ansåg att den rådande uppfattningen var för att behålla stugorna men mötet borde inte dra några slutsatser av vad han hade sagt (Groans).<br/><br/>Andra sade att välgörenhetens förvaltare hade misslyckats i sina uppgifter genom att låta stugorna falla i förfall.<br/><br/>Mr H.R. Williams, förvaltaren som hade skrivit till tidningen tidigare, sade att han hade det på bästa auktoritet att kyrkan kommissionärerna skulle göra några vägar alls och de skulle inte gynnas ett dugg av de åtgärder som Charity kommissionärerna. Andra var mycket mindre tillitsfulla och mötet avslutades efter nästan tre timmar.<br/><br/>"Vi står inför det faktum att i Highgate och Muswell Hill finns det ett antal personer som vill ha Churchyard Bottom Wood och kommer inte att vara glada förrän de har fått det - medan ingen verkar villig att spendera en fjärd för att betala för det. Alla säger att det skulle vara en bra sak att ha träet som öppen plats, men alla tycker att det är någon annans plikt att göra det till en. Islington Vestry har "löst" i ämnet, men Islington Vestry erbjuder inte ett örestycke mot köpet. Det finns inget svårare problem för samhället eller individen att lösa än hur man får besittning av andras egendom utan att betala för det.<br/><br/>Att betala för det var verkligen problemet som Churchyard Bottom Wood blev föremål för intensiv lokal och nationell debatt. En gemensam kommitté bildades för att samla in pengar för att rädda skogen. Den 20 november 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, skrev till The Standard, en dagstidning på den tiden, vädjade om hjälp. Han påminde alla om risken att förlora träet och sa att det bara kunde sparas genom att köpa det. Kyrkokommissionärerna skulle sälja för 25 000 pund och en extra (5000 skulle krävas för fäktning och dränering, vilket gjorde totalt 30 000 pund. Detta var för mycket för Hornsey Council att höja men de hade redan röstat 10 000 pund mot totalen. Skogen var av ovärderligt värde för hela norra London, så han vädjade till offentliga organ och privatpersoner att höja de återstående 20 000 punden. Han varnade för att det nuvarande erbjudandet från kyrkans kommissionärer var öppet först i slutet av 1898. Därefter skulle byggarna flytta in.<br/><br/>Överklagandet välkomnades varmt av pressen. En privat proposition skyndades igenom parlamentet och Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, blev lag. Conunittee hade nu rätt att annonsera för bidrag till att köpa Wood och bevara den.<br/><br/>På ganska kort tid samlades nästan alla pengar in, men de sista tusen visade sig vara mycket svåra att samla in och kommissionsledamöternas tidsfrist var bara några veckor bort. Cory-Wright skrev inlaga för mer tid men beviljades bara tre månader och då endast om ränta på 4 procent betalades för den extra perioden på hela beloppet. I slutändan gjorde London County Council, som ursprungligen hade erbjudit 2 500 pund, detta upp till 5 000 pund och totalen nåddes, men det var en näragående sak.<br/><br/>Rådet beslutade att byta namn på Wood som "Queen's Woods" för att hedra drottning Victorias Diamond Jubilee och Hornsey satte på en fin visning av bunting när hertiginnan av Albany formellt förklarade Wood öppen "för fri användning av allmänheten för alltid".<br/><br/>Medan kampanjen för att rädda Churchyard Bottom Wood drevs och leddes av lokalbefolkningen som kände passionerat för denna speciella skogsmark, uppmanade de hjälp och erfarenhet av ett stort nätverk av människor, av vilka några hade arbetat tillsammans på liknande kampanjer i över trettio år. Kommittén utfärdade ett överklagande, tryckt på papper av mycket god kvalitet och med några kända namn.<br/><br/>Frågorna om öppet utrymme och folkhälsa var viktiga ämnen i den viktorianska visionen.<br/><br/>Open Spaces-rörelsen<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, den store bostadsreformatorn, som hade börjat med tre gamla hus i Marylebone, som köptes åt henne av Jolm Ruskin, hade snabbt blivit expert på att hysa fattiga människor under så hälsosamma förhållanden som möjligt. Hennes sätt var att köpa hyreskontrakt och sedan slå ner några av de trånga husen för att få ljus och luft till resten, i tron att frisk luft och solljus var det enda sättet fattiga människor kunde räddas från "putrid feber. Hon hade lärt sig detta som barn från sin farfar, Southwood Smith, som utvecklade sina teorier på Fever Hospital vid King's Cross.<br/><br/>Han hade byggt de första industriella bostäderna för fattiga människor och hade bevisat statistiskt att bra luft och anständig dränering räddade liv. Gibson Gardens, i Northwold Road, är ett direkt resultat av Southwood Smiths idéer. Mer information om Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Vikten av öppen luft<br/><br/>Öppna ytor och möjlighet att andas ren luft, var avgörande för människor som bodde i ett eller två trånga rum. Octavia Hill tog sina avgifter från Lisson Grove slummen, upp Fitzjohn Avenue till Hampstead Heath. Hon älskade så Fitzjohn's Avenue-fälten att hon försökte köpa dem som en offentlig park. De skulle kosta 10 000 pund och inom tre augustiveckor hade 8 500 pund höjts. Det behövdes bara slutet av sommarlovet och återkomsten från semestern av sympatiska vänner och de ytterligare 1 500 punden skulle ha höjts, men ägarna drog plötsligt tillbaka sitt erbjudande. Trots alla vädjanden var fälten täckta med stora hus.<br/><br/>Ur detta utvecklades kampanjen för att rädda Parliament Hill, nästa öppna utrymme norrut från Lisson Grove, köpa upp åkrar i byggarnas väg för att göra en permanent cordon sanitalere mot de framryckande tegelstenarna. Parliament Hill Fields-kampanjen var så framgångsrik att Hampstead Heath Bill godkändes och det fanns pengar över från överklagandet. Från dessa pengar och drivkraften mot öppna ytor var att utveckla National Trust. Octavia Hill hade varit intresserad av att skydda områden som Church Bottom Wood i åratal, så hon var en naturlig allierad i kampen för att rädda Wood.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society var också bekant med denna typ av agitation och penninginsamling. De hade rivit fäktning när herrgårdens herrar hade inneslutit delar av gemensam mark, vilket ledde till både lagliga och olagliga strider mot den arroganta privatiseringen av mark som traditionellt var fri. Robert Hunter, deras hedersadvokat från 1868, var alltid intresserad av att säkra öppna ytor, stora eller små, för allmänheten. Han, nu Sir Robert Hunter, blev ordförande för kyrkans bottenappell. Ordförande för Commons Preservation Society var Shaw-Lefevre MP (senare Lord Eversley) som spelade en stor roll i detta och andra kampanjer i underhuset. Octavia Hill hade varit involverad i deras arbete från omkring 1875.<br/><br/>Samtidigt drev Octavia Hill en kampanj för en begravningsräkning.<br/><br/>Stadskyrkogårdar hade blivit så fulla och så allvarliga en hälsofara, genom att förorena brunnar från vilka människor hämtade sitt dricksvatten, att stadsbegravningar inte längre var tillåtna. Istället skapades kyrkogårdar i utkanten av staden. Abney Park Cemetary var en av dessa. Det fanns då en rörelse för att ta bort gravstenarna till kanterna av gamla stans kyrkogårdar, återbegrava kropparna på annat håll och förvandla kyrkogårdarna till trädgårdar och öppna ytor, istället för att bygga på dem. Detta land i centrala London var mycket värdefullt och spekulanter var ivriga att få det: Även kväkarna hade byggt över en av sina kyrkogårdar och hotade att göra det igen genom att bygga över Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill hade ett nätverk av allierade i ett dussin fält, så hennes hjälp att rädda kyrkan Bottom Wood måste ha varit ovärderlig.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, som inrättades 1882, hade lagt ut cirka två hundra små trädgårdar i stadens centrum av 1890. De senare överlämnade dem till de lokala myndigheterna, så deras stöd för Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal var säker från början.<br/><br/>Kyrle Society är bortglömt nu, men hade på sin tid stort inflytande på stadsplanering och Open Space-lagstiftning. Sällskapet hade omkring 1875 tillsatts 'Skönhetens Spridning', för att bringa färg och intresse in i livet för människor, som bodde i tråkiga, trista omgivningar. ljusa färger till väggar och dekoration, god sång, öppna ytor, natur, litteratur och konst. Det fanns en dekorativ gren, för vilken William Morris föreläste; en musikalisk gren för att främja körer och Happy Evenings för människor i lokala skolbyggnader; och en litteraturgren. Sällskapet vädjade regelbundet genom brev i The Times till "de rikare klasserna" om att böcker och tidskrifter skulle distribueras till pojk- och flickklubbar, allmogehus och annorstädes. Själva namnet "Kyrle" kom från Pope's The Man of Ross, filantropen som gav sin födelseplats till folket som en offentlig park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Med Thanksgiving runt hörnet, här är några festliga filmappsspel som vi gjorde för tjejerna. Båda Thanksgiving-spelen fokuserar på matematiska färdigheter. Och jag är tacksam än en gång till min man, Ed, för att göra all clipart för mig.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Mönster Making<br/><br/>Som namnet säger handlar det här spelet om att göra mönster. Små som bara lär sig om mönster kan helt enkelt matcha bilderna på mönsterremsorna, medan andra kan fortsätta mönstret med bildkorten på de tomma remsorna.<br/><br/>För att göra filmappen vill du klippa ut rutnätet av bilder för att göra kortbitarna. Jag rekommenderar att laminering dem för att hjälpa dem att hålla längre. Lim sedan mönstret remsor ner på filmappen.<br/><br/>Jag ville också ha de tomma mönsterremsorna så att tjejerna kunde se var de skulle fortsätta mönstret och hur många som skulle lägga ut. Jag fäste dem på sidan av mappen med hjälp av tejp så att de kunde vika in för att packa upp spelet och utöka till layout mönstret.<br/><br/>Jag lade också till en extra tom så att tjejerna kunde göra sitt eget mönster också.<br/><br/>Turkiet Antal spel<br/><br/>I det här spelet lägger tjejerna till fjädrarna till kalkonkroppen medan de övar räkning och nummerigenkänning. Jag använde de färglösa fjädrarna för att fungera som en guide för var man ska lägga till fjädrarna och så att tjejerna kunde matcha siffrorna. Och var noga med att när du limmar ner kalkonkroppen limmar du bara i mitten så att vingbitarna kan glida under kroppen.<br/><br/>När alla fjädrar är utlagda, övar vi lite enkel aritmetik, till exempel att ta bort tre fjädrar och se hur många som är kvar och sedan lägga till två tillbaka för att se vad det motsvarar.<br/><br/>Förutom svarta och vita vingar inkluderade vi också en färglös kalkon om du vill ha de små färga sin egen uppsättning. Istället för ett filmappsspel kan du förvandla detta till ett hantverk, färga bitarna, klippa ut dem och limma ihop dem.<br/><br/>Ett annat alternativ är att använda bitarna för att göra en filtbrädehistoria. Vi sjunger ibland en kalkonversion av 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Så här:<br/><br/>Vem är jag?<br/><br/>Jag tror att det är här jag ska säga något kvickt om mig själv. Åh ja. Jag är en stay-at-home mamma till tre fantastiska barn - våra tvillingdöttrar som är sju nu och en tvåårig son som är full av energi. I min pre-barn liv jag var lärare och jag nu homeschool våra barn. Jag är också gift med Ed, som för närvarande tjänstgör i flygvapnet, och är kärleken i mitt liv (det skulle vara besvärligt om han inte var). Vår familj är stor på böcker, hantverk och ha kul tillsammans. Jag tänkte bara att jag skulle dela våra aktiviteter i mitt eget lilla hörn av internet.<br/><br/>Zoe verkar ha allt - rik, stilig man, lätt New York liv - men hon gjorde misstag i sitt förflutna och de misstagen kommer tillbaka i sitt nya liv. Jag befann mig på kanten av min plats för det mesta av boken och blev förvånad ...<br/><br/>Jag älskade den här boken, jag älskar historien, och jag är tacksam Margot Shetterly förde den i ljuset. Mitt enda klagomål var att jag önskade att hon diskuterade Katherine Johnsons roll i de senare uppdragen lite mer men jag antar att historien måste sluta som ...<br/><br/>Jag ville gilla den här boken och jag gjorde under det mesta av det. Dana får reda på att hennes frånskilda man och hans flickvän hittas döda i New Mexico-öknen. Jag blev omedelbart indragen av hennes karaktär och historien. Jag njöt verkligen av seei ... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkoholanvändning av personer under 21 år har identifierats som ett stort folkhälsoproblem. Studier noterar att det ökar riskerna för funktionshinder och kan vara skadligt för hjärnans utveckling. Minderåriga som dricker är mer benägna att begå självmord, bryta mot lagen eller bli offer för våld. Alkohol är inblandad i nästan en tredjedel av ungdomarnas dödsolyckor. Den totala årliga kostnaden för minderårigt drickande uppskattas till 62 miljarder dollar. Medan de flesta lagar som är avsedda att förhindra minderåriga dricker passeras på statlig nivå, har det funnits lagstiftningsverksamhet och intresse på federal nivå för att stödja staternas ansträngningar för att stävja problemet. Denna rapport beskriver omfattningen av minderårigt alkoholmissbruk, den senaste lagstiftningsaktiviteten i denna fråga och olika politiska konsekvenser. Den kommer att uppdateras när nya data blir tillgängliga. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite. The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

Det var inte politisk lobbying eller offentliga framställningar som resulterade i matreform, utan snarare en gräsrotssatsning ledd av medborgare med befogenhet att faktiskt genomföra och följa upp med förändring.<br/><br/>Jag avslutade inlägget med en fråga: Varför är det så svårt för oss att göra detta själva, som individer? Om ett helt land kan genomföra och sprida en gemensam syn på mat, varför kan vi inte?<br/><br/>Det finns inget som hindrar oss från att efterlikna Danmarks framgång. Problemet är att vi är översvämmade med så många meddelanden om vad vi ska äta, och hur vi ska leva, det är svårt att veta var man ska börja. Så i stället för att följa framgångsrika ramar som har visat sig fungera (som Nordic Food Manifesto), hoppar de flesta från diet vurm till diet vurm, försöker hitta "rätt sätt att äta".<br/><br/>Men hur lyckades Claus Meyer? Vad var den hemliga såsen som hjälpte Manifestet att ta tag i? Och är det rimligt att tro att vi kan tillämpa dessa lektioner i våra egna liv?

Köttets unika yttre krispighet gav plats för en perfekt saftig interiör, vilket resulterade i ett ljud som mer liknar skivning i en calzone än en köttfärs.<br/><br/>Vi satt i Köpenhamns äldsta pub, som kändes mer som en avslappnad bistro än en bar, och jag var på väg att prova den maträtt som rekommenderas av vår servitris/bar anbud/ägare?<br/><br/>»Parisnötköttet, det är mycket gott», hade hon sagt. »Det är inte från Frankrike... det är mycket danskt.»<br/><br/>Anmäl dig!<br/><br/>Paris nötkött med färska grönsaker och rå äggula på Rabes Have i Köpenhamn |
