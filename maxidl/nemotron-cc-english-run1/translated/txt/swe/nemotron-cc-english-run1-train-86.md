| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Den historiska stadsdelen Leclaire, en gång kallad Edwardsvilles "förort i söder", grundades som ett kooperativt samhälle 1890 och förblev en separat by tills den annekterades av staden Edwardsville 1934. Tidningar och tidskrifter i hela USA och Europa rapporterade om Leclaire-experimentet, särskilt under de första 20 åren av dess existens. År 1979, på grund av sin unika historia, var den tidigare byn listad på National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire grundades av Nelson Oliver Nelson, en St. Louis VVS-tillverkare som under många år försökte främja arbetarklassens situation. Nelson ville förbättra arbetsvillkoren för sina anställda och tillhandahålla bostäder nära fabrikerna så att arbetare och deras familjer enkelt kunde delta i fritids- och utbildningsprogram som erbjuds gratis av företaget. Före 1890, medan han fortfarande var i St. Louis, började N. O. Nelson Companys tillverknings- och distributionsföretag ge vinstdelning tillsammans med utbildnings- och rekreationsmöjligheter. Det kooperativa experimentet i Leclaire skulle medföra ytterligare fördelar.<br/><br/>När Nelson-anställda angav att de ville flytta till en lantlig plats, kontaktade företagsrepresentanter ledare för små städer i flera Missouri och Illinois-samhällen nära deras St. Louis-högkvarter. De letade efter en lämplig fastighet för att bygga nya fabriker och en modellby. Söder om Edwardsville hittade de en 125 hektar stor mark med tillgång till vatten, kol och transport. Lokala affärsmän agerade snabbt för att erbjuda ett ekonomiskt incitament. På mindre än tre veckor samlade samhället in en fond på 20 000 dollar från individuella bidrag på mellan 1 och 1 000 dollar för att locka Nelson att välja Edwardsville för sitt företag.<br/><br/>Stadens ledare hade hoppats att hitta egendom inom Edwardsvilles stadsgräns, men när ingen lämplig plats kunde hittas var de övertygade om att Nelson-investeringen söder om staden snart skulle bli en del av Edwardsville. Även om Nelson uppfyllde alla villkor för byggande och skapande av arbetstillfällen i sitt kontrakt, skulle det vara 44 år före annekteringen till Edwardsville. Leclaire, avgränsad av Madison / Brown Avenues i öster, järnvägsspåren i väster, Hadley / McKinley Avenues i söder och Wolf Street i norr, förblev en självständig by från 1890 till 1934. Under den tiden fick det ett rykte för innovationer inom näringsliv, utbildning och bostadsplanering.<br/><br/>Byn Leclaire på en karta över Edwardsville från 1931<br/>Följ Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsons beslut att bygga en by fattades inte på ett infall. I slutet av 1880-talet var han en internationell ledare inom samarbete och vinstdelning, utbyta sociala teorier med andra runt om i världen samtidigt som han expanderade sin St. Louis-verksamhet. Han namngav sin experimentby efter den parisiske vinstmakaren Edme Jean Leclaire, men han besökte många andra samhällsvisionärer som gav information och inspiration. Genom att sammanställa de bästa idéerna från dessa exempel grundade Nelson Leclaire för att, med sina ord, "ge arbete, främja intelligens, tillhandahålla rekreation, främja skönhet och göra hem." Senare författare använde dessa ord för att formulera Leclaires grundprinciper: Arbete, hem, utbildning, rekreation och skönhet, men med den ytterligare viktiga principen om frihet.<br/><br/>Arbete<br/><br/>Arbete kan anses vara den viktigaste av dessa faktorer eftersom utan fabriksjobben i Leclaire skulle det inte finnas någon by. Tegelfabriksbyggnaderna ritades av arkitekten E. A. Cameron för att ge naturligt ljus, ventilation på sommaren och golvvärme på vintern. Det fanns ett brandbekämpningssystem och även om industriolyckor inte eliminerades gjordes alla ansträngningar för att garantera arbetarnas säkerhet. De murgröna täckta tegelbyggnaderna var omgivna av välskötta gräsmattor och blomsterträdgårdar som gav komplexet ett campusliknande utseende. 1894 kallade New York World reporter Nellie Bly byggnaderna "den perfekta perfektionen av byggnader för människan att arbeta i".<br/><br/>Tillverkningskomplexet för N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company i Leclaire<br/>Från Leclaires vänner<br/><br/>Nelsons företagspolicy var utformad för att skydda de anställdas finansiella stabilitet. Arbetare kunde tjäna en del av vinsten och ha en röst i företaget om de valde det alternativet. Vinstdelningsplanen gav Nelson-anställda en stolthet av ägande som resulterade i en stödjande arbetskraft. Det fanns några kortlivade arbetsstrejker under åren, men för det mesta var arbetsproblem sällsynta. Arbetstagare hade också rimliga timmar och konkurrenskraftiga löner. Det fanns en försynsfond som tillhandahöll pensioner och sjukskrivningar samt änkepensioner om en arbetstagare dog, oavsett om dödsfallet var relaterat till hans anställning.<br/><br/>Företagets huvudkontor för N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) var kvar i St. Louis, men hela N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company flyttades till Leclaire. Tillverkningsföretaget var uppdelat i butiker som gjorde en mängd olika produkter. År 1900 blev butikerna självständiga företag för skatteändamål, men alla ägdes fortfarande av N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Butikerna inkluderade Cabinet Mill där träprodukter från skåp till kvarnverk producerades. De skickliga hantverkare som arbetade här uppfyllde också särskilda kontrakt, inklusive kassörsburar för en lokal bank och ett altare som fortfarande används vid St Andrew's Episcopal Church i Edwardsville. Marble Shop specialiserade sig på arkitektonisk marmor som klipptes och installerades av Nelson besättningar i hem, företag och till och med statliga kapitäler i hela Mellanvästern. The Machine Shop, som blev Bignall och Keeler, gjorde rörmonteringsmaskiner, pumpar, mätare och olika mekaniska verktyg som förväntas i VVS-handeln. De förgrenade sig också för att tillverka specialartiklar som Leclaire-cykeln i mitten av 1890-talet. I Mässingsaffären ingick ett gjuteri där olika rör och verktyg tillverkades. Dessa exempel representerar bara en del av det arbete som utfördes i Leclaire-fabrikerna. Företagets logotyp var en stiliserad "NONCO" som fortfarande kan ses på VVS-armaturer och några brandposter i Edwardsville idag.<br/><br/>Bostäder<br/><br/>Innan bostäder kunde byggas behövdes bostäder för arbetare som slutförde fabriksbyggnaderna samt byggde bostäder. För att möta dessa behov byggde företaget "Club House", en stor byggnad som tjänade många ändamål. Förutom logi var det samhällets första utbildningsbyggnad, och den innehöll ett välfyllt bibliotek.<br/><br/>Byggandet av bostadsdelen Leclaire började omedelbart efter att byn grundades i juni 1890. Julius Pitzman, den innovativa landskapsarkitekten som lade ut de första partierna i Leclaire, satte upp dem med ett antal skyddande förbund. Förbundet föreskrev breda, krökta gator, stora partier och en handlingsbegränsning som begränsade fastigheterna till bostads- eller utbildningsändamål. Företaget banade gatorna, tillhandahöll elektriska gatubelysning, installerade trottoarer och planterade hundratals träd längs Leclaires gator. Senare sektioner av Leclaire lades ut med en konventionell rutnätsdesign och mindre partier, men inkluderade fortfarande dådets begränsningar.<br/><br/>En Leclaire viktorianska stuga i 1907<br/>Följ Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inledningsvis byggdes bostäderna av företaget och såldes sedan till nära kostnad till Nelson-anställda för att uppmuntra hemägande. Om en arbetare blev sjuk och inte kunde göra sin inteckning, avbröts betalningar tills han återvände till jobbet. Bostäderna erbjöds i en mängd olika husdesigner och företaget annonserade att inga två bostäder var likadana. De tidigaste bostäderna var främst viktorianska stugor som kom med el och rinnande vatten. Dessa följdes av bungalows, fyrkanter och till och med några kithem. Invånarna kunde köpa ett företagsbyggt hem eller köpa en tom tomt och bygga ett hus själva, förutsatt att den arkitektoniska designen uppfyllde företagets standarder.<br/><br/>Under senare år såldes partier till investerare, vanligtvis Edwardsville invånare, och många bostäder på 1920-talet byggdes av lokala entreprenörer som sedan sålde dem till områdets invånare.<br/><br/>Utbildning<br/><br/>Nelson trodde på utbildning för alla, inklusive arbetarklassen. Utbildningsprogram började med en dagis i klubbhuset 1892 och fortsatte i den nya utbildningsbyggnaden på 722 Holyoake Road. Vanligtvis kallas "School House", denna byggnad gav en stor hall för möten och program, men hade rörliga partitioner för att dela upp den i klassrummet under dagen. På kvällarna var det danser, möten eller program i Leclaire Self-Culture Club som innehöll veckovisa föreläsningar av Washington University professorer eller nationellt kända talare som, som N. O. Nelson, var en del av den sociala förbättringsrörelsen vid sekelskiftet. Bland dessa fanns Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, och författaren Charlotte Perkins Gilman, bland andra.<br/><br/>Barn inskrivna i Leclaire dagis 1913<br/>Följ Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Under de tio åren efter 1895 års konstruktion av utbildningsbyggnaden fanns en rad pedagogiska experiment, inklusive en industriskola, högskola, nattskola och en akademi. Den tidigaste och mest långlivade satsningen var morgondagiset, grundat 1892, som använde Fröbelmodellen. Detta tvååriga program var gratis för alla, inklusive Edwardsville barn, fram till 1931 när företaget av ekonomiska skäl började ta ut undervisning till studenter som inte var barn till anställda. Nelson Manufacturing drev ett dagis fram till 1934 då byggnaden lämnades över till Edwardsville School District för en nominell avgift.<br/><br/>Rekreation<br/><br/>Båtägare på Leclaire Lake 1915<br/>Följ Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreation var ett viktigt inslag i Leclaire. Företaget tillhandahöll idrottsanläggningar för baseboll, tennis och senare fotboll. En bowling- och biljardhall byggdes och det fanns en sjö för båtliv, simning, fiske eller skridskoåkning på vintern. Leclaire Park var möblerad med båthus, manliga och kvinnliga badhus och en stor paviljong. Invånarna organiserade danser, hayrides, stavning bin och andra aktiviteter, och företaget sponsrade ett band som spelade regelbundet på nöjen i byn eller i Edwardsville. Liksom de pedagogiska funktionerna på klubbhuset och skolhuset var fritidsanläggningarna på Leclaire öppna för alla och var ofta en destination för Edwardsville och till och med St. Louis besökare.<br/><br/>Skönhet<br/><br/>Bilder från Leclaire Lake<br/>Följ Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Den sista av de faktorer Nelson ansåg viktiga för ett tillfredsställande liv gällde miljön. Nelson visste om vikten av ett hälsosamt liv. Han värderade den skönhet och renlighet, som kunde finnas på landet, och uppmuntrade alla i Leclaire att försköna sin egendom genom att plantera trädgårdar och fruktträdgårdar. Nelson själv ledde med exempel, så ett företagsväxthus gav gratis blommor och tävlingar hölls för de vackraste varven. Leclaire lades ut så att hela byn hade en parkliknande miljö som fortfarande är tydlig idag.<br/><br/>Frihet<br/><br/>Leclaire Cooperative-butiken<br/>Följ Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listade fem grundläggande principer för Leclaire, men moderna författare lägger till en sjätte: Frihet. Alla de program som företaget erbjöd var tillgängliga för anställda såväl som lokala invånare, men ingen var obligatorisk. Friheten att välja om man skulle delta i företagsprogrammen var helt upp till individen. Invånarna i Leclaire kunde arbeta för Nelson Manufacturing eller någon annanstans, och arbetarna var inte skyldiga att bo i Leclaire. Deltagande i fritids- och utbildningsprogram var också valfritt. Det fanns också en företagsbutik där anställda kunde handla, men till skillnad från andra företagsstäder var ingen skyldig till företagsbutiken. Leclaire Store var ett kooperativ där medlemmarna debiterades rättvisa marknadspriser, men sedan betalades kvartalsvisa utdelningar.<br/><br/>En annan företagsstad<br/><br/>Alla dessa fördelar gjorde Leclaire unikt från andra företagsstäder. Men det fanns också enskilda fall där företaget visade medkänsla och omsorg för de anställda. Företaget stängde fabrikerna och hyrde utflyktståg för att ta arbetare och deras familjer till St. Louis för en dag på 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. När det var ont om pengar brukade Nelson då och då lägga extra pengar i varje lönekuvert för att göra livet lättare för arbetarna, och om han instiftade ett program som männen inte höll med om, pratade de ut det och så ofta som inte, skulle Nelson vända sig själv.<br/><br/>Född i Lillesand, Norge, 1841, N. O. Nelson var en komplicerad man. Han var en kapitalist som trodde på fritt företagande, men också en socialist, en anhängare av "Golden Rule", och en patriot som tjänstgjorde för unionen i inbördeskriget. År 1900 var han mångmiljonär, men vid tiden för sin död 1922 hade han gett bort allt för att förbättra arbetarklassen.<br/><br/>Även om Leclaire inte var Nelsons enda sociala experiment, anses det vara hans mest framgångsrika strävan. Andra stora insatser för social förbättring inkluderade en kedja av kooperativa livsmedelsbutiker i New Orleans, en dagis för barnen till svarta anställda i hans Bessemer, Alabama, fabriker och ett hem för konsumtionsvaror i Indio, Kalifornien.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire var internationellt känt som ett anmärkningsvärt och framgångsrikt experiment. Det beskrevs i New York World vid ett flertal tillfällen men i synnerhet av reportern Nellie Bly 1894 som skrev utförligt om modellstaden där "arbetsfrågan är löst och alla glada i en liten by nära St. Louis." Los Angeles Times rapporterade också regelbundet om N. O. Nelson, liksom Chicago Daily Tribune och många andra publikationer.<br/><br/>I ett tal vid Leclaires 15-årsjubileum 1915 sa Nelson, "Leclaire sträcker sig till dig en bred öppen gästfrihet och bjuder dig att njuta av idag den lätthet och komfort och skönhet och inspiration som vi njuter av varje dag." Mer än ett sekel har gått sedan den dagen, men inbjudan gäller fortfarande. Invånare och forskare uppmanas att lära sig om Leclaires historia och överväga de lärdomar som kan läras för att förbättra framtida generationer.<br/><br/>En av de tidigare byggnaderna i tillverkningskomplexet 2019, som nu fungerar som N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Författarbesök via Zoom eller Skype<br/><br/>Jag ser fram emot att träffa dina elever via Zoom eller Skype! Skype är ett utmärkt alternativ för skolor/klasser som inte tar in författare i person, men som vill utforska böcker och poesi, få kontakt med en författare och ställa en-mot-en-frågor.<br/><br/>Kostnad<br/><br/>Jag erbjuder 30-45 minuters Zoom- eller Skype-besök med skolor för 125 dollar per session (eller 200 dollar för två sessioner som händer inom tre timmar på morgonen eller eftermiddagen; 325 dollar för tre sessioner på en dag; 425 dollar för fyra sessioner på en dag). I varje session försöker jag få barnen så aktivt involverade som möjligt. Nej, det är inte samma typ av anslutning som ett personligt besök erbjuder, men det kan fortfarande vara inspirerande och motiverande för barn!<br/><br/>Vad jag gör<br/><br/>Varje session för upp till 50 studenter inkluderar:<br/><br/>5 minuter av tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segment av 10ish-minuter vardera - Du väljer mellan:<br/><br/>Hur jag blev författare<br/><br/>Skriver den här boken (du väljer vilken bok jag fokuserar på)<br/><br/>Läser (läser några dikter och barn hjälper mig att läsa andra)<br/><br/>Klassrumspresentation (dina elever sätter på en läsning eller föreställning för mig - en mycket uppskattande publik!)<br/><br/>Att skriva en dikt tillsammans<br/><br/>Fråge- och svarssession<br/><br/>5 minuter av wrap-ups / farväl<br/><br/>Jag chattar också med klasser av pre-service lärare eller grupper av in-service lärare om poesi och skrivande.<br/><br/>Tips för ett stort virtuellt besök<br/><br/>Tips för ett lyckat virtuellt besök<br/><br/>Ett av mina mål för virtuella skolbesök är att fånga den interaktivitet som gör personliga besök framgångsrika och roliga. Men sanningen är att det ibland är svårt att vara praktiskt taget interaktiv! Timingen kanske inte synkroniseras korrekt, vilket gör läsning tillsammans en utmaning, och det är verkligen svårt för mig att höra enskilda elever om de inte kommer upp och talar direkt i mikrofonen / datorn. Men efter lite trial and error har jag upptäckt några sätt att få bästa möjliga virtuella besök. Här är de: 10 sätt att göra mitt besök med dina elever en bra upplevelse!<br/><br/>Före besöket<br/><br/>Få barnen så glada som möjligt om besöket. Besök min hemsida med dem. Läs några av mina böcker med dem. Samla några frågor studenter har för mig. Allt du gör i förväg för att få det att kännas som en stor deal kommer att gå långt mot studentengagemang.<br/><br/>Placera videokameran eller den bärbara datorn med webbkamera så att jag kan se så mycket av publiken som möjligt. Det är svårt att bedöma elevernas engagemang när jag bara kan se ett par studenter.<br/><br/>Begränsa varje grupp till 50 elever. Det är otroligt svårt att engagera stora grupper via video.<br/><br/>Jag går snabbt från ämne till ämne eller dikt till dikt. Påminn eleverna om att de måste lyssna noga för att förstå vad som händer.<br/><br/>Ibland gör jag en liten Reader's Theater med studenter. Om jag skickar dig några skriptade studentdelar i förväg, skriv ut en kopia för varje session och skär i bitar, om det behövs.<br/><br/>Under besöket<br/><br/>När jag diskuterar en bok, om du har den tryckta boken, vänligen håll upp den för eleverna att se.<br/><br/>Du är min proxy. Jag kan ofta inte ringa elever och höra enskilda svar. Så jag kanske säger, "Vi kommer att få 3 idéer. Höj handen om du har en idé." Sedan tar DU över, kallar på tre elever och meddelar dessa svar till alla i rummet och till mig.<br/><br/>Välj självsäkra, utgående studenter för skriptade studentdelar (om jag skickar några i förväg). Under mina personliga skolbesök försöker jag dra ut några av de mindre självsäkra eleverna, men jag har funnit att det inte fungerar lika bra under virtuella besök eftersom jag inte kan höra dem.<br/><br/>Låt elever med talande delar sitta på framsidan. När det är dags, få dem att stå upp och påminna dem om att tala högt.<br/><br/>I virtuella besök faller beteendehantering enbart på dig. Jag kan ofta inte se exakt vad som händer, så snälla gå in efter behov. Om det är en stor störning, bara be mig att hålla på ett ögonblick så att jag inte chattar på medan ingen uppmärksammar:>)<br/><br/>Känn dig fri att ta bilder av mig på skärmen och dela på sociala medier - även om bilder av mig ofta ser löjliga ut eftersom jag gör roliga ansikten eller något medan jag läser!<br/><br/>Om du har några frågor alls, fråga bara, antingen före eller under besöket!<br/><br/>Planera en virtuell session<br/><br/>Är du intresserad av att boka ett virtuellt besök med mig? Bara maila mig för att ställa in ett datum, så går vi därifrån |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Nyhetsarkiv<br/><br/>Ny bok ser på sätt att ta itu med hiv-utmaningar<br/><br/>Maj : 29/11/2018<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis med Marjorie Human som designade omslaget till boken, Agera på HIV.<br/><br/>HIV-pandemin har tagit fram det bästa och värsta hos människor när det gäller respons. Å ena sidan har det lett till stigmatisering och våld och å andra sidan har det lett till konstruktiva och stödjande svar från olika individer och grupper. En ny bok, Acting on HIV, redigerad av Prof. Dennis Francis, dekan vid utbildningsfakulteten vid Fristatens universitet, tittar på hur drama kan användas för att främja vital social förändring samt individuell beteendeförändring.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV erbjuder en systematisk undersökning av drama som ett sätt att diskutera hiv/aids och relaterade attityder och beteenden. Boken är en vetenskaplig text och innehåller arbete av ett tjugotal exceptionellt kreativa författare. Bidragande författare till boken är bland andra Proff Hazel Barnes (Witwatersrands universitet), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) och Yvonne Sliep från University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Detta projekt startade 2009 och har tagit mycket av min tid för att samla arbetet med exceptionellt kreativa författare. Den forskning som kommuniceras genom boken är originell och aktuell och ger ett betydande bidrag till samtal om dramats roll och betydelse för att ta itu med frågor om hiv och aids, säger Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Sedan Lara Crofts första videospelframträdande i Tomb Raider (1996) har hennes bedrifter som en äventyrlig och kvicktänkt upptäcktsresande resonerat brett med spelare och tjänat henne en plats i pantheonen av stora popkulturkaraktärer. Av den anledningen kommer vi att sätta The World of Lara Croft i Storyworld Spotlight från 22 december 2021 till 6 mars 2022.<br/><br/>Göra en Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft skapades av studion Core Design, i Derby (Storbritannien), 1996. Studion letade efter en huvudperson för deras kommande ett 3D-äventyrsspel för PlayStation 1. Ett spel i ett 3: e personperspektiv där spelarna skulle se huvudpersonen i sin helhet genom varje scen.<br/><br/>Eftersom spelet handlade om att "raida mystiska gravar djupt under pyramiderna", skulle huvudpersonen behöva se äventyrlig ut och ha hjärnan för att överleva komplexa raiduppdrag. Efter lite överläggning föddes Lara Croft, en ung, överklass och helt brittisk kvinna, som var lika gåtfull och intelligent som hon var tuff och självförsörjande.<br/><br/>Framgång och kontrovers<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) var en utbrytarsuccé för Core Design, som snabbt dubblerade ner på att bygga Tomb Raider 2 (1997) och 3 (1998). En stor del av framgången tillskrevs spelens ledande dam, som fann beundrare både med manliga och kvinnliga spelare. Detta förbryllade kritiker som bara såg Lara Croft som en sexistisk tecknad film.<br/><br/>Utforska världen av Lara Croft i Storyworld<br/><br/>Den här utställningen utforskar den framgångsrika franchisen på djupet. Den tittar på spelens historia och varför dess ledande dam resonerar med så många människor. Det dyker också in i mysteriet med vad som gör Tomb Raider-spel, från den djupa världsbyggnaden till de smarta pussel och fällor, och från fantastiska fiende- och monsterdesigner till karaktärsdesignen av den legendariska hjältinnan.<br/><br/>Mysterier är där för att utforska, och har varit under de senaste 25 åren.<br/><br/>Biljetter<br/><br/>Köp dina biljetter till Storyworld online med startdatum och starttid från onsdag 22 december.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Fastighetsord för dagen: Alternativ<br/><br/>Alternativ: Ett avtal om att hålla öppet, under en viss period, ett erbjudande om att sälja eller hyra fast egendom. Ett alternativ kan till exempel användas för att ge köparen tid att lösa frågor om finansiering, titel, zonindelning och genomförbarhet innan köparen förbinder sig att köpa. Alternativ används ofta i markmonteringsprocessen. Optionen måste stödjas av dess faktiska ersättning, separat och oberoende av köpeskillingen för fastigheten. Enbart skälet till övervägandet är inte tillräckligt, utom i ett leasingalternativ där bestämmelserna i leasingavtalet i sig är tillräckligt övervägande för att stödja alternativet. Ett alternativ skapar bara en avtalsenlig rätt; det ger inte optionen någon egendom i fastigheten. Vid den tidpunkt då optionen undertecknas säljer ägaren inte, inte heller köparen köper fastigheten. Även om ägaren är skyldig att sälja om det meddelas av köparen, är köparen inte skyldig att köpa. En option att köpa är också känd som ett samtal; en option att sälja är känd som en put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Fördelar med karotenoider för huden<br/><br/>Har du hört talas om karotenoider? Dessa kraftfulla fytokemikalier är de pigmenterade beståndsdelarna som finns i växter som ger blommor, frukter och lämnar sina gula, orange och röda färger.<br/><br/>Sedan 1930-talet har forskare identifierat cirka 800 karotenoider och cirka 40 finns i människokroppen, inklusive det yttersta lagret av epidermis, dermis och subkutant fett. De vanligaste karotenoider är beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaxanthin, lykopen och astaxanthin. Du kan läsa mer om astaxanthin här.<br/><br/>Innehållet av karotenoider i huden påverkas av många faktorer, inklusive intag av frukt och grönsaker, deras biotillgänglighet från olika livsmedel, tillskott, exponering för UV-strålning, luftföroreningar, alkoholkonsumtion, rökning och stress.<br/><br/>Hur hjälper karotenoider min hud?<br/><br/>Karotenoider är några av de mest kända antioxidanterna för huden och de har också viktiga funktioner som antiinflammatoriska medel.<br/><br/>Hälsosam åldrande och hudreparation<br/><br/>Antioxidanter är viktiga för frisk hud eftersom de hjälper till att förhindra fria radikaler skador på celler. Fria radikaler skador orsakar för tidigt åldrande och uppkomsten av olika typer av hudcancer. Karotenoider, tillsammans med vitamin E, vitamin C och Co-enzym Q10 är viktiga dermala antioxidanter.<br/><br/>På grund av deras antioxidantaktivitet stöder och uppmuntrar karotenoider kollagen- och elastinproduktionen i huden. Detta bidrar till att öka hudens densitet, tjocklek, elasticitet och fasthet. Kollagen och elastin minskar när vi åldras, så att få tillräckligt med karotenoider i kosten och topiskt är avgörande för åldrande väl.<br/><br/>Karotenoider kan förbättra tecknen på fotoåldrande, missfärgning av huden, elasticitet, hydrering, textur och kan minska transepidermal vattenförlust.<br/><br/>Astaxantin i synnerhet stimulerar fibroblaster att producera kollagen och elastin, hämmar aktiviteten hos de enzymer som bryter ner kollagen och elastin, och visar antiinflammatoriska och UV-filtrerande effekter. Det har visat sig minska melanin i huden, vilket resulterar i en minskning av uppkomsten av fräknar och melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-akneaktivitet: karotenoiders antiinflammatoriska aktivitet hjälper till att dämpa inflammation och irritation i samband med akne. Karotenoider hjälper också till att normalisera och balansera oljeutsöndringar från talgkörtlarna. De är värdefulla medel i hudreparation och de stimulerar epidermal regenerering, vilket hjälper till att släta ut och mjuka upp huden.<br/><br/>Var kan jag hitta karotenoider?<br/><br/>Det finns två sätt att få din dagliga dos av karotenoider: genom kost och genom topisk applicering. Kombinationen av båda är det perfekta sättet att åldras hudvård.<br/><br/>Karotenoider är fettlösliga, så din kropp behöver fett för att absorbera dem (tänk tomater och olivolja, broccoli och smör, eller spenat och avokado). Vanliga källor till karotenoider i mat är avokado, äggulor, grönkål, spenat, morötter, sötpotatis, papaya och tomater.<br/><br/>Medan vi förespråkar att få så många av dina näringsämnen och antioxidanter som möjligt från mat snarare än tillskott, visade en studie att astaxanthin kombinerat med kollagenhydrolysat signifikant förbättrade barriärintegriteten, minskade transepidermal vattenförlust och ökade uttrycket av prokollagen typ I mRNA.<br/><br/>Aktuell applicering är nyckeln till frisk hud. Studier visar att höga koncentrationer av antioxidanter i mänsklig hud ger det bästa skyddet för frisk hud i alla åldrar.<br/><br/>På Sarka Botanicals blandar vi karotenoidrika, hela växter som calendula, maskros och extrakt som astaxantin med kallpressade oljor och funktionella ingredienser. Calendula ensam innehåller över 19 olika typer av karotenoider. Detta kan förklara varför det har en så lång historia av användning i hudvård. Studier visar att karotenoider blandas med koenzym Q10 är särskilt effektiva för att minska inflammation och bromsa för tidigt hudåldrande på grund av solexponering. |
