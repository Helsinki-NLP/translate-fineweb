| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | För fyrtionio år sedan undertecknade president Lyndon B. Johnson rösträttslagen från 1965.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>För nästan ett sekel sedan fastslog det 15: e tillägget till konstitutionen: "Rätten för medborgare i Förenta staterna att rösta får inte nekas eller förkortas av Förenta staterna eller av någon stat på grund av ras, färg eller tidigare villkor för slaveri." Och nästan ett sekel innan dess satte vår nations grundare igång det stora experimentet med amerikansk demokrati genom att förklara att "alla män är skapade lika".<br/><br/>Rösträttslagen från 1965 var ett sent erkännande att även i Amerika har våra grundläggande ideal liten vikt om de inte skyddas av rättsstatsprincipen. Det är därför avsnitt 2 i det 15: e ändringsförslaget gav kongressen "makt att genomdriva denna artikel genom lämplig lagstiftning."<br/><br/>Och faktiskt kunde det kodifierade språket i rösträttslagen uppnå vad Reconstruction-era-kongressen och Thomas Jefferson inte kunde. Civil Rights Act från 1964 och Voting Rights Act - och medborgarrättsrörelsen från vilken de uppstod - tjänade som katalysator för en dramatisk ökning av möjligheten för svarta amerikaner att delta i den demokratiska processen.<br/><br/>Till exempel var endast 6,7 procent av de svarta Mississippianerna registrerade för att rösta 1962; 1969 hade den siffran nått 66,5 procent. Idag har Mississippi fler svarta valda tjänstemän än någon annan stat.<br/><br/>De skydd som infördes genom rösträttslagen var länge försenade när de antogs, representativa för den svåra kamp med vilken de uppnåddes. Men otänkbart är att dessa skydd nu är under attack, vilket äventyrar de framsteg som vår nation arbetade så hårt för att uppnå.<br/><br/>Förra året, i fallet med Shelby County v. Holder, rensade USA: s högsta domstol en nyckelkomponent i rösträttslagen som möjliggjorde tidigare federal granskning för att säkerställa icke-diskriminering innan någon ny omröstningslag trädde i kraft.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Tyvärr har svaret från republikanska ledare varit att inte göra någonting. Senator Ted Cruz och guvernör Rick Perry gick ut ur deras sätt att berömma högsta domstolens beslut.

Det är oärligt för republikaner som Paul att söka rösterna i dessa samhällen när de tror att "det är inget fel med" att införa begränsningar som gör det svårare för dessa valkretsar att rösta.<br/><br/>Republikaner har också försökt att begränsa förtida omröstningsperioder, inklusive söndagen före valdagen, när afroamerikanska kyrkor har haft stor framgång med Souls till omröstningsprogrammen.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Dessa begränsningar representerar en känslokall ansträngning av republikaner för att göra omröstningen svårare, baserat på smala, kortsiktiga politiska beräkningar att republikanerna kan vinna val genom att krympa storleken på väljarkåren.<br/><br/>Demokrater har ett helt annat uppdrag när det gäller att rösta: att se till att alla röstberättigade kan registrera sig, att varje registrerad väljare kan rösta och att varje röst räknas korrekt.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Den demokratiska nationella kommitténs valutvidgningsprojekt speglar vår tro på att större valdeltagande stärker vår nation och vår demokrati.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Frågor och svar: Vatikanens säkerhetsexpert Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 juni 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Bild: Australiska jesuiter.<br/><br/>Ordföranden för Centre for Child Protection vid Gregorian University i Rom, och en medlem av den påvliga kommissionen för skydd av minderåriga, Hans Zollner SJ, var i Australien 2018 för att tala med katolska departementsledare och överlevande.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh från Jesuit Communications satte sig ner med honom under besöket för att undersöka hur kyrkan svarar på missbrukskrisen internationellt och vad som kan läras av våra erfarenheter i Australien.<br/><br/>MM: Detta är din tredje resa till Australien. Du har besökt en hel del andra länder för att se hur kyrkan svarar på övergrepp runt om i världen. Kan du ge oss en uppfattning om hur den globala bilden ser ut?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Jag förstår, efter att ha besökt cirka 50 länder på fem eller sex kontinenter, att kyrkan verkligen har börjat röra sig under de senaste åren i frågan om att göra rättvisa åt offren, att lyssna på dem och göra vad som kan göras för att skydda dem.<br/><br/>Jag var med jesuitprovinserna från hela Afrika i slutet av april, och presidenten för jesuitassistansen i Afrika och Madagaskar är mycket engagerad och dedikerad till detta. Han har lagt upp en grundlig handlingsplan för bildandet och för att införa riktlinjer överallt. Det är en mycket hänsynsfull och mycket avsiktlig ansträngning att göra vad som kan göras för att vara proaktivt engagerade som jesuiter i Afrika - i en kontinent där fram till för några år sedan allt detta var ett främmande språk.<br/><br/>En av utmaningarna med att försöka utveckla detta globala tillvägagångssätt är att du har att göra med så många kulturer, och så många olika förståelser. Hur förenar ni detta och försöker ge utbildning och stöd till religiösa samfund som tar itu med dessa frågor?<br/><br/>Detta är en av de stora frågorna vi har. Jag tror att det jag kan göra är att stimulera diskussion, stimulera reflektion och förbereda människor så mycket som möjligt så att de kan göra grundarbetet.<br/><br/>Centrum för barnskydd vid Gregorian University låtsas inte ha svaret på varje fråga. Inte bara för att vi inte känner till de specifika sammanhangen - vi kanske känner till några av dem, men vi pratar om tusentals kulturer, vi pratar om hundratals språk, vi pratar om mycket olika juridiska bakgrunder. Det varierar även ibland inom ett land, till exempel Australien där du har stater inom Commonwealth of Australia som har andra lagar än andra stater.<br/><br/>Jag är någon som försöker framkalla och stimulera diskussion och reflektion. Jag är också väldigt glad att lyssna på människor.<br/><br/>Du nämnde behovet av att lyssna och stödja offren i att bli hörda. Vi har uppenbarligen haft den kungliga kommissionen här i Australien, men vad är några av de andra sätten som du har sett att offrens röster stöds runt om i världen?<br/><br/>I Frankrike finns det ett stift som har etablerat vad de kallar "The Listening Space". Där kan offren träda fram och de kan uttrycka sig. Biskopen är närvarande. Det är ett öppet utrymme där människor som har skadats enormt är fria att åtminstone uttrycka vad de vill fråga från kyrkans ledarskap etc.<br/><br/>Det finns andra platser i USA eller i andra länder där offer har bjudits in av stift, av provinser, av kyrkans ledning att träda fram. Jag måste säga att på det hela taget tror jag att det finns en god vilja, och det finns fler människor som biskopar och provinsialer som lyssnar på offren än vi vet. Men det finns ingen modell för att ge offren inte bara utrymme att uttrycka sig och bli lyssnade på, utan också att engagera sig aktivt i kyrkans utveckling.<br/><br/>När det gäller att skapa utrymmen för stöd till offer, vad är några av de saker du har sett som verkligen kan hjälpa - och att vi skulle kunna överväga här i Australien?<br/><br/>En av de viktigaste punkterna som många offer tar upp är, "Kan vi inte ha, inom församlingsinställningar, inom skolinställningar, en vanlig konversation som pågår som inkluderar överlevande av övergrepp som vanliga medlemmar i en kommitté, en kommission, en bollplank, en feedbackgrupp eller något liknande?" Så att denna röst inte bara kommer in vid ett visst tillfälle, eller där en person känner att han eller hon är på en punkt för att kunna tala ut om det, men [hörs] regelbundet - bygg in den rösten i systemet.<br/><br/>Det kommer att hjälpa oss alla. Det kommer att hjälpa överlevande och offer eftersom de kommer att känna sig välkomna och uppskattade i den specifika erfarenheten och i de specifika livsutmaningar som de gick igenom. För det andra kommer det att hjälpa samhället i stort, eftersom vi åtminstone kan göra oss mer och mer lyhörda för vad de överlevandes bekymmer och specifika behov är – som också kan tala till ungdomarnas behov.<br/><br/>M: Vi har starka grupper av överlevande här i Australien som har kunnat stödja varandra genom den processen. Men vad du säger är att vi behöver något sätt att stödja dessa grupper, och stödja dessa människor, genom våra egna institutioner också?<br/><br/>Och jag tror att vi måste vara kreativa. Det kommer att fungera för en skola och en församling och ett stift på ett sätt, och för andra på ett annat sätt. Eftersom de överlevande som jag är i ständig kontakt med, har de ganska liknande önskemål och liknande erfarenheter när det gäller att välkomnas i kyrkan eller inte - känner sig utkastade eller avskedade. Men de har också helt olika förväntningar, så jag har lärt mig att man också måste vara mycket tillmötesgående när det gäller att acceptera skillnaderna i vad den här specifika gruppen, eller den här specifika överlevaren, vill ha, begär och behöver.<br/><br/>M: Överlevande talar om att vilja få sina historier hörda och erkända. Vi har haft den kungliga kommissionen här i Australien, vilket gav en oberoende process där offren kunde komma fram. Finns det ett behov av något sådant när det gäller en sanning, rättvisa och försoningsprocess för kyrkan internationellt?<br/><br/>H: Ja, jag tror att det finns ett behov av det internationellt. Men jag tror att först måste varje lokal kyrka göra sina egna läxor. Jag ser inte att det händer mycket snart att något sådant råd eller kommission skulle inrättas för att undersöka detta område för hela kyrkan. Kyrkan har 1,3 miljarder medlemmar och finns i 190 länder, med alla slags skillnader i förväntningar om psykologiskt, andligt och ekonomiskt stöd.<br/><br/>Det finns en sak som jag har stött på konsekvent i att kommunicera med, arbeta med och lyssna på offer, och det är att de vill bli lyssnade på. Så om det fanns en känsla av att offren ständigt lyssnades på - i Rom och på andra håll - tror jag att det skulle ge en stor lättnad för många offer.<br/><br/>Jag tror [påve Franciskus] oro, särskilt när det gäller er fråga, är att de lokala kyrkorna gör vad de kan för att offren ska bli lyssnade på i just det landet. Jag har en lista över människor som vill prata direkt med den Helige Fadern, och fysiskt är det omöjligt. Jag var där 2014 för att översätta för två tyska överlevande som valdes med två irländska och två engelska överlevande när han fick sex av dem hemma. Han tog hela morgonen att lyssna på dem en efter en. För var och en var han där i 40 till 45 minuter. Om han skulle göra detta för varje överlevande kunde han inte sova längre.<br/><br/>Hans exempel är att modellera för hela den katolska kyrkan hur offer och överlevande tas emot, välkomnas och lyssnas på. Jag tror att om biskoparna och provinserna i denna värld, i alla länder, följde hans exempel, skulle många överlevande verkligen uppskatta det.<br/><br/>Ärkebiskop Diarmud Martin citerades nyligen strax före världsmötet för familjer, om den påvliga kommissionen, som säger att den är för liten eftersom den för närvarande är inrättad för att uppnå vad den behöver uppnå. Vad är din uppfattning om det? Behöver kyrkan lägga mer resurser på hur den övervakar dessa frågor?<br/><br/>För närvarande är vi 16 medlemmar från i princip alla kontinenter, och de stora språkgrupperna. Vi representerar en mängd olika discipliner och yrken, och syftet med kommissionen - som de stadgar som just har utfärdats - är att ge råd till den Helige Fadern.<br/><br/>Ett vanligt missförstånd om kommissionen är först att vi behandlar fall av anklagelser. Så är inte fallet. Vi har ingen juridisk eller administrativ makt när det gäller fall, för när det gäller anklagelser om missbruk ställs tribunaler och förfaranden.<br/><br/>Ett andra missförstånd är att vi främjar, direkt, saker på marken. Vårt första och främsta mål är att vi ger råd till den Helige Fadern i frågor.<br/><br/>Så ja, vi måste investera mer. Men vi måste investera mer på lokal nivå, och vi måste se till att förslagen från den påvliga kommissionen vidarebefordras till den helige fadern – vilket ordföranden normalt gör – och sedan finns det en uppföljningsprocess som återspeglar vad vi har gett som vårt råd.<br/><br/>I Australien övervakar Catholic Professional Standards Limited kyrkans svar och ger riktlinjer och stöd för att säkerställa att alla institutioner i kyrkan är barnsäkra institutioner. Finns det ett behov av någon form av organisatoriskt stöd från Rom för de biskopar och stift som kämpar för att bilda dessa institutioner och ge skydd i dessa stift?<br/><br/>Jag tror att kommissionen i slutändan kommer att utvecklas i den riktningen, de håller nu på att anställa experter inom dessa områden.<br/><br/>Jag tror att kyrkan måste förstå att de lokala kyrkorna kan lära av varandra, och min förståelse har alltid varit – och jag tror att den Helige Fadern har påmint oss – att kyrkan inte kommer att fungera som ett centraliserat företag. Det fungerar inte så effektivt. Varje biskop, varje biskopskonferens, har till viss del sitt liv på egen hand. Vad vi behöver lära oss mer är att öppna kanaler för ömsesidig kommunikation.<br/><br/>Det finns ett antal saker som folk skyller för missbruk i kyrkan. Som präst och psykolog, och som någon som har träffat och arbetat med överlevande, vad är dina tankar om den frågan?<br/><br/>Jag anser att frågan om varifrån övergreppen kommer är den viktigaste, och det har påven tagit upp i sitt brev till Guds folk som publicerades den 20 augusti. Han säger i första stycket, och upprepar det om och om igen, att frågan om sexuella övergrepp alltid är knuten – eller nästan alltid knuten – inte bara till frågan om maktmissbruk, utan också till samvetsmissbruk.<br/><br/>Så den verkliga grundläggande frågan om missbruk är mycket mer komplex än bara [frågan om] sexualitet - vare sig det är heterosexuell eller homosexuell. Det är en maktfråga, och där måste vi verkligen arbeta med frågan om hur vi förstår prästadömet, hur vi förstår biskopsämbetet, hur vi förstår och lever ut våra ämbeten?<br/><br/>Det är därför jag är glad att jesuitprovinsen i Australien upprättar en uppförandekod, för vi pratar inte bara om sexuella övergrepp mot minderåriga. Vi talar om sexuella övergrepp mot vuxna, och vi talar om övergrepp på andra sätt - som missbruk av samvete, där du dikterar för någon vad du tycker, eller du låtsas veta av Gud, och du kan berätta för en annan person, "Du måste göra det", mot den personens samvete.<br/><br/>Många tror att celibat orsakar missbruk. Som jag alltid säger, celibat som sådant är inte orsak till missbruk - annars hur förklarar vi att 99,9 procent av alla missbrukare inte lever ett celibatliv, och hur förklarar vi att 95 eller 96 procent av alla präster inte missbrukar minderåriga? Men celibat, eller ett löfte om kyskhet, som inte är riktigt integrerat, som inte är riktigt levt ut ordentligt - ja, det ger ett problem. Ibland tar folk till att dricka, ibland tar de till spel, och ibland tar de till sexuella övergrepp, med vuxna och med minderåriga.<br/><br/>Den verkliga frågan om detta är hur vi hanterar begreppet religiös andlig kraft som präster och biskopar är investerade i? Hur kan teologi hjälpa oss att förstå, och kanske hur kan sociologi, psykologi eller företagsekonomi hjälpa oss att definiera maktens gränser och nödvändigheten av att hålla dina gränser? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Jag är inte förvånad över denna missmatchning, jag skulle till och med gå så långt som att säga att detta inte är något som någonsin kommer att förändras, och inte heller ska vi bli helt upphetsade över att ändra det. Om 10 år kommer vi fortfarande att ha blödande kant, komplexa saker i den största oroslistan, och de saker vi äntligen kommer att förstå kommer att vara de största delarna av våra utgifter.<br/><br/>Nu har Gunnar och Andy båda utmärkta poänger, särskilt om IT-team ser IT-problem och löser dem med IT-lösningar; Jag är faktiskt säker på att deras poänger är meriterande.<br/><br/>Men jag tror att det finns andra idéer som trumfar dem (jag kommenterade deras bloggar om det, och bestämde mig senare för att jag bara skulle blogga här). Dessa topp 3-problem är blödande nya, så att:<br/><br/>Vi fruktar nya saker för att vi inte förstår dem, eller inte förstår dem för att de är nya.<br/><br/>De är för nya för att vi ska kunna hantera dem.<br/><br/>De är för nya för att vi ska veta om vi borde vara oroliga eller inte! vi tenderar att vara paranoida / oroliga, vilket är bra!<br/><br/>för ny för att ha uppenbara budgetposter tilldelade till dem. Kan jag köpa en låda eller någon programvara som ger "molnsäkerhet" eller "social media security?"<br/><br/>de är så nya att verksamheten inte ens vet hur man använder dem eller vad de vill ha ut av dem. Än mindre hur vi kan säkra dem medan vi fortfarande möter eller åtminstone inte stampar över affärsbehov. Om företaget inte ens vet hur man använder dem ännu, är jag inte säker på att säkerheten är i någon position för att styra den användningen säkert.<br/><br/>Det bör också nämnas att dessa nya saker i stor utsträckning drivs via consumerland och in i verksamheten, med IT som ett slags "Oh yeah", tänkte. Brandväggar, AV, AM, Auth är alla IT-svar på typiska IT-problem. Naturligtvis finns det en skillnad där. De är också mycket subjektiva problem, i motsats till mycket objektiva objekt som brandväggar, kända skadliga bitar, beteenden, signaturer, portar. Företag presenterar mycket komplexa problem som ofta involverar människor (som vi inte kan lappa) och som ofta inte passar bra in i filtregler. Även om vi vände oss bort från tekniska lösningar och ägnade vår tid åt att lösa dessa problem, kommer de fortfarande inte att lösas snyggt. På samma sätt, när push kommer att skjuta, kan du ha och möta mål med brandväggar? Kan du visa förbättring? Allt detta strömmar från den ganska subjektiva icke-tekniska aspekten av dessa frågor. Typ av skillnaden mellan ett barns rapportkort och den feedback du får från en föräldrakonferens. Om du har ett barn, vilken skulle du vara mest benägen att inte hålla med eller inte nödvändigtvis tro? (Svaret är det subjektiva!)<br/><br/>Det kan sägas att detta är den naturliga utvecklingen av säkerhet och teknik: från att öka de tekniska kontrollerna för att flytta upp stacken mot beteende och människor. Visst, dessa 3 bästa oro kan sägas slå igenom brandväggar och nätverkssegment, men det är arten av dessa saker (sociala medier "punching" genom en brandvägg är mycket annorlunda än mig stansning genom en SSH-anslutning för att överbrygga mitt hemnätverk; sociala medier är besläktad med * sätt * Jag använder min SSH-anslutning efter att lasten redan är stansad eftersom det behövs; det vill säga sociala medier är hur port 80 används.)<br/><br/>I grund och botten pekar alla indikationer på att inte bli förvånad över denna dikotomi. Och jag tror inte att det här är någon ytterligare indikation på att IT / säkerhet gör det fel, eller inte är i linje med verksamheten, eller har en teknisk mörk server-rumsbakgrund. Jag säger inte att vi gör saker rätt eller vi är korrekt anpassade, men ovanstående är inte ett bra argument för att stödja teorin om dessa brister.<br/><br/>Nu för ett riktigt stort hopp. Jag skulle likna den nuvarande ökningen av mobila datorer för att vara lika stor som införandet av datorer i verksamheten och senare PC / Internet i affärer. Nu var jag inte med när det förra hände, inte heller var jag i branschen när persondatorrevolutionen svepte in i affärer, men jag skulle satsa på att det är den närmaste jämförelsen hittills. Jag kan till och med säga detsamma för sociala medier. Dessa är förbannat nya och de är stora förändringar utöver att bara ta in Macs eller ny programvara eller någon ny affärsprocess. |
