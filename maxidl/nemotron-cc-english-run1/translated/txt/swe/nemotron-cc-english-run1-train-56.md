| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Samtidigt som man erkänner att det är omöjligt att argumentera för att någon älskar något de hatar, och vice versa, är det fortfarande ofta roligt att försöka argumentet. När vi pratar med människor vars åsikter direkt motsäger våra, är vi tvungna att försvara vår smak, definiera våra åsikter och analysera varför vi reagerar som vi gör. Vilket är anledningen till att vi har Why Don't You Like This?, där två av våra medarbetare kommer att försöka ta reda på om människor med motsatta åsikter kan komma bortom "Nej, du har fel!" och ha en civil, konstruktiv och kanske till och med övertygande diskussion om deras stridspunkter. För oavsett vad radion säger så finns det fortfarande en medelväg mellan "Vi håller helt med" och "Jag har rätt, och du är dum och ond."<br/><br/>Scott: Sedan vi diskuterade min Scott Pilgrim Vs. Världens avfall, har vi letat efter ett fall där jag kan kalla dig för att inte gilla något underbart, och vi behövde inte leta länge. Vi satt precis bredvid varandra under Martin Scorseses Hugo-me, helt förtrollad av sin fantastiska hyllning till underverken i tidig stumfilm, och du, tydligen motstå den vid varje tur. Kritisk konsensus har varit på min sida: Det slog nr 9 plats på vår kollektiva Top 15 (även om du listade det som ditt överskattade val), har vunnit (eller placerat) i olika filmkritiska utmärkelser och har för närvarande en 83 poäng på Metacritic. Det betyder inte att du har fel, naturligtvis, men det åligger dig att förklara varför Hugo var, med dina ord, "ihålig och konstgjord", där många av oss såg det som en härlig uppmaning av Scorseses barndom och mediet när det fortfarande var i sin linda. Och var snälla när ni sliter sönder fjärilen med vingarna.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Tasha: Jag kan inte vara försiktig, Scott. Ibland gör det mindre ont om du sliter av Band-Aid på en gång. (Och även om det inte gör det, vem vill gå runt med en halv-rippad-off Band-Aid? Gross.) Faktum är att jag tyckte att Hugo var en tröttsam manipulativ övning i falskhet, med början från dess öppning glida genom en Paris tågstation, som påminde mig mer än något av Robert Zemeckis "The Polar Express. Till skillnad från Mike D'Angelo är jag ett fan av långa, obrutna tar som ett sätt att etablera ett utrymme och uppmuntra tittarna att omedvetet hålla andan när en kamera utforskar ett område; men när utrymmet som utforskas är en smidig, glänsande CGI-skapelse, och kameran flyter viktlöst genom den utan fysisk känsla att antingen kameran eller omgivningen verkligen är där, börjar den utforskningen kännas som att titta på någon annan spela ett videospel. Och resten av filmen kändes lika porlös och overklig för mig, både när det gäller dess inställning och när det gäller dess mycket konstruerade, maudlin historia.<br/><br/>Jag har inte nödvändigtvis problem med tillverkade, stiliserade miljöer i film. Jag älskade Baz Luhrmanns lika spretiga, helt konstgjorda syn på Paris i Moulin Rouge, till exempel, men den filmen har en känsla för sin egen löjlighet, en humor om hur avsiktligt överdrivet det är. Ditto stilisering av Jean-Pierre Jeunet, särskilt i Amélie. (Både Jeunet och Luhrmann kändes som starka visuella influenser här.) Jag fick dock känslan att Martin Scorsese ville att jag skulle ta Hugo helt på allvar. Även om det är ännu en värkande sentimental berättelse om ett modigt föräldralöst barn som tar färg tillbaka i livet på en sur gammal curmudgeon.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Det finns inget jag gillar mer på film än att bli överraskad. Och det finns inget jag ogillar och motstår mer än att bli öppet manipulerad, högt sagt vad jag ska känna och när jag ska känna det. En bra film gör den här typen av saker subtilt; en dålig använder kraschande musiksignaler och söta strängar - och i det här fallet en smutsig, storögd, disheveled föräldralös stirrar bedrövligt på kameran - för att kräva patos och för att berätta för tittarna att de är hemska människor om de inte serverar det på efterfrågan. Med det sagt kan jag hantera sorgliga barn och griniga vuxna som gör livet bättre för varandra - jag grävde verkligen årets Le Havre, som var i huvudsak samma tomt utan all cutesiness - men jag tycker att de konstgjorda miljöerna reflekterar dåligt på de konstgjorda känslorna, och var och en gör att den andra verkar mer falsk i tur och ordning.<br/><br/>Låt oss börja med det. I vår förbisedda filmvideo tog du och Noel båda Keith till uppgift för att kämpa för Tyrannosaur, för att du kände att det inte var realistiskt nog - för konstruerat, för miserablist, för mycket, för långt. Hur är det möjligt att du inte kan köpa en stymied gammal vev som bryter saker när han är arg, men du kan köpa en föräldralös som bor i en gigantisk tågstation klocka och inleda en nyckfull resa för att reparera en mystisk automat som han tror kan bära hemligheter från sin döda far, men som istället leder honom på en udda resa av självinsikt, in i det magiska landet film? Hittade du aldrig Hugos pråliga rokokodesign, aggressiv hjärtsträngplockning eller skottkärrlast av quirk även lite överdriven eller svår att svälja?<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet och Luhrmann som influenser på Scorsese?! Glöm att vara oanständiga, nu är du medvetet peta mig med en vass pinne. Om du letar efter inspiration för Hugo-ja, om du letar efter den känslomässiga kärnan i Hugo-du måste gå tillbaka till Scorseses barndom på Elizabeth Street i Little Italy, där en astmatisk liten pojke, oförmögen att leka ute med de andra barnen, drog sig tillbaka till Alexander Korda fantasier som The Thief Of Bagdad. Eller, helt enkelt, bara gå direkt till källan själv: George Mélies, vars resa till månen förblir Big Bang av alla filmiska fantasier, det ögonblicket när kameran inte användes för att dokumentera världen som den är, men oavsett nyckfull, magisk, transportplats som en filmskapare vill uppfinna för det. Och den traditionen har utvecklats och utvidgats i årtionden innan sådana som Jeunet och Luhrmann fick sina smutsiga små tassar på den.<br/><br/>Och på tal om Jeunet, trevligt försök att ta bort mitt retoriska vapen, men jag säger det ändå: Hur kan du älska Amélie, men ändå hitta Hugo syntetisk och "överdriven" och "trött manipulativ"? Du säger att Amélie och Moulin Rouge har försonande "känsla av [deras] egen löjlighet" där Scorsese menar att vi ska ta Hugo på allvar, och jag tror inte att så är fallet, åtminstone på den senare punkten. Att Scorsese känner en tydlig passion för filmerna är väl därför man tolkar Hugo som självseriös men för mig är det känslorna som ger filmen en känslomässig ballast som Luhrmann och Jeunet-filmerna inte har. Alla tre filmerna använder sig aggressivt av CGIs underverk - och Scorsese lägger till 3D till mixen, med underbar effekt - men där du och jag skiljer oss åt är i frågan om viktlöshet. Jag håller med om att CGI har en distanserande effekt; världar som helt består av digital plasticin är flexibla till den punkt där de ibland inte har någon närvaro. Du hänvisade till Hugo i din "överskattade" post för vår bästa film som "en CGI gimcrack" - en perfekt dis ... för en annan film.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Det är rättvist att säga att Scorsese har byggt Hugo runt en standardfråga, "hjärtsträngplockande" barnbok / filmplot: Orphan saknar sin pappa, skapar sin egen lilla fantasivärld, gloms på en ny vän, övertygar en crusty gammal fuddy-duddy att mjuka upp och kanske anta honom. Men det är bara det berättande skelettet, och Scorsese ger massor av kött och blod. För det första kan du inte titta på Hugo, den ensamma pojken, som kikar ut från klocktorn till en Paris tågstation utan att tänka på Scorsese, en annan ensam pojke, som stirrar ut genom sitt sovrumsfönster på Elizabeth Street. Och även om du inte är en tillräckligt stor filmnörd för att göra den kopplingen, känner jag verkligen att Hugos resa inte är att hitta en ny fadersfigur, utan att fortsätta med den mekaniska magin som står som hans egen fars arv. Det är vad film är: Den uthållighet av vision som tillåter oss att acceptera en illusorisk version av världen vid 24 bilder per sekund är vetenskap och magi på en gång. Hugos förhållande till Méliés handlar inte om att han myser med en ny pappa, utan att dela en gemensam entusiasm som den gamle mannen har nedsänkt i bitterhet. För mig är det en mycket mer unik vinkel på en potentiellt shopworn premiss.<br/><br/>Fanns det verkligen inget av Hugo som förtrollade? Även filmens få belackare verkar villiga att erkänna att sekvenserna som framkallade filmhistoria och Méliés studio - med Michael Stuhlbarg som den heroiska filmforskaren! - var fantastiskt. Det kändes, på bästa möjliga sätt, som en berusande komprimering av min History Of Film 101 klass på college, kondensera en termins värde av klipp och sammanhang till något mellan ett montage och en animerad popup-bok. Och det talar till den geniala designen av filmen, som lager fakta och fantasi så vackert att det är på en gång en historia av Méliés och födelsen av film, och bara den typ av enkla, överdådigt producerade filmiska undrar som Scorsese själv skulle ha älskat som barn. Tack och lov följer Hugo inte Jeunet/Luhrmann-modellen och har "en känsla av sin egen löjlighet". Som en fantasikännare själv, skulle du inte säga att det är värt att spela det rakt och allvarligt och oförskämt snarare än att blinka på publiken? Du kanske tycker att Hugo är sjukligt söt, men jag tror inte att äktheten av dess känsla är att förneka.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Tasha: Ja, jag hittade faktiskt delar av Hugo förtrollande. (Lägg märke till hur jag svarar på din fråga framför, medan du var för upptagen med att skumma med apoplexi för att ta itu med min, även om jag antar att det är ett svar i sig. Okej, "inflytande" kan överdriva fallet - jag menade bara att den visuella stilen såg väldigt bekant ut. Men som Keith påpekade när du tog upp detta personligen, Scorsese är varken emot att hämta inspiration från andra människors bilder, eller immun mot det.) Främst var jag förtrollad av de delar som handlar om Georges Mélies bakgrundshistoria, med sin kärlek till film, med det arbete han lade i sin konst och den glädje han fick ut av det. Det finns en hel del skönhet och roligt i iscensättningen av undervattensscenen från Mélies "Fairyland" och i sekvensen i slutet, med fokus på Mélies bilder. Jag medger att Hugos relation med Méliés över en delad kärlek till film är en fin touch. Och jag tycker om en bra film om filmskapande.<br/><br/>Men Hugo handlar inte i första hand om film, trots Mélis bindningar. Förutom de teman du citerar handlar det också om att hitta ditt syfte, som karaktärerna uttryckligen, mödosamt förklarar för varandra och för oss. Och det handlar om spektakel, och stora action setpieces, och jagar, och lyckligt någonsin efter slut där även den arga mobbaren och det blyga äldre paret och fergawdsakes även den gnälliga taxen alla blir parade med charmiga kärleksintressen i slutet. Den handlar om den superprecocious Hermione Granger-typen som är bossig och pigg och smart och prisar de magiska världarna inneslutna i böcker. Och all denna verksamhet är mäktig bekant och mäktig konstgjord.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese leker med arketyper, men jag har aldrig tyckt att han genomsyrade dem med något nytt, nytt eller trovärdigt, trots sin egen bakgrund. Jag hade mycket föredragit en berättelse om en ung Scorsese som växer upp med astma - något småskaligt och verkligt, utan stora rum fulla av CGI-urverk och gyllene glödande dammmoter och profetiska drömmar och en rasande vuxen tyrannvakt med ett hjärta av guld - allt det där outsized, over-the-top nonsens. Du citerar Scorseses personliga bakgrund och kärlek till film som bevis på att han verkligen känner vad han sätter på skärmen, men jag känner inte hans personliga touch i något av detta, förutom de stunder som uttryckligen handlar om film. Känslorna kan vara verkliga, men det gör inte avrättningen mindre falsk.<br/><br/>Du säger att känslans äkthet inte ska förnekas. Jag ifrågasätter inte om Scorsese personligen kände sig ensam och isolerad som barn, men jag känner inte ensamhet och isolering på skärmen - jag ser en massa överdrivna tecken (Hugo är smutsig och hans kläder är slitna och alla vuxna skriker på honom och han blir regelbundet jagad av en läskig hund!) och stora beats, med skrik och gråt och Spielbergian undra-emoting. För mig är uppriktighet mer övertygande och mer personlig när det är tyst och direkt; när någon skriker sina åsikter på mig, antar jag att han antingen är riktigt arg eller bara försöker överväldiga mina sinnen för att hålla mig från att uttrycka min egen åsikt. Hugo var ett enda långt rop, vad mig anbelangar.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Varför fick jag inte känslan av falskhet från Amélie? Jag erkänner helt att Amélie och Moulin Rouge är både stora, manipulativa, konstgjorda konstruktioner i exakt samma ådra, krävande specifika känslor med specifika intervall och försöker sälja dessa känslor med tung emoting och aggressiv soundtrack prodding. Ingen av dem sålde mig på sina känslor som äkta mänsklig känsla. Vad jag njöt av i dessa två filmer var konstruktionen - särskilt Amélies berusande, skrattretande listor över slumpmässiga karaktäriserande funktioner och erfarenheter för dess rollbesättning och Moulin Rouges musikaliska magpie mashups och recontextualizations. Jag säljs ofta på berättelser som gör kreativa eller ambitiösa saker med struktur, och båda dessa filmer kvalificerar sig, där Hugo är en mycket mer linjär, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>Men i slutändan, för mig, kommer det verkligen ner till en känsla av att dessa filmer är goofs, medan Hugo är tänkt att tas på allvar vid varje treacly ögonblick. Du tror inte att det är sant - men du försvarar samtidigt sin integritet när det gäller dess helt autentiska, rotade-i-Scorsese-historia känslor och säger att jag har fel, och han menar inte att det ska tas på allvar. Vad säger filmen om att det inte är menat att tas för vad det är? Och är det möjligt att detta bara är ett annat nyfiken fall av Benjamin Button-liknande situation där jag tycker att användningen av barn i stora budgetfilmer till stor del är sappy och melodramatisk, medan du som pappa tycker att det kringgår din cynism och går direkt till din familjekänsla?<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Scott: Inte säker på att jag menade att Scorsese inte menar att tas på allvar; det är bara att han har valt ett nyckfullt fordon genom vilket man kan uttrycka en seriös kärlek till filmerna. När du säger, "Men Hugo handlar inte i första hand om film, trots Mélis tie-ins," jag är mystified. Jag medger att du hittar många inslag av Hugo alltför bekant och mödosam och full av Spielbergian wonder-emoting - det finns inget jag kan göra för att argumentera kring den uppfattningen, som andra Hugo tvivlare delar. Ibland betyder en film att charma och förtrolla, och det gör det inte för vissa; du har Hugo och jag har Amélie, men jag tror att den senare, avsiktligt konstgjord som den är, betyder för oss att hitta det romantiskt. (Snarare än, säg, några hemska mekaniska anordningar som passar för en Saw uppföljare.)<br/><br/>Men att säga att Hugo inte främst handlar om film? Om det inte handlar om film, då är det den mest meningslösa diskursiva historien om [vad du än tror det handlar om] jag någonsin har sett. Relationen mellan Hugo och Méliés är filmens hjärta, och i hjärtat av det är inte bara en lageranslutning mellan Plucky Orphan och Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, men en gemensam affinitet för konstruerad magi - speciellt filmens magi. Jag tror att Scorsese och hans medarbetare har hittat ett sätt att uttrycka sin entusiasm under filmens tidiga dagar genom en fantasi som är tillgänglig för alla åldrar. Den arketypfyllda barnberättelsen är bara skorpan här; film är kakan. (Mmmm... paj.)<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>När det gäller The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button ser jag inte mycket av en anslutning, annat än att försöka avslöja mig som en Benjamin Button-försvarare som ett sätt att skada min trovärdighet. (Förresten, hur är extramaterialet på den G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Jag har sagt till dig att den sömnberövade nya pappan i mig kanske var sårbar för Benjamin Button, men jag kan inte föreställa mig en tid då förutsättningen för åldrande i omvänd skulle inte röra mig. Hur kan du inte påverkas av det?) Och dessutom ser jag inte hur Benjamin Button relaterar mycket till Hugo som en film om barn, eftersom det bara är ett litet segment av en historia som sträcker sig över en mycket större bana.<br/><br/>Så har jag övertygat dig? Sannolikt inte. Men jag är glad att höra att Hugo inte var helt utan förtrollningar för dig. Sekvenserna på Méli's filmaren är det som satte Hugo över för mig - och i det kan vi åtminstone dela lite filmkärlek.<br/><br/>Annonsering<br/><br/>Tasha: Nej, jag kan inte säga att du har övertygat mig, lika lite som jag har övertygat dig. Det är omöjligt att argumentera någon till en visceral kärlek till någonting, och det borde verkligen vara lika omöjligt att prata någon ner från visceral kärlek. För det mesta har du låtit mig se Hugo i Scott-O-Vision, vilket är en intressant upplevelse; åtminstone nu är jag milt övertygad om att vi inte på något sätt lyckades se helt olika filmer som båda på något sätt hade samma namn och regissör.<br/><br/>Vi hade säkert olika erfarenheter, men, och enligt min mening, fokuserade på olika aspekter av produktionen: Jag ser fortfarande inte "film är fantastiskt" tema som filmens enda sträng, så mycket som en bland för många. "Pointlessly diskursive" täcker nästan det, men jag skulle kasta in "ofta onödigt cutesy och dyrbar" ovanpå det. Medan du är fokuserad på filmens välsmakande pajfyllning, känner jag att pajen var täckt med ett pund kristalliserat socker, och jag tror att det gör skillnad, oavsett filmens kärnbudskap eller en handfull fantastiska scener. Se även Benjamin Button, som jag inte tog upp bara för att skava dig - jag tror verkligen att du har mer av en sentimental strimma än jag gör när det gäller barn på bio, särskilt när de används mer som symboler för sårbarhet och oskuld än som mänskliga karaktärer. Hej, vet du vilken film som helt inte har söta storögda moppar som ger hopp till en cynisk värld? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Kanske ska jag gå och titta på de där Blu-ray extramaterialen. Jag skulle kunna använda lite explosionsinsulin för att kompensera för Hugos sötma. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Jag hoppades att min dotter skulle vara fri från svåra och oroliga tider": Mee Mees historia som flyktingmamma<br/><br/>Hopp i tider av kris: En mors dag historia<br/><br/>Författare: Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee hörde att soldaterna skulle komma. Hon tog tag i sin son och anslöt sig frenetiskt till resten av byborna som sprang mot den thai-burmesiska gränsen, där FN: s flyktingkommissarie (UNHCR) var belägen. Hennes man var i en annan by som sprang i motsatt riktning, fick Mee senare veta. Efter att soldaternas jakt slutade återvände Mee hem till sin lilla by i Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>Under 1997-2000 levde Mee och tusentals som henne under det ständiga hotet om våld från burmesiska soldater. Många människor skulle ta en tillfällig tillflykt i djungeln, och återvända hem till sin by efter soldater lämnade området, bara för att göra det igen dagar senare. Ungefär en gång i veckan skulle Mee och andra vara på väg för att undvika tillfångatagande, våldtäkt eller död av soldater.<br/><br/>Under en incident sprang Mees man före sin fru för att säkra mat till sin familj. Hennes man sågs av soldater och sköts. Kulan krossade en del av hans bröstkorg och lämnade honom svårt sårad och i nöd när han reste mot djungeln med sin familj för säkerhet.<br/><br/>I tre månader gömde sig Mees man och flyttade familjen med ett irriterande sår vid sin sida. Han fick ingen medicinsk vård, förutom Mees skötsel.<br/><br/>"Jag var rädd för att återvända till Burma", sade Mee genom en tolk. "Jag var rädd för att dö. Jag grät och grät varje dag", fortsatte hon.<br/><br/>Mees man fick så småningom tillräckligt med styrka för att gå fem dagar mot en liten by i Thailand där de lärde sig platsen för ett sjukhus och ett flyktingläger. När Mee och hennes man slutligen kom till sjukhuset genomgick han omedelbar operation och tillfrisknade senare.<br/><br/>Symbol för hopp<br/><br/>Livet i djungeln för de flyende burmesiska soldaterna var verkligen skrämmande och svårt. provisoriska bambu tält med bara tak och golvbeläggningar blev lämpliga tillfälliga bostäder. Många kvinnor inklusive Mee födde barn i djungeln. Mees då sexårige son assisterade vid förlossningen av sin syster vid namn Eh Ku Hser. Hennes namn betyder kärlek – kall – söt. "Kall" i burmesisk kultur betyder för att inte passera genom livets eld, eftersom värme representerar oroliga tider.<br/><br/>»Jag hoppades, att min dotter skulle bli fri från svåra och oroliga tider», sade Mee. »Jag ville inte, att hon skulle gå igenom det, som jag hade erfarit», fortfor hon.<br/><br/>För Mee, hennes dotters födelse mitt i mörkret, plågan och rädslan, var en symbol för hoppet om ett nytt liv som skulle komma. Hopp i tider av kris, själva förutsättningen för United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) nyligen co-branded UMCOR-Välståndsljus, är också kärnan i det som ljus kastar ljus på.<br/><br/>En ny början<br/><br/>Med hjälp av UNHCR förverkligades hoppet om ett nytt liv för Mee och hennes familj när de flyttade till West Springfield, Massachusetts. Där träffade Mee Moo Kho Paw, en annan kvinna som emigrerade från Burma, och som arbetade på Prosperity Candle i Florens. Organisationen hjälper flyktingkvinnor som har flytt konfliktområden att återuppbygga sina liv genom konsten att göra ljus. Moo Kho rekommenderade att Mee skulle gå med i organisationen, och Mee tackade gärna ja.<br/><br/>"Jag var glad över att vara ute ur huset", sa Mee, "jag växte upp för att tro att eftersom jag var en kvinna, var min roll att stanna hemma och höja min familj", fortsatte hon. "Medan många burmesiska kvinnor vill göra mer för sig själva, uppmuntras de ofta att förbli hemmafruar."<br/><br/>Idag har Mee planer på att gå in i ljustillverkningsbranschen för sig själv och stödja sina fem barn, men hon uttryckte behovet av att lära sig engelska först.<br/><br/>"I det thailändska flyktinglägret hade vi utbildning, men det var inte så bra", sa Mee. "När jag var barn ville jag gå i skolan, men jag blev tillsagd att stanna hemma för att jag var kvinna. Nu har jag förhoppningar om att mina döttrar ska gå på college och bli läkare eller poliskvinnor.<br/><br/>Mee har hittat en jämn balans i sitt liv som hon önskar att andra skulle ha hittat - ett enkelt, lyckligt liv där arbete, omsorg om familjemedlemmar och valfrihet alla har sin plats.<br/><br/>Stöd flyktingkvinnor i USA<br/><br/>Dela denna mors dag berättelse med dina nära och kära.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Högskolor och universitet erbjuder ytterligare ekonomiskt stöd och ger resurser på campus för att hjälpa till att förbättra studentens högskoleutbildning. Anhängare noterar också det ökande antalet minoritetsansökningar till högskolor och universitet delvis på grund av positiv särbehandling.<br/>Statistik har visat att när bekräftande åtgärder elimineras, till exempel när det var på Berkley College och UCLA 1998, minskade minoritetsstudenternas antagning 61 procent respektive 36 procent, vilket visar att bekräftande åtgärder spelar en viktig roll i en minoritetsstudenters antagningsprocess. Bekräftande åtgärder anhängare tror också att mångfalden i högre utbildning ger en bättre pedagogisk atmosfär för alla studenter, personligen och intellektuellt. Om jakande åtgärder skulle elimineras skulle det finnas färre minoritetsstudenter inskrivna i högskolor, vilket gör att mångfalden är ganska smal. Bekräftande åtgärder är också nödvändiga för att kompensera för århundraden av ras, ekonomiskt och socialt förtryck. Personer med högre socioekonomisk status har fler möjligheter än de med lägre socioekonomisk bakgrund. Anhängare tror att vissa ras eller etniska grupper är missgynnade eftersom de ofta är i hushåll med lägre inkomst och följaktligen inte utsätts för samma resurser som studenter från högre socioekonomiska klasser. Förespråkare stöder begreppet konkurrens mellan studenter baserat på meriter, men hävdar att positiv särbehandling kompenserar för ekonomiska skillnader. Högskoleexamen, som har gynnats av bekräftande åtgärder, har också sagt att de fick bättre jobb, tjänade mer pengar och överlag lever bättre liv på grund av de lyckliga möjligheter de fick genom bekräftande åtgärder.<br/>Anhängare av positiv särbehandling betonar kontinuerligt den allvarliga betydelsen av positiv särbehandling, med tanke på dess bidrag till att förbättra både college erfarenhet och samhället i allmänhet. Motståndare till jakande åtgärder anser dock att det är dags att avsluta jakande åtgärder. Motståndare tror att jakande åtgärder skapades för att säkerställa rättvis antagningspraxis för att få förändring till en lång period av rasdiskriminering. De tror att politiken är föråldrad."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinationer<br/><br/>Kombinationer Är försvar mot en punch, koreograferade svar på olika typer av attacker. De har många namn över kampsporter men (i min erfarenhet) varje konst har en version av dem. Detta gör dem annorlunda än former eftersom det finns gott om kampsport som inte har några former. Vad gör det partner övningar så universella? Varför öva ett specifikt svar när (i verkligheten) timing, typ av attack, angriparens storlek och hundra andra faktorer kommer att göra det så att du aldrig använder hela det koreograferade svaret? Och slutligen, hur kan vi träna för en riktig försvarssituation och undvika skador samtidigt?<br/><br/>Kombinationernas universalitet är minst sagt imponerande. Vår stil av Kenpo karate har en lista med 108 kombinationer som kan läras. (De flesta elever lär sig bara 20-30 men) I brasiliansk Jiu-Jitsu spenderar du hela klasser som övar armstänger och chokes, lär dig varje subtilitet till flytten medan din partner erbjuder lite eller inget motstånd. Varje boxare har tillbringat timmar framför påsen och / eller spegeln kasta samma kombination av slag tills deras kropp rör sig genom reflex ensam. Kombinationer är universella eftersom vi inte har något bättre sätt att introducera rörelse och sedan öva de subtila positioner som krävs för att få dem att fungera. Att träffa en liten tryckpunkt genom kläder tar mycket övning, att fånga en armstång med kontroll kräver en noggrant placerad höft och en lömsk inställning, och en bra kombination är bara användbar om du kan genom den från en balanserad och skyddad position. Kan du tänka dig ett bättre sätt att få dessa färdigheter?<br/><br/>Det finns ett antal faktorer som avgör hur du svarar på en attack och om i en sparring match eller i en kamp, Jag har ALDRIG använt en hel kombination i mitt försvar. Varför då spenderar vi timmar att öva dem? Vi tränar dessa koreograferade svar eftersom målet inte är att dra ut kombination 8 varje gång du ser en krokslag utan att visa dig ett sätt att blockera det och sedan ett möjligt sätt att följa upp det. Jag har aldrig valt att använda kombination 3 i en verklighetssituation men blocket är en av mina go-to-rörelser. Kombinationer lägger till verktyg till verktygslådan de fixar inte bilen.<br/><br/>Den sista frågan är en fråga om säkerhet. Om vi övar för verklighetens skull måste vi replikera verkligheten. Hur förhindrar vi skador när vi gör det? När det kommer till det handlar det om att bygga förtroende. Vi börjar långsamt och lär oss att lita på att vi har kontroll över oss själva. Vi lär oss att lita på att våra partners har kontroll också. I mer tid lär vi oss att lita på vår kontroll över vår partner och (lite skrämmande) lär vi oss att lita på vår partners kontroll över oss. I slutet (med mycket övning) kan du flytta är full fart, kasta din partner och kastas utan rädsla för skada.<br/><br/>Kombinationer är universella av en anledning; de praktiseras så att de kan dissekeras i sina delar, och vi håller oss säkra genom att starta långsamt och bygga förtroende. Som med allt annat i kampsport, kombinationer har många skäl bakom sin praxis och utförande. |
