Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Inläggsnavigering<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" får pris för bästa manus<br/><br/>Bloggprojektet, "Life Without Papers", skapat av Len Grant, innehåller berättelser om papperslösa invandrarfamiljer och ungdomar. papperslösa invandrare har ingenting. De får inte arbeta. De har ingen rätt till statliga förmåner eller till en plats att bo. De är osynliga och potentiellt den mest utsatta gruppen i Storbritannien idag.<br/><br/>Odokumenterade (eller irreguljära) migranter inkluderar dem som smugglas in i sexhandeln eller för inhemskt slaveri; de inkluderar viseringsövernattare; de vars asylansökningar har avslagits och andra som har varit föremål för misslyckanden i invandringssystemet. Alla dessa kan ursprungligen ha kommit till Storbritannien lagligt.<br/><br/>"Olagliga invandrare" - de som föreställer sig att ha kommit in i landet i lastbilar - utgör en liten andel av de papperslösa.<br/><br/>Faktum är att vissa källor tyder på att hälften av de uppskattade 120 000 papperslösa barnen i Storbritannien faktiskt föddes här till papperslösa föräldrar. Dessa barn missgynnas från födseln, enbart av deras invandringsstatus.<br/><br/>Bloggen berättar historierna om de papperslösa. Den belyser deras dagliga kamp och sårbarheter, men också deras styrka och motståndskraft. Det är inte en lätt läsning.<br/><br/>Du kan komma åt bloggen via vår hemsida (nederst i högra kolumnen på hemsidan).<br/><br/>Bloggen har vunnit online-kategorin för Speaking Together media awards. Priserna var ett nytt tillskott i år till Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards-firandet på Royal Festival Hall i London som en del av Internationella kvinnodagen. Domarpanelen - inklusive romanförfattaren och dramatikern Gillian Slovo och journalisten och författaren Hannah Pool - letade särskilt efter arbete som utmanade myter och stereotyper.<br/><br/>Bloggen har också vunnit Blog North Awards 2013 i kategorin Best Writing och var också nominerad till ett Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath School lektion<br/><br/>I Galaterbrevet tar Paulus upp frågor som frihet, lagens roll i frälsningen, vårt tillstånd i Kristus och det Andeledda livets natur, liksom den urgamla frågan: Hur kan syndiga människor göras rättfärdiga inför en helig och rättvis Gud?<br/><br/>Många forskare tror att Galaterbrevet kan vara den tidigaste av Paulus brev. Det skrevs i AD 49, strax efter den berömda Jerusalem rådet (Apg 15). Därför kan boken vara den äldsta kristna dokument kända. Som Apostlagärningarna och Galaterbrevet klargör, befann sig den tidiga kyrkan i en hård strid om frälsningens natur, särskilt när det gällde hedningar. Enligt en grupp judiska troende, kända som Judaizers, var tron på Jesus ensam inte tillräckligt bra för icke-judar. Icke-judar måste också omskäras och följa Mose lagar (Apg 15: 1).<br/><br/>Detta kvartals bibelstudieguide inbjuder oss att resa med aposteln Paulus när han vädjar till galaterna att förbli trogna mot Jesus. Det ger oss också en chans att reflektera över vår egen förståelse av de sanningar som öppnade vägen för Martin Luthers slutliga brytning med Rom och återställandet av det bibliska evangeliet. |

Innan han efterträdde på tronen tjänstgjorde han som guvernör i Hannover från 1776 till 1786, den 11 december 1752 dog hans farbror Adolf Fredrik III och som ett resultat av detta efterträdde Karls äldre bror honom som Adolf Fredrik IV. Med sina bröders uppstigning togs Charles med resten av familjen från Mirow till huvudstaden Strelitz, från fyra års ålder såg Charles ut för en karriär i hannoversk tjänst efter att ha fått en kaptenskommission. Hans syster Charlotte gifte sig med kurfursten av Hannover, kung George III av Storbritannien den 8 september 1761, och hösten 1776 utnämndes Karl till generalguvernör av Hannover av sin svåger. Som guvernör i Hannover innehade Karl i praktiken alla befogenheter som en suverän härskare och hans svåger hade ingen önskan att bosätta sig i Tyskland, eftersom han var grundligt engelsk. Strax efter att ha blivit änka för en tid i december 1785, begärde Charles tillstånd att gå i pension från sina militära anställningar i Hannover. Hans svåger beviljade hans begäran, befordrade Charles till fältmarskalk, Charles tillbringade sedan en tid på resande fot innan han slog sig ner i Darmstadt, där han blev president för den kejserliga kreditkommissionen. Efter sin äldre bror Adolf Friedrich IV:s barnlösa död den 2 juni 1794 uppmuntrade Karl som härskare nya jordbrukstrender, upprättade en ny poliskår och genomförde obligatorisk utbildning.

Hon var äldsta barn och dotter till Karl II, storhertig av Mecklenburg, Charlotte och hennes systrar, drottning Louise av Preussen, drottning Frederica av Hannover och prinsessan Therese av Thurn und Taxis, ansågs vara sin tids vackraste kvinnor. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter tillägnade sin roman Titan till de fyra vackra, Charlotte växte upp i Hannover, där hennes far tjänstgjorde som guvernör, på uppdrag av sin svåger, kung George III av Storbritannien, som bodde i London. När Charlotte var tolv år dog hennes mor och hon uppfostrades av sin mors syster, Charlotte, som gifte sig med hennes far 1784 och hennes systrar fördes av hennes mormor, Maria Louise Albertine av Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg i Darmstadt. Charlotte hade då flyttat till Hildburghausen. Den 3 september 1785, vid femton års ålder, gifte sig Charlotte med hertig Fredrik, hertig av Sachsen-Altenburg, äktenskapet var inte lyckligt, Charlotte var mentalt överlägsen Fredrik, som började ignorera henne. De hade också problem, Saxe-Hildburghausen hade blivit ekonomiskt förstörd av Fredericks föregångares katastrofala politik. Mottagarna tillät hertigen och hertiginnan endast en reducerad Civil List, Charlottes far och två bröder bodde ofta hos Charlotte i Hildburghausen. 1787 flyttade hon till Hildburghausen permanent och blev ordförande i kreditkommittén. År 1792 flydde Charlottes mormor och hennes systrar för den framryckande franska armén från Darmstadt till Hildburghausen och hennes mormor lade märke till Charlottes make. Av alla sina plikter fullgör han sina äktenskapliga plikter med iver. Charlotte, som aldrig älskat den här mannen, är alltid gravid, familjen tillbringade flera sorglösa veckor på Hildburghausen. År 1793 återvände Charlottes mormor från exilen och reste med Charlottes systrar till Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte hade ett mycket intimt och kärleksfullt förhållande med sin syster Friederike och släktingar i Strelitz. Åren 1803 och 1805 besökte det preussiska kungaparet Hildburghausen, för detta tillfälle lät mottagarna hertigparet förnya en del av sina möbler. Louise hade hjälpt till att utarbeta krigsförklaringen, christian Truchse – von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg var vän med hertigparet och gudfar till Charlottes son Edvard. Många åskådare hade kommit för att se den bayerska kronprinsessan, när han tog emot sina gäster, försökte Truchseé leda den lägre rankade Charlotte först in i sitt slott, men hon vägrade, med hänvisning till sin dotter. Truchse – svarade: Ers höghet skall förlåta mig, men så länge detta slott har stått här, tog Therese sedan tag i baronernas andra arm, och de tre gingo genom porten tillsammans. hertiginnan gav ungefär hälften av sin inkomst åt de fattiga, pensionärerna<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Prins Charles av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prins Charles av Hessen-Kassel var kadett i ätten Hessen-Kassel och en dansk generalfältmarskalk. Han växte upp hos släktingar vid det danska hovet, tillbringade större delen av sitt liv i Danmark och hans mor var en dotter till kung Georg II av Storbritannien och Caroline av Ansbach samt en syster till drottning Louise av Danmark. Hans far, den blivande lantgreven, lämnade familjen 1747, 1755 avslutade han formellt äktenskapet med Maria. Farfadern, Vilhelm VIII, lantgreve av Hessen, beviljade grevskapet Hanau och dess intäkter till Maria, den unge prins Charles och hans två bröder, Vilhelm och Fredrik, uppfostrades av sin mor och fostrades av protestantiska släktingar sedan 1747. År 1756 flyttade Maria till Danmark för att ta hand om de minderåriga barnen till sin syster, drottning Louise av Danmark. Med henne tog hon sina söner som uppfostrades vid hovet på Christiansborgs slott i Köpenhamn. De hessiska furstarna blev senare kvar i Danmark och blev dess viktiga herrar, endast den äldste brodern Vilhelm återvände till Hessen 1785, när han besteg landgraviaten. År 1758 utnämndes han till överste, vid 20 års ålder till generalmajor, också 1766 utnämndes han till generalguvernör i Norge, en befattning han innehade till 1768 men som förblev mestadels titulär, då han aldrig reste till Norge under denna period. 1763 gifte sig hans äldre bror Vilhelm med sin kusin, Karl följde efter den 30 augusti 1766 på Christiansborgs slott – hans hustru var Louise av Danmark, och Karl blev därmed svåger till sin kusin, kung Christian VII. Äktenskapet ägde rum trots råd mot det, på grund av anklagelser om utsvävningar av prins Charles. Strax efter föll Charles i onåd vid hovet, och i början av 1767 skulle han och de få sitt första barn, Marie Sophie, där 1767 och därefter sitt andra barn, William, 1769. År 1768 köpte Charles egendomen och byn Offenbach-Rumpenheim från familjen Edelsheim. 1771 lät han bygga ut herrgården till slott och furstesäte och hans mor Maria bodde i palatset fram till hennes död 1772. År 1781 sålde Karl Rumpenheimpalatset till sin yngre bror, Karl bosatte sig på Gottorps slott i Schleswig med sin familj. De skulle få sitt tredje barn Fredrik där 1771, år 1770, kung Christian VII gav sin syster godset Tegelhof i Goeby mellan staden Schleswig och Eckernförde. Från 1772 till 1776 lät Charles uppföra ett sommarresidens på platsen som han döpte till Louisenlund till sin hustrus ära, i september 1772 utnämndes Charles till överbefälhavare för den norska armén och han och Louise flyttade till Christiana. Tilldelningen var en följd av Gustav III:s statskupp den 19 augusti 1772, medan prinsessan Louise i Norge födde sitt fjärde barn Juliane 1773.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Louise Caroline av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline föddes på Gottorp i Hertigdömet Schleswig till lantgreve Karl av Hessen-Kassel och hans hustru prinsessan Louise av Danmark.

Han anses vara grundaren av Casa dEste, efter att ha varit chef för den första familjen att vara herre över Este, Alberto Azzo II var den enda sonen till Albert Azzo I, markgreve av Milano. Han ärvde sina fäders ämbeten runt 1020, och ständigt ökade sina fastigheter i norra Italien, i 1069-1070, försökte han förvärva Maine för sin son Hugh, eftersom hans fru, Garsende, var en medarvinge till de tidigare grevarna av Maine. Hugh förklarades greve, men han kunde inte segra mot Robert, hertigen av Normandie, i Investiturstriden mellan Henrik IV, helige romerska kejsaren, och påven Gregorius VII, Azzo försökte medla, men senare anslöt han sig till påvens sida. Omkring 1073 gjorde han ett slott vid Este till sin bostad, varifrån huset Este, innan hans byggnadsprojekt, Este var föga mer än en by. Hans son Welf flyttade först till Kärnten och sedan till Bayern, vilket gav upphov till en av de viktigaste familjerna i Europas historia, en annan son, Fulk I av Milano, gjorde den första dokumenterade användningen av titeln markis dEste. Azzo II gifte sig med Kunigunde, dotter till Welf II, greve av Altdorf och de fick ett känt barn, Welf hertig av Bayern från 1070 till 1077 och från 1096 till sin död som var den första medlemmen av Welf-grenen av huset Este. Hans andra äktenskap var med Garsende, dotter till Herbert I, greve av Maine och de hade följande kända söner, Fulco I, markgreve av Milano, förfader till den italienska grenen av huset Este Hugh V, greve av Maine, hade inga problem. Vissa källor säger att han också gifte sig med Vitalia Orseolo, dotter till Peter Orseolo och han hade en utomäktenskaplig affär med Matilda, syster till Vilhelm, biskop av Padua, med vilken han hade en dotter vid namn Adelasia som gifte sig med Guglielmo Adelardi.

Han var den första medlemmen av Welf-grenen av huset Este, i släktforskningen av Welf-huset räknas han som Welf IV. Welf var son till Azzo II av Este och hans hustru Kunigunde av Altdorf, då Welfs morbror, Welf, hertig av Kärnten, dog barnlös, Welf ärvde sin egendom. Welf gifte sig med Ethelinde av Northeim, dotter till Otto II, hertig av Bayern, när hans svärfar, hertig Otto hade blivit fiende till kung Henrik IV och förverkat sitt hertigdöme, Welf förblev lojal mot kungen. I enlighet med Henriks befallningar tog han avstånd från och skilde sig från sin hertiginna, Ethelinde och denna händelse ägde rum vid Goslar år 1070, då delstaterna i Bayern i tysthet underkastade sig den nytillträdde hertigen, som var representant för en av de äldsta familjerna i provinsen. Hans avståndstagande från hertiginnorna, som kunde ha betraktats som en orättvis handling. påven och kejsaren försonades ytligt 1076, men året såg dem åter ägna sig åt aktiva fientligheter. Henrik förklarade, till följd av upprepade upprorshandlingar, Welf avsatt i sitt nyförvärvade hertigdöme. Med stöd av sina trogna bayerare, och med hjälp av sin far i Italien, kunde Welf dock behålla sin plats, dock dog Gregorius 1085 och hans efterträdare tog en mindre intensiv del i Tysklands angelägenheter. Welf, men fortfarande ansluta sig till partiet i kyrkan, efter skilsmässan, i 1070, från sin första hustru, gifte Welf Judith av Flandern, dotter till Baldwin IV, greve av Flandern, och änka Tostig Godwinson, earl av Northumbria. År 1089 gifte sig Welfs son Welf med Matilda av Toscana, vilket stärkte relationerna med påven, men efter att den yngre Welf skilde sig från Matilda 1095, gjorde Welf gott med kung Henrik IV och bekräftades på nytt i sin ställning som hertig av Bayern. Efter fadern Azzos död 1097 försökte Welf förvärva sin fars egendom söder om Alperna, 1099 anslöt sig Welf till det som skulle bli känt som korståget 1101, tillsammans med Vilhelm IX av Akvitanien, Hugh av Vermandois och Ida av Österrike. Hans främsta framgång var att förhindra en sammandrabbning mellan andra korsfarare, som hade plundrat bysantinskt territorium på väg till Konstantinopel, Welf själv undkom fiaskot, men dog på väg tillbaka i Paphos, Cypern, i 1101 och begravdes i Weingarten Abbey.

Som ung man förvaltade han släkterna Este egendom söder om Alperna, genom sitt giftermål med Wulfhilde, dotter till hertig Magnus av Sachsen, omkring 1095 förvärvade han en del av Billungsgodsen kring Loneburg. Han strävade efter att efterträda sin svärfar som sachsisk hertig när Magnus dog utan arvingar 1106. Hertig Henrik upprätthöll dock nära relationer med den härskande saliska dynastin, år 1116, gick han med i kejsar Henrik V:s andra italienska fälttåg för att bemäktiga sig godsen efter den framlidne Margravine Matilda av Toscana. Han efterträdde sin äldre bror Welf II som bayersk hertig, när den senare dog barnlös 1120, var Henrik också avgörande för att få till stånd 1122 års konkordat i Worms, vilket avslutade den långvariga Investiturstriden mellan påve och kejsare. Äktenskapet ingicks i maj 1127, och mellan Welf och Hohenstaufen-dynastierna varade fram till 1200-talet, men efter att Lothair hade vunnit valet införde han ett kejserligt förbud mot Fredrik II.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Följ oss på sociala medier<br/><br/>ÄR DU EN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Här är vad din kropp försöker berätta för dig<br/><br/>av<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Viktökning från out-of-control begär åt sidan, kan det vara frustrerande att ha en konstant längtan efter något ohälsosamt och inte vet varför. Den goda nyheten är att det vanligtvis finns en anledning bakom den brinnande önskan att hysa en påse potatischips, eller känslan av att du faktiskt kan dö om du inte får en pickle rightthisinstant (även om du inte är gravid). Om du till exempel har visioner om Vintergatans barer kan det innebära att du saknar ett mycket specifikt näringsämne i din kost. (Yup-det är mer komplicerat än att chokladbaren är så darn läcker.)<br/><br/>Vi pratade med Los Angeles-baserade dietist Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., för att få mager på några vanliga matbehov, liksom vad du kan göra för att mätta hungern utan att gå överbord. Fortsätt rulla för lite seriöst bra information!<br/><br/>Om du är sugen på choklad<br/><br/>Det betyder: Du kan sakna magnesium i din kost, säger Lenchewski. "Magnesium är ett viktigt mineral som är involverat i energiproduktion, glukosmetabolism och muskelfunktion. Detta gäller särskilt för dem som slår på gymmet hårt", förklarar hon. Dessutom sänker magnesiumnivåerna under de premenstruella veckorna av din period, vilket förklarar varför PMS så ofta kommer med chokladbehov.<br/><br/>Istället, nå för hög kvalitet, låg socker mörk choklad, som är naturligt hög i magnesium. "Jag rekommenderar att hålla sig till 75 procent kakao eller högre, och para den med en annan magnesium-rik källa som solrosfrön", säger Lenchewski. Hon föreslår chokladmärket Hu, ett litet livsmedelsföretag som fokuserar på högkvalitativa ingredienser som produceras lokalt. "Det är lite dyrt, men desto mer anledning att hålla delar i kontroll", säger hon. "Det är min personliga favorit." Vi är också stora fans av superfood-packade Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Om du är sugen på godis<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Att gräva rent socker är en bra indikation på att du har ont om energi", säger Lenchewski. "Tänk på det. Vad är det enda du kliar efter efter en fruktansvärd natts sömn eller runt 4 pm under en stressig arbetsdag? Svaret är vanligtvis socker eftersom det används som omedelbar bränsle för kroppens celler.<br/><br/>Istället nå för äpplen med nötsmör. "Om du raider dina medarbetares godisstash, rekommenderar jag en mer långsam kolhydrat med en källa till fett eller protein", säger Lenchewski. "Till skillnad från enkelt socker kommer detta att driva dina celler samtidigt som du undviker post-sockerkraschen. Två alternativ som gör för bra pick-me-ups nästa gång du längtar efter godis: ett skivat äpple med ditt val av nötsmör eller bär med 2% osötad grekisk yoghurt. Vi gillar att krossa en söt tand med dessa beroendeframkallande kokosnötchips också - de fyller, fri från tillsatt socker och bara så bra.<br/><br/>Om du är sugen på salt<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Om ingenting annat än den saltaste pickle kommer att göra, kanske du inte dricker tillräckligt med H2O", säger Lenchewski. "Salt hjälper kroppen att hålla fast vid vatten, så vi längtar efter det när vi behöver vätskor."<br/><br/>Istället sträcker du dig efter vatten. "Håll dig hydrerad, särskilt när vi närmar oss sommarmånaderna", säger hon. Nästa gång ett begär träffar, försök att släcka det (bokstavligen) med några uppfriskande glasögon och du kan hitta brådskan att natriumbinge försvinner. "Om vanligt vatten tråkar ut dig, försök att lägga till i mynta, citron eller frusen frukt för att blanda upp det", säger Lenchewski. Och om det fortfarande inte gör tricket, finns det ett hälsosammare alternativ till påsade chips eller pommes frites. "Om du verkligen bara begär salt trots allt, är rostade tång ett bra kalorialternativ", säger hon.<br/><br/>Om du vill ha stärkelserika kolhydrater som pasta<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Eftersom högkolhydratmat ökar det må bra hormonet serotonin, kan stärkelsebehov vara ett tecken på att du behöver en humörbooster", säger Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Istället nå för ett bad! "Bust ut Epsom salter, eftersom det är dags för några allvarliga R + R", säger Lenchewski. "Lita på mig. Att hänge sig åt en stärkelse fri-för-alla känns riktigt bra i ögonblicket, men det kommer sannolikt att bum du ut mer nästa dag." (Som alla som någonsin har över-indulged en pizza eller pasta begär vet.) Så nästa gång du vill dyka huvudet först i en skål med kolhydrater, dra ett bad, tända ett ljus och unna dig utan ånger eller täta kalorier.<br/><br/>Om du är sugen på glass<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Det betyder: "Din kropp kan berätta för dig att den behöver lite hälsosamt fett."<br/><br/>"Jag är en realist, så om du vill ha glass, kommer jag inte att rekommendera en handfull valnötter, som naturligtvis är fulla av hälsosamt fett", säger Lenchewski. "För glass nödsituationer, rekommenderar jag lägre-i-socker kokosnöt glass som Coconut Bliss eller Kippy tre-ingrediens glass i Los Angeles." Vi kan gå i god för det faktum att kokosnöt glass smakar otroligt och precis som the real thing.<br/><br/>Om du är sugen på en hamburgare<br/><br/>Det betyder: Du behöver järn. "Om du inte kan sluta tänka på rött kött, finns det en chans att din kropp längtar efter järn, b12 och folsyra", säger Lenchewski. "Detta är särskilt sant under eller runt den tiden i månaden."<br/><br/>Istället nå för en hälsosammare hamburgare. "Jag är en förespråkare för gräsmatat, antibiotika och hormonfritt rött kött en gång i veckan", säger Lenchewski. "Försök experimentera med en öppen bisonburgare - som, skuren för skärning, är smalare och har mer järn än nötkött." Försök att införliva någon form av växtbaserat järntillskott i din rutin, som spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Hon hör klockan ding N-1 gånger, så hon vet att Bob blev tillsagd N + 1. Därför kan hon på nästa ding korrekt gissa Bobs hemliga nummer. Om vi har att göra med små nummer kan det dock spelas annorlunda. Om Alice fick veta 1, vet hon att Bob fick veta 2 eftersom 0 inte är ett positivt (eller negativt) nummer.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Webbtjänster, leverantörer och cyberlagar!<br/><br/>Uppdaterad den:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Datorisering av denna värld förändrade människans prestandascenario i stor utsträckning och det också bortom mätning. Till exempel kan du nu skicka viktig information över hela världen med ett enda musklick tack vare internetanslutning. Tyvärr är det denna breda anslutning och popularitet bland människor, internet har också ökat chanserna för datorbrott. Internetbrott eller datorbrott är allmänt kända som "Cyberbrott".<br/><br/>"Cyberlagar" är något nytt i rättsväsendet men har fått mycket uppmärksamhet på senare tid. Termen cyberbrott är något mycket synonymt med konventionell brottslighet, den enda skillnaden är medel för utförande. Det finns i huvudsak två typer av cyberbrott, den första är där datorer är de viktigaste målen och dessa inkluderar fall av dataskador, skadlig kod och till och med kriminell dataåtkomst. Den andra är i vilken dator är bara ett verktyg med vilken konventionella brott begås för t.ex. cyber terrorism, spam, cyber stalking och många fler.<br/><br/>Det är här en webbplats konsult eller en leverantör kommer in i scenen. Även om inte medveten om alla cyber lagar närvarande till datum, en webbplats leverantör kan ge dig råd om några av de viktigaste cyber lagar samtidigt som du skapar din webbplats.<br/><br/>Detta kan inkludera allmän kännedom om kopieringsrättigheter eller till och med skydda innehållet på din egen webbplats. Att förklara dig alla rättigheter du har som webbplatsägare är också en uppgift som en webbplatsleverantör kan göra när du utvecklar din webbplats. En leverantör kan också hjälpa dig genom att erbjuda dig information om olika cyberlagar för att skydda data. Förutom allt detta kan en leverantör också erbjuda dig information om någon ny cyberlag som du kanske inte känner till till vet. Cyberlagar kan variera från land till land, ett färskt exempel kan vara cookielagen som släpptes i Storbritannien, vilket hindrar webbplatsen från att spara användarwebbdata. I enlighet med cookielagen kan webbplatser i Storbritannien inte spara cookiefiler utan informationssamtycke från surfaren.<br/><br/>Det är efter genomförandet av sådan lag, webbplatser har nu ett popup-fönster, som söker samtycke från besökaren för att spara cookies filer. Sådana filer används av webbplatser för att analysera besökarnas surfmönster baserat på vilka annonser som sedan publiceras i ett användarfönster. Med hacking inte längre en ny sak för oss alla, tror du att sådana regler och förordningar kan förhindra online förfalskning eller cyberbrott? Tekniken har utvecklats i snabb takt, men fortfarande föredrar människor inte att handla online på grund av rädsla för att personliga eller bankkontouppgifter blir hackade. Med ökningen av cyberbrottslighet har behovet av stränga cyberlagar också ökat för att stävja detsamma och för att främja en riskfri shoppingupplevelse.<br/><br/>Klasser av cyberbrott<br/><br/>Under årens lopp har det förekommit tre stora klasser av cyberbrott:<br/><br/>Obehörig åtkomst till datorsystemfall, vilket innebär att hacka eller stjäla användarnamn och lösenord för att få tillgång till personlig information om respektive användare. Denna typ av bakdörrsåtkomst organiseras med hjälp av Trojan Horse. Frigör skadliga program som Trojan House, maskar eller datorvirus etc. Den sista klassen inkluderar cyber stalking en användare eller online trakasserier.<br/><br/>Direkta konsekvenser av cyberbrott<br/><br/>Minskad försäljning<br/><br/>Minskad personalutgång på grund av nätverksförseningar<br/><br/>Förlust av personlig information som forskningsarbete<br/><br/>Störningar i kommunikationsprocessen<br/><br/>Indirekta konsekvenser av cyberbrott<br/><br/>Trovärdighet i vårt finansiella system<br/><br/>Varumärkesbilden är fläckad på marknaden<br/><br/>Cyberbrott påverkar affärsrelationen på marknaden<br/><br/>Känsla av förtroende för statliga politik och myndigheter är förlorad<br/><br/>Förhindra cyberbrottslighet<br/><br/>Som nätanvändare finns det vissa försiktighetsåtgärder som vi bör överväga för en säker och säker online-upplevelse. Här är några av dem:<br/><br/>Det första du ska göra är att hålla personlig information för dig själv och undvika att dela samma online.<br/><br/>Undvik att dela bilder med vänner eller främlingar online.<br/><br/>Installera senaste versionen av anti-virus på ditt system kan erbjuda dig en bra försvarslinje mot internet hot som virus och skadlig kod.<br/><br/>Att hålla tillbaka upp dina värdefulla data är ett bra alternativ för att undvika problem som virusförorening.<br/><br/>Undvik att skicka kreditkortsinformation till webbplatser som inte är säkrade och inte har något giltigt certifikat.<br/><br/>Installera säkerhetsprogram som ger dig kontroll över webbplatsens cookies och sparar dig från att spåras av webbplatser.<br/><br/>Att sätta värdbaserade intrångsdetekteringsenheter på servrar hjälper dig att hålla reda på oegentligheter på din webbplatstrafik.<br/><br/>Användning av brandvägg rekommenderas.<br/><br/>Varför är cyberattacker så populära?<br/><br/>Billigare än traditionella fuskmetoder<br/><br/>Att spåra cyberbrott är inte lätt<br/><br/>Exakta platser kan inte spåras enkelt<br/><br/>Frånvaro av fysiska barriärer i internetvärlden<br/><br/>Cyberbrott drabbar många<br/><br/>Slutsats<br/><br/>Det faktum att det mänskliga sinnet har outgrundlig makt är obestridligt, vilket är anledningen till att internetbrott ökar i en enorm takt. Även historien har bevittnat några av de största internetsäkerhet gått kaput av händerna på hackare, som har lätt kommit undan också. Det enda sättet att begränsa sådan brottslighet är att vara medveten om de cyberlagar som vi har idag, som antingen kan vara via internet eller via webbplats / IT-leverantörer. Informationsteknologilagen måste balanseras på ett sådant sätt att den visar sig vara för sträng för personer som är inblandade i cyberbrott och samtidigt får den aldrig hämma internetindustrins tillväxt.<br/><br/>Författare Bio: - Maneet Puri leder för närvarande ett högkvalitativt webbdesignföretag beläget i New Delhi, Indien.
