In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online HLR-certifieringsblogg<br/><br/>Datum: 23 juli 2014<br/><br/>Autosomal dominant interstitiell njursjukdom är en sällsynt samling av sjukdomar som påverkar de kända funktionerna i njuren. Enkelt uttryckt kännetecknas tillståndet av: man utvecklar en njursjukdom och genomgår en njurtransplantation och andra sjukdomar som är förknippade med sur koncentration i blodet och gikt. I teorin kommer tillståndet att uppstå även om den genetiska förändringen ärvs från en förälder och uppstår sporadiskt när det inte finns någon familjehistoria.<br/><br/>Vanliga namn på autosomal dominant interstitiell njursjukdom<br/><br/>Tillståndet har även andra namn nämligen: medullär cystisk njursjukdom, även om detta namn inte används lika mycket eftersom de flesta som lider av detta tillstånd inte har medullära cystor. Det kallas också juvenil hyperuricemic nefropati. Sjukdomen tenderar att påverka människor i åldrarna 20 till 50. Det senare tillståndet som tidigare nämnts förekommer hos små barn, något som översätter för att få det från båda föräldrarna.<br/>Cystisk njursjukdom är ett ärftligt tillstånd där cystorna i mitten av varje njure gradvis förlorar sin förmåga att fungera ordentligt. Cystor hänvisar till onormala blåsor av vätska i njuren. Tillståndet skrämmer ytterligare njuren som inte kan koncentrera urinen och som ett resultat producerar för mycket urin. Dess symtom inkluderar överdriven urinering, saltbehov, svaghet, förvirring, blödning, trötthet, frekvent hicka, lågt blodtryck, illamående och kräkningar, huvudvärk, blek hud, minskad känsla i händerna, viktminskning bland många andra. Andra komplikationer inkluderar: anemi, sår, förlust av bentäthet, infertilitet och andra hjärtrelaterade problem.<br/>Dess analys innehåller blodprov för att kontrollera natriumnivåer och allmänna njurfunktioner, urinprov för att kontrollera koncentrationsnivåerna och andra obalanser, röntgenstrålar för att kontrollera storleken på njurar som kan ändras på grund av ökade urinkoncentrationer, njurbiopsi och genetisk testning för att verifiera eventuella genetiska förändringar som kan ha skett i rätt tid.<br/>Medan sjukdomen inte har ett snitt och torr behandling till det, kan man fokusera på att kontrollera åtgärder, som inkluderar intag av vätskor och salt för att komplettera den förlorade som sjukdomen fortskrider i senare skeden. Detta bidrar också till att minska uttorkning. Andra behandlingar inkluderar att ta receptbelagda läkemedel och kostförändringar och minimala intag av livsmedel som innehåller fosfor och kalium. Ytterligare komplikationer kan också kräva att man har en njurtransplantation.

Liknande funktioner för båda är ADH-resistent urinkoncentration som leder till polyuri och polydipsi, anemi och njursjukdomar.<br/>Det tidigare nämnda tillståndet är Autosomal recessiv redovisning till 15% av kroniska sjukdomar och orsakar ESRD under tidig barndom medan den senare är Autosomal dominant med några sporadiska nya mutationer och orsakar ESRD för personer mellan 30 och 50 år. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Lockes berättelse om naturens tillstånd<br/><br/>Ämne: FilosofiOrd: 2539Antal sidor: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes och Locke är bland de mest inflytelserika politiska filosofer som någonsin skrivit på engelska. Naturtillståndet, som föregår organiseringen av de komplexa samhällena, är den gemensamma premissen som både Hobbes och Locke delar men tolkar på olika sätt. De förstnämnda betraktar människorna i sitt naturliga tillstånd som lika farliga och fria att fullfölja sina egoistiska mål utan att begränsas av de obefintliga föreställningarna om rättvisa, varför hans naturliga tillstånd utgör "varje människas krig mot varje människa" (Hobbes76). Den senare däremot betraktar människan i sitt ursprungliga tillstånd som lika värdefull och inskränker den naturliga friheten genom idén om rättvisa som kräver att inte skada andra, vilket gör det möjligt att definiera naturtillståndet som "ömsesidigt bistånd och bevarande" snarare än krig (Locke 15). Huvudskillnaden mellan de två filosofernas redogörelser för naturtillstånd är att Locke använder etiska överväganden medan Hobbes inte gör det, och det leder i slutändan Hobbes att tänka sig en stat som utövar obegränsad makt över människor, medan Locke begränsar regeringen genom de moraliska principerna, som han anser vara en naturlag.<br/><br/>Hobbes grundar sina antaganden om naturtillståndet på det faktum att alla människor är ungefär lika i sin fysiska och mentala förmåga. Han medger att vissa individer kan visa större fysisk styrka eller överlägset intellekt, men insisterar på att "när allt räknas tillsammans, är skillnaden mellan människa och människa inte så stor" (Hobbes 74). Eftersom människor är ungefär lika i sin förmåga, har de också liknande förhoppningar om att uppnå sina mål och tillfredsställa sina behov (Hobbes 75). Som ett logiskt resultat av denna jämlikhet, när folket börjar konkurrera om knappa resurser, kan ingen känna sig helt säker i sina ägodelar. Även om en mäktig, listig och kapabel person lyckas underkuva "alla människors personer han kan", garanterar det fortfarande inte den ultimata säkerheten (Hobbes 75). Eftersom ingen människa kan få en sådan överlägsenhet över de andra som gör honom eller henne helt immun mot sin styrka av intellekt, kan ingen människa känna sig helt säker när omgiven av hans eller hennes jämlikar. Hobbes jämlikhet i det naturliga tillståndet är jämlikhet av rädsla, där alla människor ser varandra som farliga konkurrenter.<br/><br/>Precis som Hobbes anser Locke att alla människor är fundamentalt lika, men tilldelar termen en helt annan betydelse. Från hans perspektiv är det inte jämlikhet i förmågor, utan snarare jämlikhet i värde. Han menar att människorna "promiskuöst födda till alla samma fördelar i naturen" logiskt bör njuta av den perfekta jämlikheten mellan dem, eftersom det inte finns någon anledning att betrakta någon som är i sig mer värdefull (Locke 8). Den enda möjliga grunden för att utse vissa människor som överlägsna andra skulle vara om Gud "genom någon uppenbar förklaring av hans vilja, sätta en över en annan" (Locke 8). Eftersom en sådan gudomlig sanktion av överlägsenhet saknas, drar Locke slutsatsen att den naturliga jämlikheten för alla representanter för mänskligheten inte kan ifrågasättas. Hobbes närmar sig jämlikhet pragmatiskt och betonar att människor i sitt naturliga tillstånd är lika farliga, men Locke använder ett etiskt förhållningssätt och betonar att människor är lika värdefulla i Guds ögon. Denna oenighet är bara den första skillnaden mellan de två författarna baserat på det faktum att Locke inkluderar Gud som en förutsättning i sin politiska filosofi, medan Hobbes inte gör det.<br/><br/>Ett annat karakteristiskt drag i Hobbes redogörelse för det naturliga tillståndet är hans tolkning av friheten. Enligt Hobbes innebär naturtillståndet obegränsad frihet att göra vad som är nödvändigt för ens fortsatta existens. Filosofen definierar frihet som "frånvaron av yttre hinder" i att använda sina förmågor för att uppnå sina mål (Hobbes 79). Det primära syftet med varje kännande varelse är att upprätthålla sin fortsatta existens. Som en följd härav uppgår den hobbesiska friheten till det obehindrade tillfället att göra vadhelst som enligt ens omdöme vore bäst lämpat för att bevara ens liv och ägodelar (Hobbes 79). Den enda begränsningen till frihet är att en person inte kan göra något som strider mot att upprätthålla hans eller hennes liv eller förstöra "medlen för att bevara samma" (Hobbes 79). Bortsett från det finns det inga gränser, och alla har "rätt till allt, även till varandras kropp" om det främjar ens överlevnad (Hobbes 80). Således är den naturliga friheten, som Hobbes ser den, frånvaron av yttre påtvingade hinder för att fullfölja sin rätt till allt för att upprätthålla och säkra sin fortsatta existens.<br/><br/>Locke upprätthåller också idén om naturlig frihet, men inte överraskande närmar sig det på ett sätt som skiljer sig väsentligt från Hobbes. Så snart han börjar diskutera frihet i naturtillståndet, noterar han omedelbart att ett tillstånd av frihet inte likställer "ett tillstånd av licens" (Locke 9). Filosofen identifierar två specifika begränsningar för mänsklig frihet i naturtillståndet. Den första är identisk med den som introduceras av Hobbes: men fri och oberoende, en person ändå "har inte frihet att förstöra sig själv" (Locke 9). Enligt Locke har varje människa en naturlig skyldighet att inte ”skada någon annan i sitt liv, sin hälsa, sin frihet eller sina ägodelar” (9). Precis som med sin tolkning av jämlikhet, grundar författaren detta påstående på etiska och religiösa grunder: människor bör bevara varandras existens eftersom de är alla skapelser av samma "omnipotent, och oändligt kloka maker" (Locke 9). Således begränsar Lockes frihet i det naturliga tillståndet långt strängare än Hobbes genom att införa skyldigheten att avstå från att skada både sig själv och de andra.<br/><br/>Skillnaderna mellan de två författarna visar sig också i deras redogörelser för rättvisa i mänsklighetens naturliga tillstånd. När det gäller Hobbes är det bara frågan om lagen att avgränsa rättvisa och orättvisa metoder. Det finns ingen rättspraxis i naturtillståndet, och den enda lag som styr människor i deras ursprungliga tillstånd är en naturlag som bara tvingar dem att söka personlig säkerhet. Som ett resultat kan ingenting vara orättvist i mänsklighetens ursprungliga tillstånd: "notioner om rätt och fel rättvisa och orättvisa" har ingen plats och ingen mening i avsaknad av den strängt verkställda lagen (Hobbes 78). Så länge folket använder sin nästan obegränsade frihet att hänsynslöst konkurrera med varandra om resurser, som de har lika rätt till, har de inga kriterier för att skilja mellan rättvisa och orättvisa handlingar. Därför, Hobbesian naturtillstånd trotsar själva idén om rättvisa eftersom författaren tolkar det som en ren funktion av den formaliserade och etablerade lagen.<br/><br/>Locke tilldelar rättvisan en annan innebörd och betraktar den inte så mycket i lagstiftande som i etiska termer. Detta papper nämnde redan att Locke, till skillnad från Hobbes, använder etiska föreställningar och baserar i allmänhet sin politiska filosofi på moraliska snarare än rent praktiska antaganden. Lockes naturlag, till skillnad från Hobbes, tvingar människor att ta hand om varandra snarare än att bara lämna alla att klara sig själva. Som ett resultat finns det en plats för rättvisa och orättvisa i hans naturtillstånd. Författaren pekar på detta faktum själv när man noterar att ingen bör beröva en annan av hans eller hennes liv av medel för att bevara det "såvida det inte är att göra rättvisa på en gärningsman" (Locke 9). Detta uttalande avslöjar med största tydlighet att det enligt Locke finns rättvisa i naturtillståndet, och dessutom måste människor aktivt bevara det. Kriteriet för rättvisa, som Hobbes naturliga tillstånd saknar, är den andra begränsningen av naturlig frihet som Locke ålägger: en handling är orättvis om den utgör ett obefogat hot mot en annan persons liv och ägodelar.<br/><br/>Dessa skillnader i de två författarnas behandling av jämlikhet, frihet och rättvisa eller orättvisa kulminerar i deras tolkning av förhållandet mellan naturtillståndet och krigstillståndet. Från Hobbes perspektiv är de två synonyma, eftersom den hänsynslösa konkurrensen är det enda logiska resultatet av att sätta människor med likvärdiga förmågor och liknande behov i en miljö med begränsade resurser. Han förklarar denna förbindelse direkt: "om två män önskar samma sak, som de likväl inte båda kan njuta av, blir de fiender" och befinner sig därför i krigstillstånd med varandra (Hobbes 75). Men eftersom människor är många och alla har liknande förmågor och behov, manifesterar denna konkurrens inte bara i de enskilda interaktionerna utan också på mänsklighetens nivå som helhet. Så länge alla människor har lika och obegränsade rättigheter till alla resurser och till och med till varandras kroppar och liv, är naturtillståndet ett krig av "varje människa mot varje människa" (Hobbes 76). Denna bistra tolkning härrör direkt från Hobbes skildring av naturtillståndet som styrs enbart av individernas egoistiska drifter.<br/><br/>Locke däremot skiljer mellan naturtillståndet och krigstillståndet och påpekar att även om de kan förekomma samtidigt, är det ingen anledning att identifiera sig med varandra. Lockes definition av krigstillståndet är praktiskt taget identisk med den som Hobbes erbjuder. "Den som försöker få en annan man i sin absoluta makt sätter sig därmed i krigstillstånd med honom" (14). Denna förklaring stämmer perfekt överens med den hobbesianska uppfattningen att allas universella rätt till allt, inklusive andra människors kroppar och liv, leder till krigstillstånd. Ändå vägrar Locke att likställa krigstillståndet och naturtillståndet just därför att han förnekar Hobbes tolkning av den naturliga friheten. Eftersom Lockes naturliga tillstånd hindrar människor från att skada varandra genom frihetens andra begränsning, är ett försök på en annan persons frihet en överträdelse av naturlagen. Medan för Hobbes är krig mänsklighetens villkor som standard, framställer Locke det som en perversion av naturtillståndet snarare än dess regel.<br/><br/>Dessa skillnader i att avgränsa staten på naturen och dess beståndsdelar, såsom frihet, jämlikhet, rättvisa och krig, bana väg för författarna kontrasterande skildringar av regeringen. Baserat på hans pessimistiska bedömning av tillståndet i naturen, författaren av Leviathan drar slutsatsen att under förhållanden av krig, kan det inte finnas något definitivt hopp om att "leva ut den tid som naturen normalt tillåter män att leva" (Hobbes 80). Lösningen är att fastställa den universella rätten till allt och lämna alla "så mycket frihet mot andra män, som han skulle tillåta andra män mot sig själv" (Hobbes 80). Deltagarna i det resulterande sociala kontraktet investerar de obegränsade friheter de har överlämnat till en suverän - bärare av den högsta makten vars syfte är att bevara den uppnådda status quo genom att straffa alla överträdelser mot den. Suveränens makt är absolut: härskaren har befogenhet "att göra vad han anser nödvändigt" för att främja fred mellan sina undersåtar så att ingen skulle angripa en annans liv eller egendom (113). Hobbes drar slutsatsen att utan en sådan oantastlig figur med rätt att göra någonting för undersåtarna, kan det inte finnas någon fred och ingen garanti för säkerhet.<br/><br/>Medan Locke håller med om nödvändigheten av att skapa politiskt organiserade samhällen, motsätter han sig ändå Hobbes idé om den suveräna makten som obegränsad och oantastlig. Som nämnts ovan är Lockes naturtillstånd inte alls lika hemskt som det som målades av Hobbes på grund av folkets skyldighet att bevara inte bara sig själva utan också varandra. Därför uppstår behovet av socialt kontrakt inte av rädsla för de andra, utan från den rena bekvämligheten. Små samhällen kanske inte behöver många lagar för att lösa konflikter och "officerare att övervaka processen", men större föreningar tycker att det är lämpligt att inrätta regeringar för det ändamålet (Locke 57). Regeringens makt kan likväl icke vara obegränsad, emedan den skulle medföra, att undersåtarna underkastades en »okonstant, osäker, okänd, godtycklig vilja hos en annan människa» (Locke 17). en sådan regering skulle utgöra ett dubbelt brott mot naturlagen. Genom att gå med på en annan persons absoluta makt över sitt liv skulle ett ämne bryta mot sin första begränsning som förbjuder att skada sig själv. När det gäller härskaren skulle förstöra en annan persons frihet utgöra direkt skada och som sådan vara i strid med den andra begränsningen.<br/><br/>Som en direkt fortsättning på sitt fall för obegränsad regeringsmyndighet förnekar Hobbes maktdelningen som princip. Ur hans perspektiv, den suveräna, en gång inrättats, äger "hela makten att förskriva reglerna" som styr livet för de undersåtar eller, i kortare termer, den lagstiftande makten (Hobbes 114). Den suveräna förbehåller sig också rätten att "höra och avgöra alla kontroverser" - det vill säga den rättsliga makten (Hobbes 114). Slutligen, eftersom suveränens hela syfte är att tvinga undersåtarna att avstå från att skada varandra, kan det inte råda något tvivel om att den verkställande makten också är hans eller hennes exklusiva privilegium. Uppdelningen av befogenheter som begrepp är främmande för Hobbes på grund av hans syn på naturtillståndet. Att skapa en politisk enhet där de verkställande, lagstiftande och rättsliga grenarna skulle kontrollera varandra - det vill säga konkurrera - skulle innebära att återskapa det hobbesiska naturtillståndet på en högre nivå. Eftersom folket ingår ett samhällskontrakt och inrättar en regering för att lägga naturtillståndet bakom sig, inte återinföra det i en annan form, motsäger maktdelningen Hobbes åsikter direkt.<br/><br/>Locke däremot omfamnar maktdelning som en grundläggande princip i sin politiska teori. Hans argument för separationen är uppenbart i diskussionen om gränserna för den lagstiftande makten. Som Locke uttrycker det, skulle det knappast vara tillrådligt "för samma personer, som har befogenhet att stifta lagar, att ha också i sina händer befogenhet att verkställa dem" (76). Filosofen pekar på bristerna i den mänskliga naturen och den inneboende önskan att "gripa makten" som en anledning till denna försiktighetsåtgärd (Locke 76). Precis som i Hobbes fall härrör Lockes redogörelse för maktdelningen direkt från hans tolkning av naturtillståndet. Om det redan finns rättvisa i naturtillståndet och folket kan förstå det, är varje regering oundvikligen underkastad samma naturlag. Eftersom absolut makt över människor bryter mot båda begränsningarna i denna lag, är det lämpligt att separera och distribuera det så att regeringen skulle fungera på lämpligt sätt.<br/><br/>Detta papper har visat att medan skillnaderna mellan Hobbes och Lockes redogörelser för mänsklighetens naturliga tillstånd är många, utgör de i slutändan närvaron av frånvaro av moraliska premisser. Hobbes ser det naturliga tillståndet som den obegränsade friheten, där människor utrustade med lika möjligheter och inte bundna av några moraliska föreställningar, såsom rättvisa, konkurrerar om resurserna oupphörligt. Locke tolkar dock jämlikhet och frihet etiskt snarare än praktiskt och menar att krig är en perversion av det naturliga tillståndet, eftersom naturlagen tvingar människor att inte skada varandra. Denna oenighet påverkar filosofernas synsätt på regeringen. Hobbes insisterar på en allsmäktig härskare, eftersom, i avsaknad av etiska begränsningar, ingen annan myndighet kunde tvinga människor att avstå från att skada varandra. Ändå anser Locke att bevilja regeringen obegränsade befogenheter skulle strida mot de etiska begränsningar som finns i naturlagen, varför han, till skillnad från Hobbes, förespråkar maktdelning. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Vad Game of Thrones spydde upp<br/><br/>Kanadensisk-fransk sångare Abbas Hasan satte bländande ansträngning för att överglänsa hela mänskligheten på Fashion Parade 2014. Inget fel med det, förutom säkerhet är prioritet och musikern är en hälsorisk här.<br/><br/>Vi förstår att han vill bli en stjärna. Tyvärr fick han inte PM:et där de berättar för de desperata och ökända att stjärnstatus är en metafor. Du behöver inte se ut som en och bokstavligen sätta vår syn i brand. Dessutom har All Pakistan Aunty Association officiellt lämnat in ett klagomål mot honom. Den lokala marknaden har torkat av falska kristaller och sequined monstrosities. De har inget att bära till sina varannan vecka höga teer och de hävdar att han är skyldig. Tydligen är outfiten inspirerad av Game of Thrones. Kan han hålla sig till att komponera sorgliga låtar om sin grannes döda hund istället för att konceptualisera outfits? Eller kanske är det traumat att förlora hunden, vars död han är uppenbarligen inte över eftersom han fortfarande bär dess kadaver.<br/><br/>Laddningsarket Outfit<br/><br/>Ingen kan bestämma var outfiten börjar och var Abbas slutar. Du stirrar fascinerad, sjunker ner i en djup avgrund och undrar varför han bär läderbyxor. Vems häst dödade han för att stjäla sadeln draperad över axlarna? Var han i fängelse precis innan hans röda mattan utseende och glömde att ta bort kedjorna? Hur kommer han att överleva den syntetiska läder och post-sequin utslag som är skyldig att vara dödliga i så hög dos? Varför är jag fortfarande vid liv?<br/><br/>Idé<br/><br/>Hans inspiration var till synes Game of Thrones, men han slutade så småningom ser ut som han kastades ut från en Viking restaurang. Hade han stött på någon av karaktärerna från showen, skulle han ha dödats i de första fem sekunderna av det första avsnittet.<br/><br/>Den mentala hälsan eller bristen därav: Någon får honom till en rådgivare ASAP! Han verkar vara under antagandet att bära en död hund innebär att den enda vän han hade i sitt liv fortfarande lever. Kära Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Förnekelse är inte en flod i Egypten<br/><br/>2. Din torterade psyke hjälper inte din musik, så få hjälp<br/><br/>3. Försök imaginära vänner<br/><br/>Bail ut!<br/><br/>Alla vi på modepolisens högkvarter är allvarligt traumatiserade. Abbas är någon vi inte tyckte om att gripa. Han är för närvarande häktad och försöker hämnas genom att sätta på sig kläder från andra fantasishower. Han bara glitter limmade sig för att se ut som Edward Cullen från Twilight. Som ett public service-meddelande och för att förhindra ytterligare nervösa sammanbrott gav vi honom följande exempel på män från röda mattan av samma händelse.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>När du är osäker, spela det säkert. Sångaren ser ut som din genomsnittliga farbror på en shaadi. En vanlig svart kostym utan tillbehör, även om det är en smula oproportionerligt, är användbar. Zohaibs utseende är blandat i allt och ingenting, och när du inte har en modekänsla eller pengar för att anställa en stylist, är det okej. Det bär inte risken för hjärtstillestånd för andra deltagare på ett evenemang. Med tanke på Abbas ömtåliga mentala tillstånd är den här blicken vad han ska sikta på, alltid och för evigt.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>En dag, efter årtionden av terapi, kunde Abbas sträva efter att bära klädsel som Ali Zafars. Den snygga sommarlooken görs till nästan perfektion. Ali kom riktigt nära att se ut som en maetre d på en fransk restaurang med sin vita sommarjacka med svarta lapels, men skjortan sparar det, bry dig inte om satinen. Hans byxor skulle ha varit löjliga om de inte hade viks vid anklarna. Skorna är vad hipster chic happy endings är gjorda av. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Fastställande av markhydrauliska egenskaper med olika vätskevätskor : En avhandling som lämnats in i delvis uppfyllande av kraven för Master of Science vid Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Jordhydrauliska egenskaper som hydraulisk ledningsförmåga, vattenretention och växtvattenförhållanden dominerar vattenrörelseprocesserna. Till exempel infiltration, avdunstning och vattenflöde i jorden. Som ett utbrett fenomen i marken förändrar markvattenavstötningen markens hydrauliska funktioner genom att motstå vattenflödet i jorden. Dessutom beror de hydrauliska egenskaperna inte bara på jordens porsystem utan påverkas också av de fysikalisk-kemiska egenskaperna hos porytorna. Jämfört med vatten påverkas etanol inte av vattenavstötningen på grund av dess lägre ytspänning. Syftet med att använda etanol är att eliminera effekten av markvattenavstötning på mätningar av hydrauliska egenskaper. Att applicera ren etanol i naturlig jord kan dock försämra markens organiska material och leda till förändringar i fysiska egenskaper. Därför kan de vattenhaltiga etanollösningarna vara ett alternativ. Möjligheten att använda vattenhaltig etanol för att bestämma markens vätskeretentionskurva är fortfarande okänd. Denna studie syftar till att testa genomförbarheten av de vattenhaltiga etanollösningarna (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % och 100 % v/v) för att fastställa vätskeretentionskurvan under ett litet tryckintervall i grova sandprover med olika vätbarhet och organiskt modifierad naturlig jord (Templeton silt loam (TSL) med svampkompost, biokol, mejeriavlopp och kommunal kompost, applikationsgraden var 15 viktprocent). Resultatet visade att desorption av testning av vattenhaltiga etanollösningar jämfört med vatten var snabbare med ungefär 1 till 3x baserat på vätskeinnehållet vid samma applicerade tryck och tiden för att nå varje jämvikt. Resultaten från sandexperimentet tydde på att när koncentrationen av vattenlösning av etanol var under 50 % var förlusterna via avdunstning mindre än 1 % och de relativa skillnaderna mellan testvätska och vatten var lägre än 10 %. Avdunstningsförlusterna var dock 11,06 % och 24,6 %, och de relativa skillnaderna var alla omkring 15 % respektive 30 % i 50 % respektive 100 % etanollösning. Däremot ökade de organiska ändringarna i Templeton silt loam inte bara vattenretentionsförmågan utan minskade också avdunstningsförlusterna. Förångningsförlusterna i TSL-jord och TSL med organiska ändringar var med 1 % i lösningar med mindre än 50 % etanolhalt. Förångningsförlusterna på 50 % och 100 % etanol var 2,8 % respektive 2,9 %. De relativa skillnaderna mellan vatten och testvätska var liknande sandexperimentet när testvätskekoncentrationerna var under 50 %. De relativa skillnaderna i 50 % och 100 % etanollösning var dock mindre än i sandprovet med cirka 10 % respektive 15 %. Dessutom föreslog analysen av relativ skillnad att nästan alla vattenhaltiga etanollösningar hade lägre volymetrisk vätskehalt vid samma tillförda tryck jämfört med vatten, vilket var en reflektion av de vattenhaltiga etanollösningarna desorberade snabbare än vatten under motsvarande tryck. Därför skulle 10 % till 40 % av etanollösningarna kunna betraktas som ett alternativ för att bestämma markens hydrauliska egenskaper på grund av deras snabbare desorptionshastighet och inte påverkas av markens vattenavstötning. På grund av avdunstning och upplösning av organiskt material var vattenhaltiga etanollösningar över 50% koncentration inte lämpliga för grov sand eller medeltexturerad jord....
