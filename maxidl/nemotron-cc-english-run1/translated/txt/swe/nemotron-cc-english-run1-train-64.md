| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Genom Bibeln C2000 SeriesSkal vi vända oss till Apostlagärningarna, kapitel ett, när vi börjar vårt studium av den tidiga kyrkan.<br/>Lukas, författaren till Apostlagärningarna, en följeslagare till aposteln Paulus, som också var författare till Evangeliet Enligt Lukas, skrev dessa två avhandlingar till en vän, Theophilus. Theophilus är ett grekiskt namn. Det är ett namn som har en vacker betydelse. Namnet betyder älskare av Gud. Det finns några som tror att det inte var en människa alls, men att evangeliet och Apostlagärningarna riktades till älskare av Gud, vem du kan vara. Det finns andra traditioner som säger att Theofilos faktiskt var Lukes herre, att läkare på den tiden var slavar, vanligtvis slavar till en rik beskyddare. Så att Lukes mästare var Theophilus, och han släppte Luke för att vara med Paulus på missionsresorna. Således skriver Luke tillbaka till sin tidigare herre. Detta är en tidig tradition i kyrkan, men det är naturligtvis omöjligt att bevisa, som så många av traditionerna.<br/>Det finns också de som tror att när Paulus var i Troas och han fick en vision av en man som kallade till honom och sade: "Kom över till Makedonien och hjälp oss", att den mannen i Paulus vision var ingen annan än Luke. För den första som Paulus verkligen träffade när han kom till Makedonien var Lukas. Och som vi är i Apostlagärningarna, kommer du att finna att när vi kommer till den delen av Apostlagärningarna, Lukas börjar skriva mer i första person snarare än den tredje personen. Så det är tydligen vid denna punkt i Apostlagärningarna att Luke blev en följeslagare till Paulus och började resa med honom. Han började använda pronomen "vi" och "oss" i stället för "de" och "dem". Det här är utan tvekan där Luke blev en deltagare och ett ögonvittne till de saker som hände från och med nu. Vi kommer att föra ut detta till dig när vi kommer till den punkten.<br/>Han börjar Apostlagärningarna genom att binda det med evangeliet enligt Lukas. Det är intressant att det allra sista som Lukas registrerar i sitt evangelium är det allra första han registrerar i Apostlagärningarna. Vi finner att Lukas evangelium avslutas när Jesus säger till sina lärjungar att vänta i Jerusalem tills de är utrustade med kraft från höjden. Och sedan steg Jesus upp till himlen, och så stänger han evangeliet. När han öppnar Apostlagärningarna skriver han:<br/>Den förra avhandlingen [det vill säga evangeliet enligt Lukas] har jag skrivit till dig, o Teofilos, om allt som Jesus började både att göra och undervisa (Apg 1: 1),<br/>Nyckelordet börjar. Evangeliet Enligt Lukas är inte hela historien om Jesu Kristi tjänst. Det är bara början på Jesu Kristi tjänst. Jesus fortsätter att betjäna människors behov. Jesus fortsätter att bota de sjuka. Jesus fortsätter att uppväcka de döda. Jesus fortsätter att förmedla sin kärlek och sitt evangelium till världen, men nu betjänar han genom de lärjungar som har blivit smorda med hans Helige Ande. Men Kristi tjänst fortsätter; i grund och botten är den förutsättning som Lukas tar i Apostlagärningarna. Den tidigare avhandling av allt som Jesus började, både att göra och att undervisa.<br/>På grund av detta är Apostlagärningarna en oavslutad bok: i och med att Herren idag fortsätter att arbeta genom livet för dem som har ägnat sig åt att vara Guds instrument. Att bli ledd och vägledd och smord av sin Helige Ande, för att fortsätta Jesu tjänst i världen idag. Nu har Gud förordnat att hans arbete ska utföras genom mänskliga instrument. Jag säger inte att det måste utföras. Gud kan använda änglavarelser för sitt arbete, och det kommer en tid, under Uppenbarelseboken, då Gud kommer att använda änglar för att förkunna sitt evangelium för människor över hela världen. Uppenbarelseboken, kapitel 14, "Den första ängeln flyger genom mitten av himlen med det eviga evangeliet" (Upp 14:6). Men för närvarande har Gud valt att använda mänskliga instrument. Så ofullkomliga som de kan vara, men det är vad Gud har bestämt att använda. Det spännande med det är att Gud kommer att använda mig och Gud kommer att använda dig. Så många gånger tigger vi, "O Herre, jag kan inte tala. Jag har aldrig kunnat tala förr eller ens nu, Herre." Som Moses försökte tigga bort Guds kallelse. Jeremiah sa, "Herre, jag är bara ett barn; ingen kommer att lyssna på mig." Och vi har alla våra ursäkter för att vi inte kan användas. Eller hur? Vi vet alla varför Gud inte kunde använda oss.<br/>En gång, när Herren kallade en profet att utföra sitt verk, sade han: "Herre, sänd vem du vill." Herren sade: "Hej, jag har kallat dig." "Herre, god idé; sänd vem du vill." Så ofta är vi i den positionen, "Herre, sänd med vem du vill, någon annan än mig Herre." Och ändå har Gud bestämt att använda oss.<br/>Var och en av oss kan visa våra egna ofullkomligheter. Var och en av oss kan peka ut våra egna oförmåga, och vi kan alla hitta en ursäkt för varför Gud inte skulle vilja använda mig. Men ändå har Gud valt att använda dig. Du undrar när Gud har sådana instrument för att använda hur han fick jobbet gjort, eller hur?<br/>Fram till den dag då han togs upp, efter att han genom den Helige Ande hade gett bud till apostlarna som han hade valt (Apg 1:2):<br/>Det var vad han avslutade Lukasevangeliet med. Dagen då Jesus togs upp, efter att han hade sagt till apostlarna att vänta på kraftens gåva.<br/>För honom visade han sig också [det är apostlarna han också] levande för dem efter sin passion [eller död] genom många ofelbara bevis (Apg 1: 3),<br/>Det är svårt att förneka det faktum att Jesu Kristi uppståndelse. Jag var underhållande, liksom irriterad och irriterad, av en artikel jag läste i Santa Ana-registret förra lördagen. Av de skapelsevetenskaper och evolutionsteorier som presenteras i länsskolorna. Hur det, den här professorn sa att han undervisar i en vetenskapsklass, och därmed handlar de bara om fakta, och att de inte har någon plats för teorier. Eftersom vetenskapen är baserad på fakta och skapelsen är baserad på religiös vidskepelse. Det tar mycket tro att tro på de religiösa teorierna. När du har att göra med fakta, kan du bara acceptera dem. Jag tänkte, "Mycket intressant i den där vetenskapsklassen, de lärde mig att det var ett faktum att världen var fyra miljarder år gammal. Nu idag lär de ut att det är ett faktum att världen är tolv miljarder år gammal. Och det var inte så länge sedan jag gick i skolan."<br/>Det är intressant att Bibeln aldrig har behövt revideras eller uppdateras för att möta de aktuella uppgifterna som män har upptäckt. Och ändå, om du skulle ta mina high school science läroböcker idag och försöka undervisa en vetenskapsklass från dem, skulle du upptäcka att många av de saker som lärdes ut som vetenskapliga fakta när jag var i gymnasiet inte längre erkänns som vetenskapliga fakta. Den enkla cellprotoplasman är inte längre en enkel cell, utan extremt komplex. Om det finns något faktum som kan intygas i historien är det det faktum att Jesu Kristi uppståndelse från de döda.<br/>Vi har ett rättssystem som bygger på vittnesmål. Om en man anklagas för ett brott och det finns människor som bevittnade det brottet medan det begicks, och de förs till normen, och de svär att säga sanningen, hela sanningen, och ingenting annat än sanningen, så hjälp dem Gud. Och i deras förhör de bekräftar att, "Jag såg att mannen i banken den tjugotredje maj. Jag såg honom dra ut en pistol från sin rock. Jag hörde honom kräva att alla pengar ges till honom. Jag såg honom när han lämnade banken. Jag såg honom som officeren grep honom utanför." Och om du kan få tre eller fyra vittnen att peka på den mannen och kommer att hålla sitt vittnesmål under korsförhör, den mannen bedöms vara skyldig. Han är den som gjorde det. Vi har två eller tre vittnen som vittnar om samma sak, och det är accepterat att det är han som begått brottet och är skyldig.<br/>Efter Jesu död, när han uppstod igen, visade han sig för många olika människor som gav svurit vittnesbörd om att de såg honom. Att de talade med honom, att han visade sig för dem på olika ställen under olika omständigheter. Och under en period av fyrtio dagar var på besök med dem. Och på en gång, upp till så många som fem hundra människor som var samlade på ett ställe, visade han sig. Det är svårt att bara kasta undan eller förneka dessa människors vittnesbörd. Att göra det är att misskreditera hela vårt rättsvetenskapliga system. Men inte bara det, dessa män som vittnade om att de såg den uppståndne Herren, att de talade med Honom, att de åt med Honom, de, alla, med undantag av en, mötte våldsam död i händerna på andra människor på grund av att de bekräftade att historien de berättade var sann. Ni talar om vittnen som svurit att säga sanningen, hela sanningen, inget annat än sanningen. De skulle ha erkänt hela bluffen. "Han visade sig levande efter sin passion genom många ofelbara bevis."<br/>som ses av dem i fyrtio dagar, talar till dem om de saker som hör till Guds rike (Apg 1:3):<br/>Ibland klandrar vi lärjungarna på grund av deras frågor om tidpunkten för Guds rike. Låt oss komma ihåg att Guds rike var Jesu Kristi favoritämne. Han talade alltid om Guds rike, och det är ett stort hopp att han planterade in i alla människors hjärtan. Saker och ting kommer inte alltid att fortsätta vara fördärvade som de är. Världen kommer inte att gå för evigt under mörkrets makt, under ondskans träldom. Gud kommer att en dag upprätta sitt rike på jorden. Ett rike av rättfärdig glädje och fred. "Jesus skall härska, innan solen går sin gång, och hans rike skall sträcka sig från strand till strand." Och den dagen kommer att bli den mest härliga dagen världen någonsin har sett, som sjukdom och lidande och smärta kommer att avskaffas i hans rike. Som synd och girighet och dessa saker som har gjort världen en sådan outhärdlig plats kommer att avskaffas i hans rike. Den gudlösa kommersialismen, exploateringen av människan, alla dessa saker avskaffades i hans härliga rike när han regerar. Inte konstigt att lärjungarna var angelägna om att få det på. Jag är angelägen om att få det på; Jag är angelägen om att hans rike ska komma. Och Jesus sa till oss när vi ber, den första bönen är, "Ditt rike kommer. Din vilja ske på jorden, som det är i himlen" (Matt 6:10). Detta är den rätta typen av en önskan som vi alla borde ha. Jag önskar Guds rike. Och så talade han till dem, under denna fyrtio dagars tid, om riket.<br/>Och då han var samlad med dem, befallde han dem att inte vika från Jerusalem, utan vänta på löftet från Fadern, som, säger han, ni har hört talas om mig (Apg 1:4).<br/>Han sade: ”Se, här i Jerusalem skall ni vänta tills ni får Faderns löfte.” Detta löfte som han syftar på är utan tvekan löftet i Joel där Herren lovade: "Och det skall ske i de senare dagarna, säger Herren, att jag skall utgjuta min Ande över allt kött, och era söner och döttrar skall profetera, och era unga män skall drömma drömmar, era gamla män skall se syner: och över mina tjänare och mina tjänarinnor skall jag utgjuta min Ande, säger Herren "(Jo 2:28-29). Faderns löfte: den dag kommer då Gud kommer att utgjuta sin Ande över allt kött, alla troende. De kommer, var och en, att ta emot denna dynamik från Gud.<br/>Ty Johannes döpte i sanning med vatten, men ni skall döpas med den helige Ande om inte många dagar (Apg 1:5).<br/>Idén om dopet var att uppstå, bapteedzo. John döpte med vatten, nedsänkt folket i vatten, "du kommer att vara nedsänkt i den Helige Ande i inte många dagar."<br/>När de nu hade kommit tillsammans, frågade de honom och sade: Herre, vill du i denna tid åter upprätta riket åt Israel?<br/>"När kommer det att bli, Herre? När är det dags för denna återställelse?" Och Jesus talar till dem nu, inte om riket, utan om den kraft som de kommer att få för tjänst. Och så borstar han bort sin fråga.<br/>Och han sade till dem: Det tillkommer inte er att känna till de tider eller tider som Fadern har lagt i sin egen makt (Apg 1:7).<br/>"Det är inte för dig att veta." De levde ständigt i väntan på den omedelbara upprättandet av riket. Under hela Jesu livstid förväntade de sig att han när som helst skulle gå in i telefonkiosken och komma ut som världens frälsare. Shazzam! Visar sin makt och störtar världens regeringar, upprättar Guds rike på jorden. Och de väntade dagligen på att denna förändring skulle ske. Och närhelst Jesus talade om att gå till Jerusalem, bli överlämnad i den syndiga människans händer, och sedan bli korsfäst, "Åh, åh nej, Herre. Nej, nej, du förstår inte riket, Herre. Var så långt ifrån dig." När Jesus dog på korset blev de alla mycket besvikna.<br/>De båda lärjungarna på vägen till Emmaus, så ledsna. »Hallå, karlar, hur kommer det sig, att ni är så ledsna som att ni går med?» »Vad menar ni? Ni måste vara en främling här omkring, om ni inte vet vad som har hänt på sista tiden i Jerusalem.» »Vad då?» "Åh, en man vid namn Jesus från Nasaret ... åh människa, det var mäktigt och kraftfullt. Guds smörjelse var över hans liv. Vi hade hoppats att i honom var befrielsen av Israel, men de korsfäste honom. Vi hade hoppats ... nu är det dött. " Nu är Han uppstånden, och Han säger: "Om några dagar, karlar, skall ni få Faderns löfte." "Åh, vilket löfte? Löftet om rikets upprättande?" Du förstår, det var legitimt att de skulle fråga. "Är det här Herre? Okej! Är det här tiden? Ska du upprätta ditt rike nu?" "Nej. Det är inte för dig att veta de tider som Fadern har utsett eller som Fadern har i sin egen kraft. Men du kommer att få kraft när den Helige Ande har kommit över dig. "<br/>Här används den grekiska prepositionen epi för att beteckna ett nytt förhållande som de skulle ha med den Helige Ande. I Johannesevangeliet, kapitel 14, som Jesus är där lovande att sända den Helige Ande, sade han: "Jag skall inte lämna er tröstlösa. Jag skall komma till er, och jag skall be Fadern, och han skall sända till er en annan tröstare, nämligen sanningens Ande, som världen inte kan ta emot, eftersom den inte ser honom och inte heller känner honom, utan ni känner honom, ty han bor hos er, och han skall vara i er” (Joh 14:17-18). Samma grekiska preposition som vår, bara de stavar det "en" i stället för "i". Tvåfaldig relation där i Johannes: Han är med dig, men han kommer att bo i dig. Men nu sa Jesus att du kommer att få kraft när den Helige Ande kommer över dig. Den grekiska preposition epi, som översätts i olika texter i hela Nya testamentet som "på" eller "över" eller jag gillar det, "överflöden".<br/>I det sjunde kapitlet i Johannesevangeliet: "På den sista dagen, den stora festdagen, när Jesus stod där på Tempelberget och ropade till folket: 'Om någon törstar, låt honom komma till mig och dricka; och den som dricker av det vatten som jag ger, ur hans innersta skall det strömma levande vatten.'" Johannes sade: "Detta talade han om Anden, som ännu inte var given som de som tror på honom skulle få" (Joh 7:37-39). Vad talade han om Anden? Att det skulle vara som en ström av levande vatten som strömmar ut. Jag gillar, "När Anden flödar över dig," över dig, eller över dig, eller flödar från dig. Så det trefaldiga förhållandet: Han är med dig före din omvändelse, han är den som får dig att inse att du är en syndare, han är den som pekar på Jesus Kristus som svaret när han övertygar världen om synd, om rättfärdig och om dom. I det ögonblick du öppnar ditt liv och hjärta för Jesus Kristus och inbjuder Honom att komma in, kommer den Helige Ande och börjar dväljas i dig. Han skall vara i dig. "Vet ni inte att ni inte är era egna, ni har blivit köpta med ett pris, förhärliga därför Gud i er kropp och er ande som är hans. Och vet ni inte att er kropp är den Helige Andes tempel som är i er? Var inte berusad av vin, vari är överflöd, utan fylls, eller fylls med Anden" (1 Kor 6:19-20, Ef 5:18). Men nu är här ett tredje förhållande. Detta är en bemyndigande upplevelse.<br/>Ni kommer att få dynamiken, när den Helige Ande har kommit över er [eller över er, eller när det finns det överflöd från er]: och ni skall vara vittnen till mig (Apg 1:8)<br/>Och så dynamiken, att vara ett vittne om Jesus Kristus. Det är intressant att ordet vittne på grekiska är ordet martus varifrån vi får vårt ord martyr. Och på grekiska betyder det martyr. Ett vittne är en som inte bara förkunnar vad han tror, han lever vad han tror, han är vad han tror, och han tror det så starkt, att om det behövs, kommer han att dö för vad han tror. Det är hur stark är hans tro. Han är en martus. Han är inte rädd för att dö för det han tror på.<br/>Du kommer ihåg när Paulus var på väg tillbaka till Jerusalem och Agabus kom ner från Caesarea och han tog Paulus bälte och band sig och han sa: "Så är mannen som äger detta bälte att vara bunden när han kommer till Jerusalem." Och Pauls vänner började gråta och sade: "Åh, Paul, gå inte, gå inte." Och han sa: "Vad menar du med dessa tårar? Tror du att du kommer att avråda mig? Tror du att jag är orolig för att bli bunden? Jag är redo att dö." Han var en martus. "Jag är redo att dö." Att dödas för din tro gjorde dig inte till en martyr; eftersom du var en martyr, dödades du. Eftersom du var ett vittne, eftersom du trodde det så starkt. Så det gjorde dig inte till ett vittne, det bevisade bara vad du var. Du var ett vittne hela tiden. Om du inte hade varit en martus, skulle du aldrig ha gått till din död. Du skulle ha recanted; du skulle ha sagt, "Whoa, whoa, vänta, vänta. Vänta, låt oss ändra kurs här. Jag tror att jag kan ha gjort ett misstag." Då säger du, "Nå, han var inte en martus. Att stjäla en häst gör dig inte till en hästtjuv; det bevisar bara att du var. Ingen stjäl en häst om han inte är en hästtjuv. Så att stjäla det gör dig inte till en hästtjuv, det bevisar bara att du var med hela tiden. Att bli martyr bevisar bara vad du var ett vittne, en martus. "Och ni kommer att vara vittnen." Och är det inte intressant att de flesta av dem blev martyrer? "Vittnen till mig."<br/>Vittnet skulle vara både i Jerusalem och i hela Judeen (Apg 1:8),<br/>Vittnet började hemma. Det svåraste stället, eller hur? Det är att börja hemma i Jerusalem, och sedan området runt Jerusalem, Judeen. Och sedan var det att sprida sig till Samarien. Och sedan var det att gå ut i de yttersta delarna av världen. Och när vi studerar Apostlagärningarna, kommer vi att se just denna progression. Hur vittnet började i Jerusalem. Vi kommer att få det i nästa kapitel. Och så får vi se hur det började sprida sig genom hela Judeen. Och sedan gick Phillip upp till Samarien, och sedan slutligen Paulus och Barnabas kallas att gå in i de yttersta delarna av världen. Och så spred sig vittnet genom smörjelsen och den Helige Andes kraft.<br/>Men när han hade sagt detta, lyftes han upp, medan de sågo det; och en sky tog honom bort ifrån deras åsyn (Apg 1:9).<br/>Detta är det sista löftet som Jesus gav till sina lärjungar. Detta är det, de sista orden före hans himmelsfärd. Naturligtvis kom han senare och pratade med Paulus och andra, men före hans himmelsfärd är detta hans sista ord. Och på detta, när han hade sagt dessa saker, medan de tittade på honom, togs han upp och en molnskyn tog honom ur deras åsyn.<br/>Och medan de såg stadigt mot himlen när han gick upp, se, det var två män som stod bredvid dem i vita kläder (Apg 1:10).<br/>Vi antar att de var änglar.<br/>Som också sade: "Ni män i Galileen, varför står ni och tittar upp till himlen? denne Jesus, som har tagits upp från er till himlen, skall så komma på samma sätt som ni har sett honom gå upp till himlen (Apg 1:11).<br/>De såg honom när han steg upp till himlen och de kommer att se honom när han kommer igen. "Se Herren kommer med tiotusentals av sina heliga, för att verkställa domen på jorden" (Dom 1:14-15). Till honom som har älskat oss och gett sig själv för oss och som har gjort oss till kungar och präster åt vår Gud, som skall regera med honom på jorden, se, Herren kommer, och varje öga skall se honom, och även de som har genomborrat honom skall sörja. Så Herrens ankomst. Varje öga skall se Honom. Jehovas Vittnen säger att Han redan har kommit, men det var en hemlig ankomst. Som det var bara lärjungarna som såg Honom gå, var det bara lärjungarna, av Jehovas Vittnen, som såg Honom återvända. Men Jesus sade: "Om de säger till er: 'Han har kommit i det fördolda och har gått in i en hemlig kammare, tro det inte'" (Matt 24:26). Så ni måste välja, att tro Jesus eller dem.<br/>"Denne Jesus, som har blivit upptagen från er till himlen, han skall komma på samma sätt som ni har sett honom fara upp till himlen."<br/>Nu finns det en mycket intressant vers i II John, vers Apostlagärningarna 1:7, "För många bedragare har kommit in i världen som bekänner inte att Jesus Kristus har kommit i köttet." Det är tyvärr en dålig översättning av grekiskan. För detta particip är i presens och bör översättas "kommer i köttet." De som skulle förneka att Jesus Kristus kommer i köttet. Vad säger Johannes om dem? "De är en bedragare och en antikrist. Se till eder själva, så att vi icke förlora det som vi hava gjort, utan få full lön; ty var och en som överträder och icke förbliver i Kristi lära, han har icke Gud. Den som förbliver i Kristi lära, han har både Fadern och Sonen. Och om det kommer någon till din dörr (på lördag morgon) och inte kommer med denna lära, ta inte emot honom i ditt hus, och inte heller säga honom farväl. För den som bjuder honom farväl är en delaktig av hans onda gärningar" (2 Joh 1:7-11). Ställ dem en fråga, "Är Jesus kommer i köttet?" Bara fråga dem den frågan. Och om de säger nej, bara komma ihåg vad John varnade dig och vad John berättade för dig. "Om någon inte bekänner att Jesus Kristus kommer i köttet." Kommer du ihåg när han var med lärjungarna och han sa: "Ge mig något att äta?" Han sa: "Du vet, andar äter inte; rör mig. Ser du? Det är jag." Jesus kommer igen på samma sätt som de såg honom fara upp till himlen, och jag tror att det kommer mycket snart.<br/>Sedan flyttade de till Jerusalem från det berg som kallas Olivberget och som ligger från Jerusalem, en dagsresa på sabbaten. Och när de hade kommit in, gingo de upp i en sal på övervåningen, där de bodde: Petrus, Jakob, Johannes, Andreas, Filippus, Tomas, Bartolomeus, Matteus, Jakob, Alfeus' son, Simon Seloten och Judas, Jakobs broder. Och alla dessa fortsatte i endräkt i bön och åkallan, med kvinnorna och Maria, Jesu mor, och med sina bröder (Apg 1:12-14).<br/>Detta är det sista omnämnandet av Maria, Jesu mor. Vid denna tidpunkt och från denna punkt, finns det inget ytterligare omnämnande av henne i Apostlagärningarna eller i epistlarna. Inget omnämnande av hennes död eller av hennes mirakulösa uppstigning till himlen, utan död. Ingenting nämns i skriften. Det är tyst.<br/>Hans bröder skulle vara en hänvisning förmodligen till James och Judas och till de andra bröder som var söner till Josef och Maria.<br/>Det övre rummet - det finns några som säger att det är samma övre rum där Jesus hade den sista måltiden med sina lärjungar. Och ändå finns det andra som håller till detta övre rum är ett rum i templet precincts där den tidiga kyrkan träffades. Välj själv.<br/>Och i dessa dagar Petrus stod upp mitt bland lärjungarna, och sade, (antalet av deras namn tillsammans var ungefär etthundratjugo,) män och bröder, måste detta Skriften nödvändigtvis ha uppfyllts, som den Helige Ande genom Davids mun talade innan om Judas, som var en guide till dem som tog Jesus (Apg 1:15-16).<br/>De väntar i bön och åkallan, och Peter står upp och säger, "Vänner, det finns ett skriftställe som måste uppfyllas." Och du vet att han kommer att gå vidare, "Låt oss få igång programmet; låt oss kasta lott och ta reda på vem som ska ta Judas plats." Jag känner att Petrus återigen var i köttet och manifesterade den häftiga naturen som var hans. Och jag tror att kyrkans framtida historia i Apostlagärningarna pekar på detta. Jag är intresserad av Peters förståelse av skrifterna, hur han citerar från så många ställen i Gamla Testamentet. Peter visar en mycket stor förståelse av Gamla testamentets skrifter som är en punkt i hans favör.<br/>Lägg märke till att Petrus tillskriver den Helige Ande de saker som David skrev. Så att "Hela skriften ges genom inspiration från Gud" (2Ti 3:16 ). Inte en del av skrifterna. För om du säger att en del av skrifterna är inspirerade av Gud, då måste jag fråga dig, "Vilka delar är genom inspiration och vilka delar är inte genom inspiration?" Och så är du auktoriteten som talar om för mig vilken del jag kan tro och vilken del jag inte kan tro och så fort Gud inte längre är auktoriteten men du är auktoriteten, är jag i trubbel. Akta er för dem som säger: "Tja, ni kan inte tro på alla skrifterna." Skrifterna själva säger: "Hela skriften är inspirerad av Gud." Och här, Lukas i skrift om vad Petrus sa, förklarar att David var faktiskt talesman för den Helige Ande. Den Helige Ande, genom Davids mun, talade om Judas.<br/>För han räknades med oss, [han var en av de tolv] han hade fått en del av detta ämbete. Men nu köpte denne man ett fält med lön för missgärning, och faller huvudstupa (Apg 1:17-18 ),<br/>Han köpte fältet, krukmakarens fält som Zachariah den elfte kapitlet förklarar.<br/>och föll huvudstupa, brast han sönder i mitten, och alla hans inälvor forsade ut (Apg 1:18).<br/>Det finns de som finner en motsägelse i skrifterna, för i ett av evangelierna får vi veta att när Judas kom tillbaka och försökte lämna tillbaka pengarna, sa de, "Hej, det är ditt problem. Vi kan inte ta det." Och lägg tillbaka det i templets skattkammare. "Det är blod pengar." Sedan kastade han den där på golvet i templet och han gick ut och hängde sig. Här berättar Peter att han föll huvudstupa och bara poppade. Och det finns de som föreställer sig en avvikelse. Mycket enkelt gick han upp i trädet för att hänga sig, band repet runt halsen och band det till lemmen och hoppade. Och kraften i fallet antingen knäppte repet eller huvudet, och han föll ner i kanjonen och precis som han sa det här.<br/>Det var känt för alla invånare i Jerusalem, så att fältet kallas på deras tunga, Aceldama, det vill säga, fältet blod. Ty det är skrivet i Psaltaren: Låt hans boning vara öde, och låt ingen människa bo däri: och, Hans biskoprick låt en annan ta (Apg 1:19-20).<br/>Nu i verkligheten han citerar från två olika Psaltaren här. Från Ps 69:25, sätter han ihop det med Ps 109:8. Och sätta de två tillsammans han finner dessa profetior om Judas.<br/>Därför av dessa män (Apg 1:21)<br/>Nu är det här de letar efter någon att ta Judas plats för att vara en apostel. Här är de kvalifikationer som de letade efter i den tiden.<br/>Därför av dessa män som har varit med oss hela tiden att Herren Jesus när in och ut bland oss (Apg 1:21),<br/>Nu kommer ni ihåg att det var många lärjungar, många lärjungar som Jesus valde tio att vara apostlar. Och ordet apostel betyder "en som är utsänd." Eller valde tolv att vara apostlar, så han sände ut de tolv. Antalet mänskliga regeringen. "Vi har bara elva. Vi behöver en för att ta Judas plats, men vi behöver en som har varit med oss hela tiden från början med Jesus."<br/>Från den tid han döptes av Johannes, till den dag han togs upp från oss, måste man ordineras att vara ett vittne [om vad?] av hans uppståndelse (Apg 1:22).<br/>Så dessa var de krav som de letade efter. Någon som hade varit runt hela tiden. Från tiden för Johannes dop till uppstigningen. Och en som såg den uppståndne Herren, och därmed kunde bära faktumet om uppståndelsen, deras vittnesbörd om faktumet.<br/>Nu Paulus aposteln, senare i att hävda det faktum att han var en apostel sade: "Har jag inte sett den uppståndne Kristus?" Uppenbarligen var det en av kraven på apostlaskap. Någon frågade mig, "Finns det apostlar i dag?" Tja, jag vet inte. Jag tror inte att det finns i samma mening som de var i Nya Testamentet. Säkert finns det ingen idag som kan vittna om uppståndelsen som de gjorde.<br/>De utsåg två, Joseph kallas Barsabas, som hette Justus, och Matthias. Och de bad, och sade: Du, Herre, som känner hjärtan alla män, visa om av dessa två som du har valt (Apg 1:23-24),<br/>Jag tror att vi ofta gör misstaget att ge Herren två val, båda fel. Att begränsa Gud, förstår du. Vi är så benägna att göra det här. Uppenbarligen var Paul Guds val. Peter var impulsiv och hoppade med pistolen och sa: "Hej, vi måste göra något, du vet, måste hjälpa Gud ut. Du vet, en saknas och vi måste fylla i honom." Och ändå, "Gud, vilken av dessa två vill du ha?" Och ge Gud de två valen.<br/>Att han kan ta del av denna tjänst och detta apostlaämbete, från vilket Judas genom överträdelsen föll, så att han kunde gå till sin egen plats. Och så gav de ut sin lott (Apg 1:25-26);<br/>Ett intressant sätt genom vilket de försökte bestämma Guds vilja. Låt oss kasta tärningar, ta reda på vad Guds vilja är här. Det är intressant för mig, de olika sätt som människor har tänkt ut för att urskilja Guds vilja. Nu, i Gamla Testamentets tider hade de ett intressant sätt att komma till prästen, som skulle fråga Herren för dem genom Urim och Tummim, "ljusen och fullkomligheterna." Precis vad dessa Urim och Tummim var, vet vi inte. Jag är säker på att de inte var de färgade glasögon som Joseph Smith hittade med Golden Tablets; de magiska glasögonen, att när du sätter dem på, kunde du plötsligt läsa den hieroglyfiska skriften.<br/>Det finns de som säger att urim och tummim var faktiskt en svart och en vit sten som bars i en påse på bröstet av prästen. De skulle be och ställa Herren en viss fråga. Du kommer ihåg att David frågade Herren bestämda frågor: "Herre, ska vi gå ut mot filistéerna?" Svaret var, "Nej." Så igen, nästa dag, "Herre, ska vi gå ut mot filistéerna?" Svaret var, "Ja." "När ska vi gå?" De skulle ställa specifika frågor, och Herren skulle rikta dem genom urim och tummin. De säger att prästen skulle be, söka Gud, och sedan nå in och dra ut en av de två stenarna. Om det var den vita stenen, var det ett ja svar. Om det var ett nej, då skulle det vara den svarta stenen som han skulle dra ut. Vissa säger till och med att vi får termen blackballed från denna Urim och Thummim. Faktiskt, tillbaka i originalet är det en nej-röst mot ett visst projekt eller en idé. Exakt vad urim och tummim var vet vi inte, men under Gamla Testamentets period använde de en metod för att kasta lott för att bestämma Guds vilja.<br/>Så här plockar lärjungarna upp samma sak som de kastar tärningarna för att se vilken av de två männen som Gud hade valt att ersätta Judas Iskariot.<br/>lotten föll på Mattias, han räknades med de elva (Apg 1:26).<br/>Vem i hela världen är Matthias? Ingen har hört talas om honom förr eller senare. Det ska bli intressant att träffa Matthias och ta reda på vem han är och vad han gjorde. Jag tror från den efterföljande historien, det är uppenbart att anta att Gud valde Paulus som apostel. Paulus förklarar det själv. Nu är det sista gången vi någonsin läser om dem som försöker urskilja Guds vilja genom att kasta lott eller av en slump något.<br/>Jag vet att en man i dag, när han försöker urskilja Herrens vilja, kommer att be och ställa en fråga till Herren. Han kommer att ha tio pennies i fickan, och när han ber, tar han pennies med ögonen stängda och lägger ner dem på bordet, och om de alla kommer upp huvuden, är det ett ja. En intressant sak, då och då kommer de alla upp huvuden, och det är ganska bra odds. Men vi hittar inget mönster för detta efter att den Helige Ande gavs. När den Helige Ande kom över kyrkan, då den Helige Ande började tala till dem och styra dem. Och den Helige Ande sade: "Separera till mig Paul och Barnabas för tjänsten där jag har kallat dem" (Apg 13:2). Och den Helige Ande sände ut dem. Så vi finner kyrkan mer direkt styrd av den Helige Ande. När den Helige Ande kom, kastade denna tärning för att ta reda på Guds vilja sattes åt sidan.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>Detta är 1769 King James Version av Bibeln (även känd som den auktoriserade versionen).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Faktum är att dynamiska drivrutiner fungerar exakt på samma sätt som dynamiska mikrofoner men omvänt. Inuti en dynamisk drivrutin finns en magnet, och när du ansluter hörlurarna skickar du en AC-ström genom den som kommer att göra röstspolen till en magnet. Beroende på riktningen på strömmen kommer magnetens polaritet att förändras. Nu eftersom vi vet för en magnet, samma laddningar avvisar och olika laddningar lockar, vet vi att röstspolen kommer att röra sig fram och tillbaka beroende på dess polaritet vid den tiden. Talspolen är fäst vid membranet som sedan kommer att röra sig fram och tillbaka och skapa en ljudvåg. Detsamma sker i omvänd, om du flyttar en spole genom en magnet producerar du en ström istället.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Gabor T Rittersporn sade: "Många av offren var uppriktigt hängivna bolsjevismens principer." Detta förstärker beviset för att de bolsjevikiska idealen som en gång hade varit kommunistpartiets rötter var oordnade och förstördes av utrensningarna. Partiet var utarmat och före detta medlemmar såg hjälplöst på när Stalin använde den stora utrensningen som ett verktyg för att förvandla Ryssland från en enpartistat till en obestridd diktatur.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell är nerfing brawlers istället för nerfing stjärnkrafter. Jag var på 750 förra säsongen med makt 8 nita och det är väldigt svårt att gå förbi det, som, stjärnkrafter spelar en riktigt dominerande roll. Matchmaking är också skräp. När jag spelar gem grab (cirka 600 troféer) finns det ofta matchups där fiendens lag har en mer spelare än oss som är maxad och det är inte ens att vi har en lvl 9 att tävla mot det. Ibland finns det även matchups där fiendelaget är fullt maxat och ingen av oss är det. Det är därför jag inte spelar slagsmålsstjärnor på allvar längre. Det är inte ens som det finns många spelare som inte är maxade och runt 600 troféer. Det är irriterande.<br/>Edit: Jag tycker att supercell borde ha åtminstone en grundläggande mekanism som tar genomsnittet av nivåer av slagsmål när du ställer in matcher.<br/><br/>Förutom troféer indikerar inte riktigt din skicklighet. De indikerar skickligheten hos lagkamraterna du placeras med. Och jag är bra med att spela mot högre nivå bråkare, men när ett lag är alla nivå 10 och det andra laget är inte, klart det är obalanserad.<br/><br/>Jag rekommenderar att få några goda vänner att spela med, jag och 2 vänner fick mina vänner makt 1 kryssa för att ranka 28 genom att spela pärla grab med en viss sammansättning hela dagen och vi gjorde det utan att en enda av oss var maxad med våra brawlers.<br/><br/>Jag vet hur du känner att jag brukade ha brawlers i höga troféer med låg nivå och det är för svårt att gå längre och allt jag sa till mig själv "Jag vill ha stjärnkrafter" behöver verkligen göra balans till stjärnkrafterna eller åtminstone göra ett bättre matchmaking-system.<br/><br/>Jag känner det här. Jag är inte lika bra på spelet som du, men jag fick Emz till 500 vid makt 1 och matchmaking var hemskt. Maxed ut spelare överallt! Och det hjälpte inte att majoriteten av mina lagkamrater hade runt 5-8k troféer ... Jag var tvungen att ta till solo showdown i sista minuten eftersom jag antingen kan ligga i bakhåll intet ont anande spelare eller helt enkelt spela lite aggressiv vid rätt tidpunkter. Men jag önskar verkligen att det kunde vara lite lättare för människor som vill driva brawlers till riktigt höga troféområden utan att ha lyxen av stjärnkrafter.<br/><br/>Altho spike är fortfarande bra utan curveball. Curveball var bara en hjälp för att slå dina skott oftare som spike. Men redan innan curveball släpptes, spike var en riktigt stark bråkmakare, så han kommer att förbli densamma nu.<br/><br/>Jag håller med om att de borde ha nerfed bakhåll, men jag tror att de försöker balansera både Snappy Sniping och Ambush, eftersom de båda blir samman med denna förändring. Hon blev lite kraftfull, men fortfarande inte nervvärdig<br/><br/>Jag är inte säker på det här, men nu när Darryl fick en märkbar buff, tittar på deras nya statistik, ser det ut som att Darryl kan överskugga Bull, eftersom han inte bara alltid kan hantera mer skada än Bull, han kommer inte att dö så tidigt längre, så deras överlevnadsförmåga kommer att vara liknande utan stjärnkraft (även om Bulls överlevnadsförmåga fortfarande är märkbart bättre än Darryls om han hade Tuff Guy). Inte bara det, Darryls super kan auto regenerera, vilket betyder att Darryl KAN spela effektivt både som en tungviktare och en mördare samtidigt (innan han suger som en tungviktare men anständig som en mördare)<br/><br/>Men han är överskattad af. Och du får troféer med honom verkligen lätt. Så im kinda ok med nerv. Jag har inte ens spelat honom sedan när jag fick honom till 500 (cirka 5 månader sedan), så inte att jag bryr mig så mycket heller.<br/><br/>Varför får inte Poco/Penny en HP nerf, om de är Marksman/Healer respektive inte en tank?<br/>Varför är inte Rosas tankyness nerfed, hosta 70% skadereduktion?<br/>Varför är Tick tillåtet att ha den högsta räckvidden och den mest fria pokedamage i hela spelet?<br/>Varför får inte Leon en HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Hur som helst, det var Ambush som var OP, inte bas Piper. Jag skulle hävda att Ambush är den bästa stjärnkraften i spelet (nu ännu mer eftersom andelen skador ökar indirekt gick upp) och bas Piper var en botten-10 bråkmakare.<br/><br/>Vad Supercell bör göra är att återställa båda nerverna, minska Ambush till 600 och minska Snappy Sniping till 0,25 eftersom det indirekt skulle buffras av basskadorna.<br/><br/>Ja och jag tror att de gick lite för långt med Rosa, för nu är hon i princip den bättre tjuren nu när det gäller tankning, vilket hon har varit ett tag. Nu kan Darryl lika gärna vara en mindre, mer kraftfull tjur<br/><br/>Varför? Jag känner att hon behöver en buff i nästan allt utom hennes stjärnkraft. Hennes hälsa och hastighet gör henne super lite svårare att använda, eftersom hon kan dö ganska lätt, och det är verkligen svårt för henne att fånga snabbare slagsmål som Crow. Stjärnornas makt är lite trasig... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Egenföretagande del 1<br/><br/>När du accepterar en anställning i någon organisation måste du utföra olika jobb enligt din arbetsgivares krav och du kan få ett fast inkomstbelopp som lön. Du kan driva en liten butik, skräddarsy butik, restaurang, bageri och konfektyr, skönhetssalong etc. i din ort. Du kan engagera dig i handel eller tillverkning i liten skala eller tillhandahålla någon service till ett pris. Sådan verksamhet kallas egenföretagande.<br/><br/>Innebörden av egenföretagande<br/><br/>Vår far, mor, bröder, systrar och andra kan vara engagerade i olika ekonomiska aktiviteter genom vilka de tjänar sitt uppehälle. Dessa personer bedriver en ekonomisk verksamhet som kallas lönearbete eller avlönad anställning. Men det finns många personer som ägnar sig åt ett yrke eller något företag som de startar och driver på egen hand. De gör sitt bästa och tar alla typer av risker för att lyckas med sin karriär. Hela förtjänsten av deras arbete går till dem. Vi har alla sett små livsmedelsbutiker, skräddarbutiker, medicinska butiker etc. i vår lokalitet. Dessa ägs och förvaltas av en person, med eller utan hjälp av några assistenter. Deras ekonomiska verksamhet kallas egenföretagande. Så när en individ engagerar sig i någon ekonomisk verksamhet och hanterar den på egen hand, kallas det egenföretagande.<br/><br/>Mål<br/><br/>Efter att ha studerat denna lektion kommer du att kunna:<br/><br/>Bild från Objectives<br/><br/>Bild från Objectives<br/><br/>Kännetecken för egenföretagande<br/><br/>Det innebär ägande och förvaltning av aktiviteter av en person, även om han / hon kan ta hjälp av en eller två personer för att hjälpa honom / henne. Således kan egenföretagande ge anställning till andra personer också.<br/><br/>Intjäningen från egenföretagande är inte fast. Det beror på den inkomst man kan tjäna genom att producera eller köpa och sälja varor eller tillhandahålla tjänster till andra till ett pris.<br/><br/>I egenföretagande måste ägaren ensam ta vinsten och bära risken för förlust. Så vi hittar en direkt koppling mellan ansträngningen och belöningen i egenföretagande.<br/><br/>Det kräver en viss mängd kapitalinvesteringar, även om det kan vara litet.<br/><br/>I egenföretagande är en person fri att fatta beslut om att driva sin verksamhet lönsamt och utnyttja alla möjligheter som kan komma upp för expansion av sin verksamhet. Det ger fullständig frihet att arbeta enligt sin egen vilja och inom de rådande lagarnas parametrar.<br/><br/>Således kan egenföretagande definieras som en ekonomisk verksamhet som man kan utföra på egen hand som ett förvärvsarbete, och detta kan bestå av att producera och sälja varor, köpa och sälja varor eller tillhandahålla tjänster för ett pris. |
