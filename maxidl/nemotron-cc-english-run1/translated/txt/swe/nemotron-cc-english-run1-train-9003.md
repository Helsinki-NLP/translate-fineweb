| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem.

Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here.

Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done.

Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Han tilldelades "Bästa poet 2014 och 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet i en japansk kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>En kort historia av kollaborativ, kollektiv eller kedjepoesi<br/><br/>Collaborativ, kollektiv eller kedjepoesi är en alternativ och kreativ teknik för att skriva poesi av mer än en person. Huvudsyftet med denna typ av poesi är att skapa dikter genom samarbete mellan olika författare / poeter, som försöker bilda en enhetlig röst samtidigt som de behåller sina individuella röster.<br/><br/>Exempel på samarbete i överflöd i japansk poesi. Även om de exakta konton och register av många sådana händelser är antingen förlorade eller saknas.<br/><br/>Ett av de mest kända exemplen på kollektiv poesiskrivning var diktsamlingen med titeln Ralentir Travaux av de surrealistiska franska poeterna André Breton, Paul Éluard och René Char. Dessa tre poeter samarbetade för att skriva dikterna i denna samling under bara fem dagar 1930.<br/><br/>Under 1940-talet uppfann Charles Henri Ford, en amerikansk poet, vad han kallade "kedjedikten", där varje poet skrev en rad och sedan skickade dikten till en annan person (för att fortsätta) i en annan del av världen, via post.<br/><br/>År 2007 redigerades och publicerades en samling amerikanska samarbetspoesi Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry av Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton och David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing har använts i skolor och högskolor för att lära eleverna lagarbete och för att upptäcka sätt på vilka de är anslutna.<br/><br/>Studie av en figur utomhus: Kvinna med en parasoll, vänd till vänster, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain eller Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Syftet med denna artikel och hur man närmar sig utmaningen<br/><br/>För några år sedan skrev jag en artikel som heter "Poem Without an End" som inkluderade en juldikt jag hade skrivit som lånade sig till att läggas till. Jag blev förvånad över svaret eftersom jag i det skedet bara hade några få följare här. Folk skrev en strof av poesi var i "kommentarer" på navet för att följa upp från den tidigare kommentatorns strof. Det fungerade mycket bra och i slutet sammanställde jag alla bidrag till en enda dikt som en del av navet.<br/><br/>Liknande utmaningar har utfärdats sedan dess, inklusive en av Frank Atanacio kallad "Spirits Sat as Mourners" som också var mycket framgångsrik. Skillnaden är att i det fallet skrev bidragsgivare sina egna nav för sin poesi och placerade en länk på Franks ursprungliga nav.<br/><br/>För den här utmaningen förväntar jag mig inte att alla ska spendera värdefull tid på att skriva separata nav för en strof av poesi (om du inte verkligen vill). Det största problemet är att för att göra det effektivt skulle du behöva kopiera de tidigare skrivna delarna av dikten på ditt nav och skulle förmodligen träffas med "duplication" -etikett.<br/><br/>Så, eftersom det är fallet, och även för att spara att behöva lämna länkar överallt, ber jag bara att alla som vill delta bara skriva sin stanza här i "kommentarer". Kontrollera den sista kommentaren före din som bidrar till utmaningen och följ upp. Om jag ser mer än en följande från samma stanza kommer jag att använda min poetiska licens för att arbeta dem som jag anser bäst.<br/><br/>Vid något tillfälle när jag känner att det har lagts till tillräckligt med strofer kommer jag förmodligen att ringa ett slut på utmaningen och sedan sammanställa dem alla tillsammans som den färdiga dikten som en del av artikeln (även ge kredit till varje bidragsgivare).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Utmaningen!<br/><br/>Nu kommer den intressanta delen. Om man ansluter sig till denna kedjepoesiutmaning måste man försöka hålla diktens stil och röst så nära som möjligt de föregående verserna, så att det för oinformerade läsare framstår som att endast en författare skrivit hela dikten.<br/><br/>Låter lätt, säger du? Tja kanske det skulle vara om dikten hade en traditionell stil, rim eller meter. Men den här inte! Dikten du kommer att lägga till startades av en bekant till mig Andriealphus som en "kedjedikt utmaning" på annat håll. I skrivande stund var jag den enda andra personen som hade accepterat utmaningen, och eftersom jag älskade ämnet tyckte jag att det skulle vara en stor utmaning för mina medförfattare och bestämde mig för att använda den här och se om svaret skulle vara bättre. (Jag känner till några poeter här vars skrivande skulle passa denna stil)<br/><br/>Regler:<br/><br/>Följ upp från föregående strof i kommentarerna<br/><br/>Försök att behålla diktens röst och stil<br/><br/>Håll din stanza / vers till ungefär samma längd som de tidigare<br/><br/>Claude Monet var en av de mest kända målarna i konsthistorien och en ledande figur inom den impressionistiska rörelsen.<br/><br/>År 1883 flyttade Monet till Giverny. Här älskade han att måla utomhus i trädgårdarna som han hjälpte till att skapa. De näckrosor som fanns i dammen hade en särskild dragningskraft, och han målade flera serier av dem under resten av sitt liv; bron i japansk stil över dammen blev också föremål för flera verk.<br/><br/>1912 målade Monet en serie av 12 vattenliljemålningar på uppdrag av Orangerie des Tuileries, ett museum i Paris. Han valde att göra dem i mycket stor skala, och att fungera som en "hamn av fredlig meditation." Detta projekt förbrukade mycket av Monets senare år. Monet sa en gång: "Dessa landskap av vatten och reflektion har blivit en besatthet för mig. Det är bortom min styrka som en gammal man, och ändå vill jag göra vad jag känner."<br/><br/>Hans hälsa var nu också ett hinder. Nästan blind, med båda ögonen allvarligt drabbade av grå starr, gick Monet slutligen med på att genomgå operation för sjukdomen 1923.<br/><br/>Monets berömda näckrosor blev rödare när hans grå starr fortskred. Efter att ha fått korrigerande kirurgi förstörde han de flesta av de "röda liljorna" målningar, arg att ingen verkligen nämnde det för honom. Ironiskt nog var dessa målningar förmodligen det som gjorde hans impressionistiska stil så känd på den tiden - konstnärer började ta mer risker med färg och sådant under denna punkt. (källa: biografi.com)<br/><br/>Mästerverket<br/><br/>Pojken som sitter bakom dig säger att du ser ut som ett mästerverk.<br/><br/>Fråga honom, har han någonsin sett en Monet på nära håll?<br/><br/>Nära nog att se något annat än förvirrade slag av weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Nära nog att doppa fingrarna i åsarna<br/><br/>där oljefärger härdas under en konstnärs blick?<br/><br/>Tillräckligt nära för att andas på blodliljorna?<br/><br/>Fråga honom, varför målade han dem röda?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Han skrattade som Carrolls cheshirekatt.<br/><br/>"Genom molniga och blodsprängda ögon föreställer jag mig.<br/><br/>Var mina vattenliljor!" säger han.<br/><br/>"Känn min andedräkt och låt mina fingrar gräva,<br/><br/>Bli mitt mästerverk istället.<br/><br/>En borste har aldrig rört en duk så bra som din ljusa hud.<br/><br/>Låt herrarna gråta i svartsjuka,<br/><br/>och van Gogh skär sitt öra i avund på skönheten i din nakenhet.

Jag har gjort mitt bästa för att ordna dem som jag tycker är bäst med bara en liten redigering. Jag kommer förmodligen att posta den färdiga dikten som en separat nav med en länk på den här till den. Min bok finns på Lulu och iBooks ... det finns en länk på en av de tidigare kommentarerna. Jag skulle verkligen uppskatta det om du skulle köpa en kopia. Tänk på att det är min första eBook så formatering etc är inte perfekt, men det har tagit mig sju revideringar jag tror att få det där det är. Det blir allt lättare nästa gång. Om du behöver hjälp låt mig veta.<br/><br/>Travmaj från Australien den 12 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Hej John, du har verkligen haft några utmärkta svar på din utmaning - jag är säker på att du kommer att smälta det helt vackert även om jag föreställer mig en svår uppgift. Jag är intresserad av dina poesiböcker också - jag måste verkligen få min handling tillsammans tekniskt - jag ska försöka kolla upp allt ... hej -<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 11 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Jo, båda böckerna "On the Wings of Eagles" och "I Laughed a Smile" har mestadels samma innehåll ... förutom den förra har en extra dikt. Ursprungligen var de i olika format, en ePub, den andra PDF men nu är de båda ePub. De är tillgängliga via Lulu och iBooks, snart Barnes och Noble och Nook (inte Amazon). Jag kan försöka publicera en annan bok via Amazon snart bara för att se hur det jämför. Tack igen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues från Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 11 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>John, tack så mycket, informationen om publicering med Lulu kommer att vara ganska användbar som jag tänker på publicering men jag är för närvarande sliten mellan Amazon och Lulu. Jag ville köpa en av dina böcker, men jag kunde inte hitta dem på Amazon. Men jag kommer nog att få det från Lulu. Önskar dig all framgång, du förtjänar det.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 11 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Phyllis, tack för att du påminde. Jag gillar det, ett perfekt slut på dikten tycker jag.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 11 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Tack till Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 11 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Jo, jag tror att jag har sorterat ut dikten tillfredsställande. Väntar bara på att se om det finns något mer att lägga till. Publicering med Lulu var inte dåligt och nu när jag har gjort det en gång blir det lättare nästa gång. Att få formateringen att se rätt ut i e-boken var det svåraste, men du och bara skriva in det i ett orddokument och Lulu producerar automatiskt innehållssidan och konverterar dokumentet till ePub eller PDF kan du bara använda vissa teckensnitt och måste se till att kapitelnamnen eller dikttitlarna är i rubrik 1. De ger också ett gratis ISBN-nummer om du vill. Sammantaget var det dock lättare än förväntat.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues från Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 11 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, det här är kortfattat och vackert, jag älskar det. Shyron's gjorde ett utmärkt jobb också, jag trodde att jag redan hade kommenterat hennes vers, men det hade jag inte.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns från High desert i Nevada. den 10 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Underbart nav, bra idé, Jodah.

John, ser fram emot att läsa slutresultatet.<br/><br/>Förresten, congtats på att publicera dina dikter. Hur hittade du processen med att publicera med Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 10 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Nej, det är inte för sent, jag sammanställer fortfarande den sista dikten så det borde vara upp för alla att se om en dag eller två.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper från södra USA den 10 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Hej John,<br/><br/>Jag ber om ursäkt för min sena inlämning här till din underbara utmaning. Jag är borta från jobbet ett par dagar och bestämde mig för att ge detta ett försök medan min man vilar från knäoperation.

Tack till alla som har bidragit.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 2 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Tack Genna. Det verkar Monet är en favorit arist av många här. Jag hoppas att du kommer att delta i denna utmaning också :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 2 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Tack för ett bra bidrag Shyron. Detta är en mycket trevlig vers. Bra gjort.<br/><br/>Genna East från Massachusetts, USA den 2 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Jag har också...<br/><br/>Jag började läsa denna underbara utmaning (Monet är en av mina favoritartister) och kom sedan tillbaka för att läsa några av de vackra bidragen som ger denna målning en fantastisk röst genom perception och sinnena.

Jag är så glad att du gillar mitt bidrag. Det här är en mycket bra idé, jag vet att du kommer att ha kul att sätta ihop allt. Var försiktig och mitt bästa för dig.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Tack Deb, ja jag är imponerad av standarden på inlämningar. Jag ser fram emot att sätta ihop allt.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Ann, det är bra att se poeterna bland oss ta upp utmaningen med några stora bidrag hittills. Jag hoppas bara att jag kan göra det rättvisa när det gäller att sätta ihop det.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Bra gjort Jo. Ordet "sublime" kommer att tänka på. Jag hoppades att alla poeter skulle stiga i förgrunden, och de har. Älska det, tack för att du bidrar.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt från Stillwater, OK den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Jag är glad att se vad du slutar med här. Det finns ett antal fina poeter som stiger till utmaningen, så gå till det!<br/><br/>Ann Carr från SW England den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Jättebra, Jo!<br/><br/>Du har fått alla att gå, John! snarare du än jag, att sätta ihop allt detta, men det kommer att bli en humdinger av en dikt när det äntligen kommer till ett slut - om det någonsin gör det! Du har verkligen börjat något.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues från Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Okej, John här går ingenting! Följer från Kims. Jag hoppas det läser bra.<br/><br/>Och pojken började gå sin väg<br/><br/>Men i hans kölvatten hörde jag honom säga<br/><br/>"Jag tog en resa till Orangerie<br/><br/>Där Monets spöke fortfarande finns kvar<br/><br/>Jag satte mig ner och stirrade en stund<br/><br/>Tills jag hörde en mjuk röst gråta.<br/><br/>Har du någonsin sett en flytande dröm?<br/><br/>Där ljuset utvecklas till vad det berör<br/><br/>Där lugnet flödar genom molnig slöja<br/><br/>Där trollkarlens pensel som blixten rusar<br/><br/>Har du någonsin sett en fantastisk syn?<br/><br/>Ett barn fött ur en förvrängd illusion<br/><br/>Denna blommande damm som fångar ljuset<br/><br/>som lyfter hjärtat och lockar själen<br/><br/>En abstrakt pulchritude på nära håll<br/><br/>Flytta tillbaka, se; sådan lugn glädje. "<br/><br/>Jag hoppas att detta är i linje med vad de andra har gjort. Känn dig fri att redigera om det behövs. Mitt bästa...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues från Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Okej!<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>Vem som helst är välkommen att göra mer än en stanza. Jag kan lägga till en annan själv vid något tillfälle.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues från Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 1 augusti 2015:<br/><br/>John, jag har bestämt mig för att prova, men det handlar om 16 rader, kan jag göra det i två strofer efter Kims underbara inlämning? Du kan alltid redigera det senare.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 31 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hej Jo, ledsen att höra att du är under vädret just nu. Jag har inte bråttom att stänga denna utmaning så jag håller den öppen tills du är tillbaka och skjuter på alla cylindrar och kan bidra. Du är en av de hubbers jag såg fram emot att få ett svar från som jag trodde att det skulle passa. Tack för dina vänliga ord, och bli bra snart.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues från Lincolnshire, Storbritannien den 31 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Jag kan inte tro att jag nästan missade din otroliga utmaning. Detta är något som jag skulle ha älskat att delta i eftersom Claude Monet är en av mina favoritartister. Tyvärr måste jag gråta. Jag är lite under vädret med ett huvud fullt av bomullsull, eller så verkar det. Om utmaningen fortfarande är öppen när jag blir av med denna irriterande influensa kan jag ge det en chans, men jag måste säga att standarden är exceptionellt hög. Maj tog det till en annan nivå men alla bidrag är lysande. Kudos till dig Andriealphus och de andra författarna som deltog hittills i detta konstnärliga och kreativa mästerverk.<br/><br/>Mitt bästa är alltid Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 31 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hej igen Maj, glad att denna dikt inspirerade dig, och ja det slår att titta på cricket särskilt med Aussie batsmen som presterar dåligt i detta tredje test. Det blir en intressant övning för mig att smälta alla strofer tillsammans men borde vara bra.<br/><br/>Travmaj från Australien den 30 juli 2015:<br/><br/>John, tack, jag är mest glad att du gillar mitt erbjudande. Jag fann dikten spännande och kände mig plötsligt inspirerad att skriva min version i samma läge. Jag är inte säker på att jag skrev en fortsättning från stanza innan (alltid utforskar) men jag är säker på att du kommer att smälta det helt och hållet när tiden kommer. Jag har inte lyckats med något kreativt skrivande för yonks, kan inte vänta nu för att börja om, behöver bara lite tid. (slår att titta på cricket också!!!) Cheers John, kommer att checka in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 30 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Tack för att du kollade Dana. Jag är nöjd med kvaliteten på svaren hittills. Jag måste bara vänta och se hur många fler som kommer in. Slutet, dikten borde vara bra.<br/><br/>Dana Tate från LOS ANGELES den 30 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Jag kollar bara in för att se hur det går, jag kan inte vänta på den färdiga produkten. Jag deltog i en poesiklass och vi gjorde det också det var väldigt roligt.<br/><br/>ocfireflies från North Carolina den 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Tack så mycket för att tillhandahålla plattformen för utan att det är lätt att falla ner.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Jag har inte sett dig på ett tag, hoppas allt är bra.<br/><br/>John Hansen (författare) från Gondwana Land den 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Vackert arbete Kim. Det kommer att följa perfekt från Majs som du svarade på GIverny-frågan. Jag är så nöjd med kvaliteten på svaren hittills.<br/><br/>ocfireflies från North Carolina den 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Jag hade skickat detta tidigare innan travmaj's awesome bidrag, men kanske det fortfarande fungerar (jag gjorde lite tweaking)<br/><br/>I motsats till tidigare vet jag inte om<br/><br/>Jag gör någon mening. Om det inte fungerar, är du välkommen att ta bort och jag kommer att försöka igen. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Först och främst måste EEQT själv vidareutvecklas för att ge ett teoretiskt och beräkningsmässigt svar på behoven hos modern kvantteknik och teknik. Vi måste inkludera klassiska system med oändligt antal frihetsgrader - som elektromagnetiska och / eller gravitationsfält. Vi måste också inkludera oändliga kvantsystem för att förstå och simulera Bose-gas och dess fasövergångar. Men det finns också steg som måste tas långt bortom EEQT: s paradigm.<br/>Som vi har betonat så många gånger: kvantteori har ännu inte förstås i termer av en "icke-linjär klassisk teori." Men vad vi menar med en "klassisk teori" är något mycket mer avancerat och mer allmänt än klasisk mekanik eller klassisk fältteori. Med en "klassisk teori" menar vi först och främst en teori som inte är baserad på sannolikheter från början; en teori där sannolikheter uppträder i ett senare skede, härlett från teorin; härlett kanske på ett nödvändigt sätt. En sådan teori måste inte bara specificera de matematiska objekten och deras relationer utan också göra "förutsägelser".<br/>En klassisk teori är i synnerhet en teori där diskreta händelser kan inträffa, händelser som är "objektiva". De kan vara händelser som huvudsakligen påverkar det fysiska skiktet, men de kan också vara ”mentala händelser”, förändringar av tillstånd av ”medvetande”; oavsett vad de är, även om de rör sig om förgreningar av universer – så händer de.<br/>En sådan teori, som omfattar kvantteorin som vi känner den idag, existerar ännu inte, men vi kan föreställa oss dess möjliga form. Ingenting tjänar bättre än ett exempel, så låt oss här ge ett exempel på hur en sådan teori kan tolkas.<br/>Föreställ dig en teori utvecklad a'la Einsteins enhetliga fältteori, men med variabel metrisk signatur, möjligen med en komplex kausal webb, multipla<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (se även [41]) broar, tidsloopar, icke-differentierbarhet, fraktal struktur, allt detta kompliceras dessutom av variabel dimensionalitet av rum och av "tid" (jfr [42]. Föreställ dig en sådan teori för att kunna rymma alla de fyra grundläggande krafterna som är kända för oss, men det innebär också ett extra fält, som skiljer sig från fysiska fält, och som är icke-lokalt i den meningen att det inte överlever att ta en makromedelvärdesgräns när kausalrumtidsstrukturen i Einsteins allmänna relativitetsteori återvinns. Detta extra fält skulle vara en plats för "tankeformer" och vår teori skulle koppla dessa tankeformer till mer "fysiska" nivåer av verkligheten.<br/>"tid" skulle uppstå endast i en viss begränsande struktur. Ingenting hindrar en teori av en sådan typ att ha matematiska strukturer rika nog att rymma medvetande och sinne. På grund av dess komplexitet, täthet av tidsslingor, bubbla-liknande kausal struktur, gör förutsägelser i en sådan teori är möjlig endast genom att tillämpa sannolikhet -<br/>som det är fallet med system som utvecklas enligt deterministisk men kaotisk dynamik. Kvantvågsfunktion skulle framträda i en sådan teori som ett effektivt sätt att förutsäga. Den typen av förklaring av quantum indeterminism postulerades för länge sedan av IJ Good. I<br/>[3] Han spekulerade i att kvantindeterminism kan förstås om vi medger att enskilda kvanthändelser som faktiskt inträffar här och nu har framtida avancerade orsaker också har tidigare efterblivna orsaker.<br/>En glimt av en sådan tanke kan ha inträffat för Alan Turing när han skrev sin berömda, redan citerade mening: "förutsägelse måste vara linjär, beskrivning måste vara icke-linjär."<br/>En teori som delvis går i denna riktning utvecklas av L. Nottale<br/>[43] som konstaterar observationen, tillskriven Feynman, att "de typiska vägarna för kvantmekaniska partiklar är kontinuerliga icke-differentierbara." Därefter fortsätter han sin utveckling av fraktala rumtidsidéer till slut med: "Kvantbeteendet blir i denna teori en manifestation av rumtidens fraktala geometri, på samma sätt är gravitationen, i Einsteins teori om allmän (rörelse-)relativitet, en manifestation av rumtidens krökning.<br/>Ett annat steg i denna riktning kommer från ryska forskares arbete - som började med de mest originella idéerna från N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>och A. Sacharov [ 45 ], och håller på att utvecklas i Moskva, Uralerna och Sibirien, se t. ex. [ 46, 47, 48 ]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Bästa Nutrition och motion för att gå ner i vikt<br/><br/>Hur är frukosten egentligen hälsosam?<br/><br/>På morgonen som en kejsare, vid middagstid som en kung, på kvällen som en tiggare – går ett välkänt ordspråk. En studie av den medicinska organisationen Endocrine Society bekräftar nyckelbudskapet bakom talesättet: Det visar att frukost spelar en viktigare roll än vad som ofta antas. På morgonen har människokroppen faktiskt mer än dubbelt så hög metabolisk aktivitet som vid andra tider på dagen: En stor frukost håller dig inte bara full under lång tid, blodsocker och insulinnivåer stiger också långsamt. Aptit för godis är reglerad, vi äter snacks mindre ofta under dagen. Därför bör frukost inte hoppas över även under en diet.<br/><br/>Att ha en stor frukost betyder naturligtvis inte att vi ska ha flera croissanter med nut nougatkräm och söta frukostpannkakor på morgonen. Frukost är hälsosamt bäst när det är högt i protein och fiber, samt att ge vitaminer och mineraler. Fullkornsbröd eller muesli, havreflingor, frukt och nötter är energileverantörer som är bra för dig och håller dig full under lång tid.<br/><br/>Det faktum att en stor frukost är bättre än en stor middag betyder inte nödvändigtvis att frukost är avgörande för att gå ner i vikt. En metaanalys som genomfördes 2019 visade att det totala dagliga energiintaget för personer som äter frukost är i genomsnitt högre än för dem som inte äter frukost. De senare var i genomsnitt knappt en halv kilo lättare. Så, enligt resultaten av denna stora studie, behöver du inte nödvändigtvis äta frukost om du vill gå ner i vikt.<br/><br/>Gå ner i vikt med rätt kost - det är hur lätt det är att sätta hälsosamt på din tallrik<br/><br/>Att äta hälsosamt betyder inte på något sätt mindre smak. Färska grönsaker, fisk eller kött som proteinkällor och andra hälsosamma ingredienser frammanar smak i grytan och ett leende på läpparna – helst även när du kliver på vågen. En amerikansk studie har visat att människor som lagar sin egen mat och medvetet hanterar vad de äter har ett kroppsmassindex i det normala intervallet. Restaurangbesök eller snabbmat lockar däremot snabbt in dig i sockerfällan: Ofta finns det ingen indikation på hur mycket socker som finns i salladsdressingar, hur mycket fett potatisen stektes i eller om köttet inte behandlades.<br/><br/>En hälsosam lunch består av tre delar – den största delen är frukt eller grönsaker och bör täcka hälften av tallriken. En fjärdedel av måltiden bör bestå av protein, dvs fisk, kött eller tofu. Det återstående kvartalet består av kolhydrater och är idealiskt gjord av fullkornsprodukter. Viktigt: Ät inte vid skrivbordet på kontoret, men stimulera din ämnesomsättning och helst ta en kort promenad före eller efter lunch.<br/><br/>När ska du äta för att gå ner i vikt?<br/><br/>På kvällen bör du fokusera på lätta måltider som är ganska låga i kolhydrater. Dessa är minst benägna att orsaka insulin till skyrocket, vilket är bra för vår kropp. Grönsaker, mejeriprodukter och nötter, till exempel, är väl lämpade för detta.<br/><br/>Du bör också vara försiktig så att du inte äter middag för sent. Det är bäst att ha ätit fram till 19:00 - då kan kroppen slappna av och förbereda sig för natten. Tillräcklig sömn är viktig för hälsosam viktminskning. En amerikansk studie fann att människor som sov ungefär åtta timmar per natt hade bättre fettdepåer. Så god natt! Tillåt dig mer än sex timmars sömn så att du kan börja nästa dag passform och uppdateras.<br/><br/>Att gå ner i vikt utan träning – är det verkligen möjligt?<br/><br/>Det skulle vara så lätt, om drömvikten kunde uppnås helt enkelt genom att sänka kaloriintaget. Men du vet förmodligen visdomen att kost bara är en sida av myntet och motion är den andra. Så ingenting hjälper: Sätt på dig dina sportkläder och gå!<br/><br/>Den som, förutom sportprogrammet som jogging, promenader eller simning, också låter hissen gå ensam och tar trappan, tar en liten omväg eller använder cykeln istället för bilen, gör välis kallas också något bra. Även enkel promenad är bra för hälsan. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Varför vi öppnade Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Varför open source?<br/><br/>För ett tag sedan öppnade vi Anvil App Server. Samhällsreaktionen har varit stor, till och med lite överväldigande (ja, varje svar på det tillkännagivandet landade verkligen i min inkorg!). Vi har redan införlivat en massa av den feedbacken i vår version 1.2-utgåva. Men vi fortsätter att få frågan, "Varför öppnade du en sådan kärndel av din produkt?"<br/><br/>Varför göra detta alls?<br/><br/>Anvil är ett verktyg som gör det så enkelt som möjligt att bygga en webbapp. Vi gör det genom att du kan bygga hela applikationen på ett språk, Python.<br/><br/>Enkel hosting är en del av detta.<br/><br/>Webbplattformen är trasig, och Anvil är vårt försök att fixa det. Och eftersom det finns så mycket komplexitet i att distribuera en webbapp var en molnbaserad tjänst det bästa sättet att ge den enkelhet vi vill ha. På så sätt kan du bygga din app i Anvil Editor och göra det live på Internet med ett klick.<br/><br/>Men vi hörde från folk som sa: "Det är bra, men..."<br/><br/>"... men jag måste köra detta på en offshore-plattform utan tillförlitlig tillgång till internet"<br/><br/>"...men jag vill paketera min app i en IoT-enhet jag säljer"<br/><br/>Eller helt enkelt, "... men om jag lägger mina ägg i den här korgen, hur kan jag vara säker på att jag fortfarande kan köra min app om tio år?"<br/><br/>Det här är alla bra punkter! En molntjänst är inte rätt lösning för alla. Om vi vill tjäna dessa användare måste det finnas något sätt för dem att få sina appar ur Anvil och köra dem lokalt, under egen fullständig kontroll.<br/><br/>Öppen källkod: Escape lucka, inte en ejektor säte<br/><br/>Vi tror på flyktluckor, inte ejektorsäten. Vid konferenser får vi ibland frågan "kan jag exportera detta som en Flask+JS-app?". Visst, det skulle vara möjligt - vi kunde generera ett serverpaket, kompilera klientsidan Python till Javascript och spotta ut en klassisk webbapp. Men det skulle ha allvarliga nackdelar, eftersom:<br/><br/>Inte en bekväm åktur.<br/><br/>Kodgenerering är en ejektorplats. Genererad kod är bättre än ingenting - åtminstone kan du redigera den! Men det ögonblick du redigerar den koden förlorar du alla fördelar med systemet som genererade den. Om du använder Anvil på grund av dess dra-och-släpp-redigerare och Python i webbläsaren, varför ska våra lokalt värderade användare behöva använda vim och Javascript?<br/><br/>Så vi gjorde det på rätt sätt: vi open sourcede Anvils runtime-motor. Det är samma kod som tjänar din app i vår värdtjänst, och den representerar din app på samma sätt. Du kan redigera din kod med en textredigerare, köra den och sedan trycka tillbaka den i vår online-IDE. Det är inte en ejektorplats: det finns ingen explosiv övergång. Det är en flyktlucka: du kan klättra ut och klättra rätt tillbaka in.<br/><br/>Hur är det med vår affärsmodell?<br/><br/>Anvil var aldrig tänkt att vara en av de företag lågkodssystem som debiterar dig $ 20 / mo för varje person som använder din app. Anvil är ett utvecklarverktyg. De appar du utvecklar är dina. Att göra det möjligt för dig att köra dem på en Raspberry Pi är coolt, men det förändrar inte vår affärsmodell.<br/><br/>Vi gör vad vi alltid har gjort: Vi tillverkar och säljer ett utvecklingsverktyg som gör det drastiskt enklare att bygga webbapplikationer. Vi tillhandahåller hosting för Anvil-appar. Vi erbjuder hela utvecklings- och värdplattformen på plats för företagskunder. Och naturligtvis erbjuder vi en gratis plan så att alla kan använda Anvil för hobby eller utbildningsändamål - eller för att börja bygga något och se hur det går.<br/><br/>Vi har öppnat Anvil App Server för (relativt litet) antal människor som behöver det, och för att ge den ultimata försäkringen. Visst, du kan bygga en app med vim och vara värd själv, utan att ens registrera ett konto hos oss (vi har docs att visa dig hur!). Men Anvil Editor är världens enklaste sätt att bygga en webbapp, och vår värdtjänst är det enklaste sättet att distribuera det - så det är vad vi förväntar oss att de flesta av våra användare ska fortsätta göra. Och du kan bygga med tillförsikt och veta att öppen källkod finns där om du behöver det.<br/><br/>Prova själv<br/><br/>Om vår utvecklingsfilosofi resonerar med dig, varför inte prova Anvil själv? |
