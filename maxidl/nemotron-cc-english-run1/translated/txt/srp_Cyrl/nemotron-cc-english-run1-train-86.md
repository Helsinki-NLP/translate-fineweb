| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N.

Новине и часописи широм Сједињених Држава и Европе извештавали су о Леклеровом експерименту, посебно током првих 20 година његовог постојања. Године 1979, због своје јединствене историје, некадашње село је уписано у Национални регистар историјских места.<br/><br/>Лецлаире је основао Нелсон Оливер Нелсон, произвођач водовода у Сент Луису који је дуги низ година настојао да унапреди тешкоће радничке класе. Нелсон је желео да побољша услове рада за своје запослене и обезбеди становање у близини фабрика како би радници и њихове породице могли лако да учествују у рекреативним и образовним програмима које компанија нуди бесплатно. Пре 1890. године, док је још био у Сент Луису, производни и дистрибутивни бизнис компаније Н.О. Нелсон почео је да пружа подјелу профита заједно са образовним и рекреативним могућностима. Лецлаире кооперативни експеримент би донео додатне користи.<br/><br/>Када су Нелсонови запослени навели да желе да се преселе на руралну локацију, представници компаније су се обратили лидерима малих градова у неколико заједница у Мисурију и Илиноису у близини њиховог седишта у Сент Луису. Тражили су погодну имовину за изградњу нових фабрика и модел села. Јужно од Едвардсвиллеа пронашли су 125 хектара земљишта са приступом води, угљу и транспорту. Локални бизнисмени су брзо деловали како би понудили финансијски подстицај. За мање од три недеље, заједница је прикупила фонд од 20.000 долара од појединачних доприноса између 1 и 1.000 долара како би привукла Нелсона да изабере Едвардсвилле за свој подухват.<br/><br/>Градски лидери су се надали да ће лоцирати имовину унутар градских граница Едвардсвиллеа, али када није било погодне локације, били су увјерени да ће Нелсонова инвестиција јужно од града ускоро постати дио Едвардсвиллеа. Иако је Нелсон испунио све услове за изградњу и стварање радних места у свом уговору, било би 44 године пре анексије Едвардсвила. Леклер, омеђен Медисон/Браун авенијама на истоку, железничким пругама на западу, Хадли/МекКинли авенијама на југу и Волф улицом на северу, остао је независно село од 1890. до 1934. године. Током тог времена стекао је репутацију за иновације у пословању, образовању и стамбеном планирању.<br/><br/>Село Леклер на мапи Едвардсвила из 1931. године<br/>Љубазношћу Пола Џенкинса<br/><br/>Нелсонова одлука да изгради село није донета из хира. До краја 1880-их био је међународни лидер у области сарадње и поделе профита, размењујући друштвене теорије са другима широм света док је проширио свој посао у Сент Луису. Своје експериментално село назвао је по паришком профитеру Едме Жан Лецлаире, али је посјетио многе друге друштвене визионаре који су пружили информације и инспирацију. Састављајући најбоље идеје из ових примера, Нелсон је основао Лецлаира да, по његовим речима, "даје посао, промовише интелигенцију, пружа рекреацију, негује лепоту и прави домове." То су сви фактори које је утврдио неопходним за мушкарце да воде испуњавајуће животе. Каснији писци су користили ове речи да формулишу Леклерове оснивачке принципе: рад, домови, образовање, рекреација и лепота, али са додатним важним принципом слободе.<br/><br/>Посао<br/><br/>Рад се може сматрати најважнијим од ових фактора, јер без фабричких послова у Лецлаиреу, не би било села. Зграде фабрике цигле дизајнирао је архитекта Е. А. Камерон како би обезбедио природно светло, вентилацију у лето и грејане подове зими. Постојао је систем за гашење пожара и, иако индустријске несреће нису елиминисане, уложени су сви напори да се гарантује безбедност радника. Зграде од опеке покривене бршљаном биле су окружене добро уређеним травњацима и цветним вртовима који комплексу дају изглед кампуса. 1894. године Њујоршки светски репортер Неллие Бли назвао је зграде "идеалним савршенством зграда за човека да ради у".<br/><br/>Производни комплекс Н. О. Нелсон Мануфацтуринг Цомпани у Лецлаире<br/>Пријатељи Леклер<br/><br/>Нелсон политике компаније су дизајнирани да заштите финансијску стабилност запослених. Радници могу зарадити део профита и имају глас у компанији ако су изабрали ту опцију. План за подјелу профита дао је запосленима Нелсона понос власништва који је резултирао подршком радној снази. Током година било је неколико краткотрајних радних штрајкова, али већином су проблеми са радом били ријетки. Радници су такође имали разумне сате и конкурентне плате. Постојао је провидентни фонд који је обезбеђивао пензије и боловање, као и пензије удовица ако је радник умро, без обзира да ли је смрт повезана са његовим запослењем.<br/><br/>Седиште компаније за Н. О. Нелсон Цомпани (НОНЦО) остао у Сент Луису, али све Н. О. Нелсон Мануфацтуринг Цомпани је пресељен у Лецлаире. Производна компанија је подељена на продавнице које су направиле различите производе. Године 1900, продавнице су постале независне компаније за пореске сврхе, али су све и даље биле у власништву Н. О. Нелсон Мануфацтуринг Цомпани. Продавнице су укључивале Кабинет Милл где су производи од дрвета од кабинета до млинице. Квалификовани занатлије који су овде радили такође су испунили посебне уговоре, укључујући кавезе за благајнике за локалну банку и олтар који се и даље користи у Епископској цркви Светог Андреја у Едвардсвилу. Мраморна продавница специјализована је за архитектонски мермер који су Нелсонове посаде изрезале и инсталирале у домовима, предузећима, па чак и државним капитолима широм Средњег запада. Машинска продавница, која је постала Бигналл и Кеелер, направила је машине за уградњу цеви, пумпе, мерила и разне механичке алате који се очекују у индустрији водовода. Такође су се разгранали за производњу специјалних предмета као што је Лецлаире Бицикл средином 1890-их. Брасс Схоп је укључивао ливницу у којој су се производиле разне водоводне цеви и алати. Ови примери представљају само неке од радова обављених у фабрикама Лецлаире. Логотип компаније био је стилизовани "НОНЦО" који се и данас може видети на водоводним уређајима и неким ватрогасним хидрантима у Едвардсвилу.<br/><br/>Куће<br/><br/>Пре него што су се куће могле изградити, било је потребно становање за раднике који су довршавали фабричке зграде, као и изградњу кућа. Да би се задовољиле те потребе, компанија је изградила "Клубску кућу", велику зграду која је служила многим сврхама. Поред смештаја, то је била прва образовна зграда у заједници, и садржала је добро залиха библиотеке.<br/><br/>Изградња стамбеног дела Леклера почела је одмах након што је село основано у јуну 1890. године. Јулиус Питзман, иновативни пејзажни архитекта који је поставио прве парцеле у Лецлаиреу, поставио их је са бројним заштитним заветима. Завети су предвиђали широке, криволинеарне улице, велике парцеле и ограничење дела које је ограничавало имовину само у стамбене или образовне сврхе. Компанија је поплочала улице, обезбедила електрична улична светла, инсталирала тротоаре и посадила стотине дрвећа дуж улица Лецлаиреа. Каснији делови Леклера су постављени са конвенционалним дизајном мреже и мањим серијама, али су и даље укључивали ограничења дела.<br/><br/>Викторијанска викендица Лецлаире 1907. године<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>У почетку су куће изграђене од стране компаније, а затим су продате по скорој цени запосленима Нелсона како би подстакле власништво над кућом. Ако се радник разболео и није могао направити хипотеку, плаћања су суспендована све док се није вратио на посао. Куће су понуђене у различитим дизајнима кућа, а компанија је рекламирала да нема два стана. Најраније куће су првенствено викторијанске викендице које су долазиле са струјом и текућом водом. Затим су уследили бунгалови, четири квадрата, па чак и неки домови. Становници су могли да купе кућу изграђену од стране компаније или купе празну парцелу и сами изграде кућу, под условом да архитектонски дизајн испуни стандарде компаније.<br/><br/>У каснијим годинама, парцеле су продате инвеститорима, обично становницима Едвардсвиллеа, а многе куће 1920-их су изградили локални извођачи који су их затим продали становницима подручја.<br/><br/>Образовање<br/><br/>Нелсон је веровао у образовање за све, укључујући и радничку класу. Образовно програмирање почело је са вртићем у Клубској кући 1892. године и наставило се у новој образовној згради на 722 Холиоаке Роад. Обично се зове "Школска кућа", ова зграда је обезбедила велику дворану за састанке и програме, али је имала покретне преграде да би је поделила у учионицу током дана. У вечерњим сатима, било је плесова, састанака или програма Лецлаире Селф-Цултуре Цлуб који је садржао недељна предавања професора Универзитета у Вашингтону или национално познатих говорника који су, као Н. О. Нелсон, били део покрета друштвеног побољшања на прелазу века. Међу њима су били Џејн Адамс, Едвард Еверет Хејл, Семјуел "Златно правило" Џонс и аутор Шарлот Перкинс Гилман, између осталих.<br/><br/>Деца уписана у вртић Лецлаире 1913. године<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>У десет година након изградње образовне зграде 1895. године, постојала је серија образовних експеримената, укључујући индустријску школу, колеџ, ноћну школу и академију. Најранији и најдужи подухват био је јутарњи вртић, основан 1892. године, који је користио Фробелов модел. Овај двогодишњи програм је био бесплатан за све, укључујући децу Едвардсвилле, све до 1931. године када је из финансијских разлога компанија почела да наплаћује школарину студентима који нису били деца запослених. Нелсон Мануфацтуринг је водио вртић до 1934. године када је зграда предата школском округу Едвардсвилле за номиналну накнаду.<br/><br/>Рекреација<br/><br/>Боатерс на језеру Лецлаире 1915. године<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Рекреација је била важна карактеристика Лецлаире. Компанија је обезбедила спортске објекте за бејзбол, тенис, а касније и фудбал. Изграђена је куглана и билијарска сала, а зими је било језеро за пловидбу, пливање, риболов или клизање. Парк Леклер је био опремљен бродовима, мушким и женским купатилима и великим павиљоном. Становници су организовали плесове, хајриде, правописне пчеле и друге активности, а компанија је спонзорисала бенд који је редовно свирао на забавама у селу или у Едвардсвилу. Као и образовне функције у Цлуб Хоусе и Сцхоол Хоусе, рекреативни објекти у Лецлаире-у били су отворени за све и често су били дестинација за посетиоце Едвардсвиллеа, па чак и Сент Луиса.<br/><br/>Беаути<br/><br/>Рана фотографија језера Лецлаире<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Последњи од фактора које је Нелсон сматрао важним за задовољавајући живот односио се на животну средину. Нелсон је знао о важности здравог живота. Ценио је лепоту и чистоћу која се може наћи у земљи, и охрабрио све у Лецлаиреу да улепшају своју имовину садњом вртова и воћњака. Сам Нелсон је водио пример, тако да је стакленик компаније обезбедио бесплатно цвеће и такмичења су одржана за најлепше дворишта. Лецлаире је постављен тако да је цело село имало парк-као подешавање и данас евидентно.<br/><br/>Слобода<br/><br/>Кооперативна продавница Лецлаире<br/>Синди Рајнхард<br/><br/>Нелсон је навео пет оснивачких принципа за Лецлаире, али модерни писци додају шести: Слобода. Сви програми које је компанија понудила били су доступни запосленима, као и локалним становницима, али ниједан није био обавезан. Слобода избора да ли ће учествовати у програмима компаније у потпуности зависи од појединца. Становници Лецлаиреа могли су радити за Нелсон Мануфацтуринг или другде, а радници нису били обавезни да живе у Лецлаиреу. Учешће у рекреативним и образовним програмима такође је било опционо. Постојала је и продавница компаније у којој су запослени могли да купују, али за разлику од других градова компаније, нико није био у дугу према продавници компаније. Продавница Лецлаире била је задруга у којој су члановима наплаћиване фер тржишне цијене, али су затим исплаћиване кварталне дивиденде.<br/><br/>Другачији град компаније<br/><br/>Све ове погодности учиниле су Лецлаире јединственим из других градова компаније. Али било је и појединачних случајева у којима је компанија показала саосећање и бригу за запослене. Компанија је затворила фабрике и унајмила екскурзионе возове да одведу раднике и њихове породице у Сент Луис на дан на Светском сајму у Сент Луису 1904. године. Када је новац био чврст, Нелсон би повремено ставио додатни новац у сваку плаћену коверту како би олакшао живот радницима, а ако је успоставио програм са којим се мушкарци нису слагали, разговарали су о томе и, колико често не, Нелсон би се преокренуо.<br/><br/>Рођен у Лилесанду, Норвешка, 1841. године, Н. О. Нелсон је био компликован човек. Био је капиталиста који је веровао у слободно предузетништво, али и социјалиста, следбеник "Златног правила" и патриота који је служио за Унију у грађанском рату. До 1900. године био је мултимилионер, али до своје смрти 1922. године све је дао ради побољшања радничке класе.<br/><br/>Иако Леклер није био Нелсонов једини друштвени експеримент, сматра се његовим најуспешнијим подухватом. Други велики напори за социјално побољшање укључивали су ланац кооперативних продавница прехрамбених производа у Њу Орлеансу, вртић за децу црних запослених у његовом Бессемеру, Алабама, фабрике и дом за потрошаче у Индију, Калифорнија.<br/><br/>Нелсоново село Леклер је било познато на међународном нивоу као значајан и успешан експеримент. То је описано у Њујорку у више наврата, али посебно репортер Нели Бли 1894. године који је дуго писао о моделном граду гдје је "Радно питање ријешено и сви су срећни у малом селу близу Сент Луиса." Лос Анђелес Тајмс је такође редовно извештавао о Нелсону, као и Чикаго дневник Трибјун и бројне друге публикације.<br/><br/>У говору на Лецлаиреовој прослави 15. годишњице 1915. године, Нелсон је рекао: "Лецлаире вам пружа широко отворено гостопримство и нуди вам да данас уживате у лакоћи и удобности и љепоти и инспирацији коју уживамо сваки дан." Од тог дана прошло је више од једног века, али позив и даље стоји. Становници и истраживачи су позвани да сазнају о Лецлаиреовој историји и размотре лекције које би се могле научити за побољшање будућих генерација.<br/><br/>Једна од некадашњих зграда производног комплекса у 2019. години, која сада служи као Н.О.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Аутор Посете преко Зоом или Скипе<br/><br/>Узбуђен сам што ћу посетити ваше ученике преко Зоома или Скипе-а! Скипе је одлична опција за школе / класе које не доносе ауторе лично, али који желе да истражују књиге и поезију, повежу се са аутором и постављају питања један-на-један.<br/><br/>Трошкови<br/><br/>Нудим 30-45-минутне Зоом или Скипе посете школама за 125 долара по сесији (или 200 долара за две сесије које се одвијају у року од три сата ујутру или поподне; 325 долара за три сесије у једном дану; 425 долара за четири сесије у једном дану). У свакој сесији покушавам да што активније укључим децу. Не, то није иста врста везе као што нуди посета у лицу, али и даље може бити инспиративна и мотивишућа за децу!<br/><br/>Шта радим<br/><br/>Свака сесија за до 50 ученика укључује:<br/><br/>5 минута технолошког подешавања<br/><br/>3 сегмента од 10исх-минута сваки - Изаберите између:<br/><br/>Како сам постао писац<br/><br/>Пишем ову књигу (ви бирате на коју књигу се фокусирам)<br/><br/>Читање (читам неке песме и деца ми помажу да читам друге)<br/><br/>Презентација у учионици (ваши ученици су ставили читање или представу за мене - веома захвалну публику!)<br/><br/>Писање поезије заједно<br/><br/>Сесија питања и одговора<br/><br/>5 минута опуштања / опроштаја<br/><br/>Такође разговарам са класама наставника пре службе или групама наставника у служби о поезији и писању.<br/><br/>Савети за одличну виртуелну посету<br/><br/>Савети за успешну виртуелну посету<br/><br/>Један од мојих циљева за виртуелне школске посете је да ухватим интерактивност која чини лично посете успешним и забавним. Али истина је да је понекад тешко бити виртуелно интерактиван! Тајминг се можда не синхронизује исправно, што чини читање заједно изазовом, и заиста ми је тешко да чујем појединачне студенте осим ако не дођу и говоре директно у микрофон / рачунар. Али након неких покушаја и грешака, открио сам неке начине да имам најбоље могуће виртуелне посјете. Ево их: КСНУМКС начина да моју посјету са својим ученицима учините сјајним искуством!<br/><br/>Пре посете<br/><br/>Узбудите децу што је више могуће о посети. Посетите мој сајт са њима. Прочитајте неке од мојих књига са њима. Сакупите нека питања која студенти имају за мене. Све што урадите унапред како бисте се осећали као БИГ ДЕЛ ће ићи дуг пут ка ангажовању ученика.<br/><br/>Поставите видео камеру или лаптоп са веб камером тако да видим што је више могуће публике. Тешко је проценити ангажман ученика када видим само неколико ученика.<br/><br/>Ограничите сваку групу на 50 ученика. Невероватно је тешко ангажовати велике групе путем видео записа.<br/><br/>Брзо ћу прећи са теме на тему или песму на песму. Молимо вас да подсетите студенте да ће морати да слушају пажљиво да би разумели шта се дешава.<br/><br/>Повремено радим мало Реадер'с Тхеатре са студентима. Ако вам пошаљем било који студентски део који је написан унапред, одштампајте копију за сваку сесију и исеците на комаде, ако је потребно.<br/><br/>Током посете<br/><br/>Када говорим о књизи, ако имате ту штампану књигу, молимо вас да је држите за студенте да виде.<br/><br/>Ти си мој посредник. Често не могу да позовем студенте и чујем појединачне одговоре. Дакле, могао бих да кажем, "Добићемо 3 идеје. Подигните руку ако имате идеју." Онда преузмете, позовете три ученика и објавите те одговоре свима у соби и мени.<br/><br/>Изаберите самоуверене, одлазеће студенте за скриптиране студентске делове (ако пошаљем било који унапред). Током мојих личних посета школи, покушавам да извучем неке од мање самоуверених ученика, али сам открио да то не функционише тако добро током виртуелних посета јер их не чујем.<br/><br/>Нека ученици са деловима који говоре седе испред. Када је време, нека устану и подсете их да говоре гласно.<br/><br/>У виртуелним посетама, управљање понашањем пада искључиво на вас. Често не видим тачно шта се дешава, па вас молимо да уђете по потреби. Ако постоји велики поремећај, само ме замолите да се задржим на тренутак, тако да не ћаскам док нико не обраћа пажњу:>)<br/><br/>Слободно ме сликајте на екрану и делите на друштвеним медијима - иако слике мене често изгледају смешно јер правим смешна лица или нешто док читам!<br/><br/>Ако имате било каквих питања, само питајте, било пре или током посете!<br/><br/>Планирање виртуелне сесије<br/><br/>Да ли сте заинтересовани за заказивање виртуелне посете са мном? Само ми пошаљите е-пошту да поставите датум, а ми ћемо отићи одатле |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Архива вести<br/><br/>Нова књига разматра начине рјешавања изазова ХИВ-а<br/><br/>2011-11-29 Преузимање<br/><br/>Проф. Деннис Францис са Марјорие Хуман који је дизајнирао насловницу књиге, Ацтинг он ХИВ.<br/><br/>Пандемија ХИВ-а је изнела најбоље и најгоре код људи у погледу одговора. С једне стране изазвала је стигму и насиље, а с друге стране довела је до конструктивних и подржавајућих одговора различитих појединаца и група. Нова књига, Дејство на ХИВ, коју је уредио проф. Денис Френсис, декан Факултета за образовање на Универзитету Слободне државе, разматра како се драма може користити за промовисање виталних друштвених промена, као и индивидуалних промена у понашању.<br/><br/>Акција против ХИВ-а нуди систематско истраживање драме као приступ дискутовању о ХИВ / АИДС-у и сродним ставовима и понашањима. Књига је научни текст и укључује рад око двадесетак изузетно креативних аутора. Аутори који доприносе књизи укључују, између осталог, проф. Хазел Барнес (Университи оф тхе Витватерсранд), Роб Паттман (Стелленбосцх Университи) и Ивонне Слиеп са Универзитета КваЗулу-Натал.<br/><br/>"Овај пројекат је започео 2009. године и одузео ми је много времена да окупим рад изузетно креативних аутора. Истраживање које се преноси кроз књигу је оригинално и благовремено и даје значајан допринос разговорима о улози и значају драме у рјешавању питања ХИВ-а и АИДС-а ", каже проф. |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Транскрипт тестирања ефекта духовних замки на плавог краба, Цаллинецтис Сапидус , у заливу Барнегат<br/><br/>Мицхаел ФранклинМарине Фиелд Метходс16 септембар 2008<br/><br/>Одлучио сам да користим Плави рак, Цаллинецтус сапидус, за мој експеримент јер је овде у заливу Барнегат у изобиљу и релативно је лако ухватити.<br/><br/>Цаллинецтес сапидус је рак за пливање Важан за комерцијалне ракове са меким шкољкама, и комерцијалне и рекреативне (Јивофф 2008)Главна метода раковања је основна замка за ракове<br/><br/>Гхост замке се јављају када је замка изгубљена, али наставља да хвата организме (Бреен 1990) Џон Внек каже да их је лако 2.000 у Барнегат БаиПошто је Ц. сапидус тако агресиван (Поллоцк 1998) , шта се дешава када се заглаве у кавезу без хране и какав утицај то има?<br/><br/>Ако је ухваћен у замку духова, Ц. сапидус ће имати канибалистичке тенденције све док последњи не умре од глади.<br/><br/>Како да дуплирамо фантомску замку у лабораторији?Створите фантомску замку затварањем улаза жичаном мрежом и зип-везамаКада се учитају узорци, затворите врх са зип-везама<br/><br/>Рак улаз затворен жичаном мрежом<br/><br/>Цраб ТрапВире МесхВире ЦуттерсРопеЦамераЗип Везе<br/><br/>Како да добијемо ракове?Замка неколико дана раније и гладују ихКада су спремни да почну, прикупљају нове ракове из замкиДодај директно у замку духова са КСНУМКС из изгладњелих резервоара<br/><br/>Шест ракова укупно, један недостајеПронађено је мало простора за бекство; закрпљено са зип-тиеДва краба мртваЈедан је оставио канџеДруги недостају оба весла и једна канџа<br/><br/>Четири краба жива и нетакнутаВелики мртав краб нема променеМањи мртав краб има само део карапине.<br/><br/>Последњи дан експериментаУзео два узоркаБез промене од другог дана у првом узоркуДруго посматрање, већи карапице одвојен од остатка тела / канџе<br/><br/>На основу резултата, одбацујем своју нулту хипотезу да ће ракови једноставно бити у замки.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Од првог појављивања видео игре Лара Крофт у Томб Раидер (1996), њени подухвати као авантуристички и брзи истраживач су широко резонирали са играчима, зарађујући јој место у пантеону великих ликова поп културе. Из тог разлога ћемо поставити Свет Ларе Крофт у центру пажње Сториворлд од 22. децембра 2021. до 6. марта 2022. године.<br/><br/>Црафтинг а Црофт<br/><br/>Лара Црофт је створио студио Цоре Десигн, у Дерби (Велика Британија), у 1996.

Након неког размишљања, рођена је Лара Црофт, млада, виша класа и потпуно британска жена, која је била загонетна и интелигентна као што је била тврда и самопоуздана.<br/><br/>Успех и контроверзе<br/><br/>Томб Раидер (1996) је био одвојени успех за Цоре Десигн, који се брзо удвостручио на изградњи Томб Раидер 2 (1997) и 3 (1998). Велики део успеха је приписан водећој дами игара, која је пронашла обожаваоце и са мушким и женским играчима.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Некретнине Реч дана: Опција<br/><br/>Опција: Споразум да остане отворен, за одређени период, понуда за продају или изнајмљивање некретнина. Опција се може користити, на примјер, како би се купцу дало вријеме за рјешавање питања финансирања, наслова, зонирања и изводљивости прије него што се купац обавезао на куповину. Опције се често користе у процесу монтаже земљишта. Опција мора бити подржана њеним стварним разматрањем, одвојено и независно од куповне цене имовине. Сама рецитал разматрања није довољна, осим у опцији закупа у којој су одредбе закупа саме по себи довољне да подрже опцију. Опција само ствара уговорно право; то не даје опционее било какву имовину у имовини. У тренутку потписивања опције, власник не продаје, нити купац купује, имовину. Иако је власник обавезан да прода ако је купац дао обавештење, купац није обавезан да купи. Опција за куповину је позната и као позив; опција за продају је позната као пут. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Предности каротеноида за кожу<br/><br/>Да ли сте чули за каротеноиде? Ове моћне фитокемикалије су пигментне компоненте које се налазе у биљкама које дају цвеће, воће и остављају своје жуте, наранџасте и црвене боје.<br/><br/>Од 1930-их, научници су идентификовали око 800 каротеноида, а око 40 их је пронађено у људском телу, укључујући и најтежи слој епидермиса, дермиса и поткожне масти. Најчешћи каротеноиди су бета-каротен, алфа-каротен, лутеин, зеаксантин, ликопен и астаксантин. Више о астаксантину можете прочитати овде.<br/><br/>На садржај каротеноида у кожи утичу бројни фактори, укључујући унос воћа и поврћа, њихову биорасположивост из разних намирница, суплементацију, изложеност УВ зрачењу, загађење ваздуха, конзумирање алкохола, пушење и стрес.<br/><br/>Како каротеноиди помажу мојој кожи?<br/><br/>Каротеноиди су неки од најпознатијих антиоксиданата за кожу и такође имају важне функције као антиинфламаторни агенси.<br/><br/>Здраво старење и поправку коже<br/><br/>Антиоксиданси су неопходни за здраву кожу јер помажу у спречавању оштећења слободних радикала ћелија. Оштећења слободних радикала узрокују прерано старење и појаву различитих врста рака коже. Каротеноиди, заједно са витамином Е, витамином Ц и Цо ензимом К10, су важни дермални антиоксиданти.<br/><br/>Због своје антиоксидативне активности, каротеноиди подржавају и подстичу производњу колагена и еластина у кожи. Ово помаже у повећању густине, дебљине, еластичности и чврстоће коже. Колаген и еластин се смањују како старимо, тако да је добијање довољно каротеноида у исхрани и локално критично за добро старење.<br/><br/>Каротеноиди могу побољшати знаке фотостарења, промене боје коже, еластичности, хидратације, текстуре и могу смањити губитак трансепидермалне воде.<br/><br/>Астаксантин посебно стимулише фибробласте да производе колаген и еластин, инхибира активност ензима који разбијају колаген и еластин, и показује антиинфламаторне и УВ-филтрирање ефекте. Показано је да смањује меланин у кожи, што резултира смањењем појаве пега и мелазме.<br/><br/>Анти-акне активност: антиинфламаторна активност каротеноида помаже у ублажавању упале и иритације повезане са акнама. Каротеноиди такође помажу у нормализацији и балансирању секрета уља из лојних жлезда. Они су вредни агенси у поправци коже и стимулишу регенерацију епидермиса, помажући у глаткој и омекшаној кожи.<br/><br/>Где могу пронаћи каротеноиде?<br/><br/>Постоје два начина да добијете дневну дозу каротеноида: кроз исхрану и кроз локалну примену. Комбинација оба је идеалан приступ доброј нези коже.<br/><br/>Каротеноиди су растворљиви у мастима, тако да вашем телу треба маст да их апсорбује (мислите на парадајз и маслиново уље, броколи и маслац, или спанаћ и авокадо). Уобичајени извори каротеноида у храни су авокадо, жуманце, купус, спанаћ, шаргарепа, слатки кромпир, папаја и парадајз.<br/><br/>Док се залажемо за добијање онолико хранљивих материја и антиоксиданата колико можете из хране, а не суплементације; једна студија је показала да астаксантин у комбинацији са хидролизатом колагена значајно побољшава интегритет баријере, смањује губитак трансепидермалне воде и повећава експресију проколагена типа И мРНК.<br/><br/>Актуелна примена је кључна за здраву кожу. Студије показују да високе концентрације антиоксиданата у људској кожи нуде најбољу заштиту за здраву кожу у било ком узрасту.<br/><br/>У Сарка Ботаницалс, ми мешамо богате каротеноидом, целе биљке као што су невен, маслачак и екстракти као што су астаксантин са хладно прешаним уљима и функционалним састојцима. Само невен садржи преко 19 различитих врста каротеноида. Ово може објаснити зашто има тако дугу историју употребе у нези коже. Студије показују да су каротеноиди помешани са коензимом К10 посебно ефикасни у смањењу упале и успоравању прераног старења коже због излагања сунцу. |
