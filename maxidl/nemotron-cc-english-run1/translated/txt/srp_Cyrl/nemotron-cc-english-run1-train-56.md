| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Иако признаје да је немогуће расправљати некога у љубави према нечему што мрзе, и обрнуто, и даље је често пријатно покушати аргумент. Када разговарамо са људима чија су мишљења у директној супротности са нашим, приморани смо да бранимо свој укус, дефинишемо своја мишљења и анализирамо зашто реагујемо на начин на који реагујемо.

Јер без обзира шта говори радио, још увијек постоји средина између "Ми се потпуно слажемо" и "Ја сам у праву, а ти си глуп и зао."<br/><br/>Сцотт: Откако смо разговарали о мом Сцотт Пилгрим Вс. Тхе Ворлд отпадништво, тражили смо случај у којем могу да вас позовем због тога што ми се не свиђа нешто дивно, и нисмо морали дуго тражити. Седели смо једни поред других током Мартина Сцорсесеа Хуго-ја, потпуно очарани његовим фантастичним поштовањем чуда ране неме кинематографије, а ви, очигледно, отпорни на сваком кораку. Критички консензус је био на мојој страни: погодио је 9. место на нашем колективном Топ 15-у (иако сте га навели као ваш прецењени избор), освојио (или поставио) у разним наградама филмских критичара, а тренутно ужива у 83 резултата на Метацритиц-у. То не значи да грешите, наравно, али на вама је да објасните зашто је Хуго, према вашим речима, "шупљи и вештачки", где су многи од нас то видели као дивно евоцирање Скорсезеовог детињства и медија када је још био у детињству. И молим вас, будите нежни док раскидате овог лептира по крилима.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Тасха: Не могу бити нежан, Сцотт. Понекад боли мање ако одједном откинете завој. (И чак и ако не, ко жели да шета около носећи пола откинутог завоја? Грозно.) Чињеница је да сам открио да је Хуго заморно манипулативна вежба у фалсификовању, почевши од његовог отварања клизања кроз железничку станицу у Паризу, што ме више подсећа на било шта од Поларног експреса Роберта Земецкиса. За разлику од Микеа Д'Ангела, ја сам љубитељ дугог, непрекинутог простора и подстицања гледалаца да несвесно задрже дах док камера истражује подручје; али када је простор који се истражује глатко, сјајно ЦГИ стварање, а камера плута кроз њега без тежине без физичког смисла да је камера или околина стварно тамо, то истраживање почиње да се осећа као неко. А остатак филма се осећао слично порелесс и нереално за мене, како у смислу његовог постављања, тако иу смислу његове високо измишљене, маудлин приче.<br/><br/>Не морам нужно имати проблем са произведеним, стилизованим окружењима у филму. Волео сам Баз Лухрманнов подједнако опсежан, потпуно вештачки снимљен Париз у Моулин Роугеу, на пример, али тај филм има осећај сопствене смешности, смисао за хумор о томе колико је намерно овер-тхе-топ. Дитто стилизације Јеан-Пиерре Јеунет, посебно у Амелие. (И Јеунет и Лухрманн осећао као јаке визуелне утицаје овде.) Имам осећај, међутим, да је Мартин Сцорсесе желео да се Хуго потпуно озбиљно. Иако је то још једна болно сентиментална прича о храбром сирочету које доноси боју у живот старог мрзовољца.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Ништа не уживам више у филму него што сам изненађен. И не постоји ништа што љутим и одупирем се више него што сам отворено манипулисан, гласно речено шта да осећам и када да то осећам. Добар филм чини такве ствари суптилно; лош користи срушене музичке знакове и слатке жице - иу овом случају, грубо, огромно око, разбацано сироче које тужно гледа у камеру - да захтева патос и да каже гледаоцима да су ужасни људи ако га не служе на захтев. То је рекао, могу се носити са тужном децом и мрзовољним одраслима који чине живот бољим једни за друге - стварно сам ископао овогодишњи Ле Хавр, који је у суштини био исти заплет без све слаткоће - али проналазим вештачка окружења која се лоше одражавају на вештачке емоције, а свака чини другу више лажну.<br/><br/>Почнимо са тим. У нашем занемареном филмском видео снимку, ти и Ноел сте обоје одвели Кеитха на задатак за заговарање Тираносаура, јер сте сматрали да то није довољно реалистично - превише измишљено, превише мизерно, превише, превише далеко. Како је могуће да не можете да купите стару лудаку која ломи ствари када је љута, али можете да купите сироче које живи унутар огромног сата на железничкој станици и креће на хировито путовање да поправи мистериозни аутомат за који верује да може да носи тајне од свог мртвог оца, али који га уместо тога води на чудно путовање самооткривања, у чаробну земљу филма? Да ли сте икада пронашли Хугов гауди рококо дизајн, агресивни срчани ланац, или колица-оптерећења чак и мало претерано или тешко прогутати?<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Сцотт: Јеунет и Лухрманн као утицаји на Сцорсесе?! Заборавите да будете непажљиви, сада ме намерно ударате оштрим штапом. Ако тражите инспирацију за Хуга - заправо, ако тражите емоционално језгро Хуга - морате се вратити Сцорсесеовом детињству у улици Елизабетх у Малој Италији, гдје је астматични мали дечак, неспособни да се игра напољу са другом дјецом, повукао се у фантазије Александра Корде попут Тхе Тхе Тхе Тхе Тхе Тхе Тхе Тхе Багхе Багхе. Или, једноставније, само идите право до самог извора: Џорџ Мелиес, чије путовање на Месец остаје Велики прасак свих филмских фантазија, тај тренутак када камера није коришћена да документује свет какав јесте, али оно што је хировито, магично, транспортно место које филмски стваралац жели да измисли за то. И та традиција је развијена и проширена деценијама пре него што су Јеунет и Лухрманн добили своје грубе мале шапе на њој.<br/><br/>Говорећи о Јеунету, добар покушај да ми одузме реторичко оружје, али ћу то ипак рећи: Како можете волети Амелие, а ипак наћи Хуга синтетичким и "претераним" и "досадно манипулативним"? Кажете да Амелие и Моулин Роуге имају откупни "осјећај [своје] смешности" гдје Сцорсесе значи да озбиљно схватамо Хуга, а ја не мислим да је то случај, барем у посљедњој тачки. Да Скорсезе осећа очигледну страст према филмовима је, претпостављам, зашто бисте тумачили Хуга као самоозбиљног. Али за мене, та осећања дају филму емоционални баласт који филмови Лурман и Јеунет немају. Сва три филма агресивно користе чуда ЦГИ-а и Сцорсесе додаје 3Д у микс, на диван ефекат - али где се ти и ја разликујемо је питање бестежинског. Слажем се да ЦГИ има ефекат дистанцирања; светови састављени у потпуности од дигиталног пластелина су флексибилни до тачке у којој понекад немају присуство. Поменули сте Хуга у вашем уносу "Прекомерно" за наш најбољи филмски комад као "ЦГИ гимцрацк" - савршен дис ... за други филм.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Поштено је рећи да је Сцорсесе изградио Хуго око стандардног издања, "срчане врпце" дјечје књиге / филма: Сиротиња пропушта свог тату, ствара свој мали свијет фантазије, гломи на новог пријатеља, увјерава старог старца да се омекша и можда га усвоји. Али то је само наративни скелет, а Скорсезе пружа пуно меса и крви. За једну, не можете гледати Хуга, усамљеног дечака, који гледа од сатница до вреве железничке станице у Паризу, а да не помислите на Скорсезеа, још једног усамљеног дечака, који гледа кроз прозор своје спаваће собе у улици Елизабетх. Чак и ако нисте довољно велики филмски штребер да направите ту везу, стварно осећам да Хугово путовање није у проналажењу нове очеве фигуре, већ у истрајавању са механичком магијом која стоји као наслеђе његовог оца. То је оно што је филм: упорност визије која нам омогућава да прихватимо илузорну верзију света на 24 фрејма у секунди је наука и магија одједном. Хугов однос са Мелиесом није о томе да се удобан до новог тате, већ о заједничком ентузијазму који је стари човек потопио у горчину. За мене, то је далеко јединственији угао на потенцијално куповину.<br/><br/>Да ли сте заиста пронашли ниједан од Хуга очаравајући? Чак и неколико критичара филма изгледа да су спремни да признају да су секвенце које евоцирају историју филма и Мелиесовог студија - са Мицхаелом Стулбаргом као херојским филмским научником! - биле сјајне. Осећао се, на најбољи могући начин, као надувена компресија моје класе Историје филма 101 на колеџу, кондензујући семестарску вриједност клипова и контекста у нешто између монтаже и анимиране поп-уп књиге. И говори о генијалном дизајну филма, који слојеве чињеница и фантазије тако лепо да је одједном историја Мелијеса и рођења кинематографије, и само нека врста једноставног, раскошно произведеног филмског чуда које би Скорсезе волео као дете. Хвала Богу Хуго не прати модел Јеунет / Лухрманн и има "осјећај властите смешности". Као познавалац фантазије, зар не бисте рекли да има вредности у томе да га играте равно и озбиљно и бесрамно, а не да намигујете публици? Можда вам је Хуго болестан сладак, али не мислим да је аутентичност његовог осећања негирана.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Тасха: Да, заправо сам пронашао делове Хуго очаравајуће. (Приметите како сам одговорио на ваше питање унапред, док сте били превише заузети пјеном са апоплексије да се обрати мој, иако претпостављам да је то одговор у свом праву. Ок, "утицај" може бити преувеличавање случаја - само сам мислио да је визуелни стил изгледао врло познато. Иако је Кеитх истакао када сте ово лично подигли, Сцорсесе се не противи цртању инспирације из туђих визуела, нити је имун на то.) Прије свега, био сам очаран деловима који се баве причом Жоржа Мелијеса, његовом љубављу према филму, радом који је уложио у своју умјетност и радошћу коју је изашао из ње. Постоји ужасно много лепоте и забаве у поставци подводне сцене из Мелиесове "Фаириланд", ау низу на крају, фокусирајући се на Мелиесове снимке. Признајем да је Хугова веза са Мелиесом због заједничке љубави према филму леп додир, а ја уживам у добром филму о снимању филмова.<br/><br/>Али Хуго није првенствено о филму, упркос Мелиесовим везама. Поред тема које наводите, ради се и о проналажењу ваше сврхе, као што ликови изричито, напорно објашњавају једни другима и нама. И ради се о спектаклу, и великим акцијским сетпиецес, и јури, и срећно-увек-после-крајева где чак и љути насилник и стидљиви старији пар и фергавдсакес чак и несташни јазавац сви се упарити са шармантним љубавним интересима до краја. Ради се о супер-преурањеној Хермиони Грејнџер, која је шефица и наметљива и паметна и хвали магичне светове затворене у књигама.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Да, Сцорсесе се игра са архетиповима. Проблем је у томе што никада нисам осетио да их је прожео нечим новим, свежим или уверљивим, упркос сопственој причи. Ја бих много више волео причу о младом Сцорсесеу који одраста са астмом - нешто мало и стварно, без огромних соба пуних ЦГИ сатова и златних сјајних прашинских мотора и пророчких снова и бесног одраслог тиранина-гарда са срцем од злата - све то превелико, преко врха глупости. Настављате да наводите Скорсезеову личну позадину и љубав према филму као доказ да он заиста осећа оно што ставља на екран, али не осећам његов лични додир у било ком од ових, осим тренутака који су изричито о филму. Основне емоције могу бити стварне, али то не чини извршење мање лажним.<br/><br/>Кажете да се аутентичност емоције не може порећи. Не доводим у питање да ли се Сцорсесе лично осећао усамљено и изоловано као дете, али не осећам усамљеност и изолацију на екрану - видим гомилу претераних знакова (Хуго је прљав и његова одећа се носи и сви одрасли вичу на њега и редовно га јури застрашујући пас!) и велике ударце, са викањем и плакањем и Спи-Спи. За мене, искреност је убедљивија и личнија када је тиха и директна; када неко виче своје мишљење на мене, претпостављам да је или стварно љут, или само покушава да преплави моја чула да ме спречи да изразим своје мишљење. Хуго је био дугачки крик, што се мене тиче.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Зашто нисам добио тај осећај фалсификовања од Амели, питате? Потпуно ћу признати да су Амелие и Моулин Роуге и велике, манипулативне, вештачке конструкције у истом вену, које захтевају специфичне емоције у одређеним интервалима, и покушавају да продају те емоције са тешким емотивним и агресивним соундтрацком. Ниједан од њих ме није стварно продао својим емоцијама као аутентично људско осећање. Оно што сам уживао у ова два филма била је конструкција - посебно Амелијеве надувене, смешне листе случајних карактеристичних особина и искустава за њену глуму, и Мулен Ружове музичко-магијеве мешавине и реконтекстуализације. Често ме продају на причама које раде креативне или амбициозне ствари са структуром, а оба та филма се квалификују, где је Хуго много линеарнији, стандардни потрага за децом.<br/><br/>Али на крају, за мене, стварно се своди на осећај да су ти филмови глупости, док је Хуго намењен да се озбиљно схвата у сваком треацли тренутку. Не мислите да је то истина - али истовремено браните његов интегритет у смислу његове апсолутно аутентичне, укорењене емоције историје Скорсезеа и кажете ми да грешим, а он не значи да се то схвата озбиљно. Како помирити та два изјаве? Шта је са филмом вам сугерише да то није требало да се узима по номиналној вредности? И да ли је могуће да је ово само још једна радознала ситуација Бењамина Буттона у којој користим децу у филмовима са великим буџетом да буду углавном сапи и мелодраматични, док ви као тата сматрате да заобилазите свој цинизам и одлазите директно у свој породични осећај?<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Сцотт: Нисам сигуран да сам мислио да Сцорсесе не значи да се озбиљно схвата; само је изабрао хировито возило кроз које ће изразити озбиљну љубав према филмовима. Када кажете, "Али Хуго није првенствено о филму, упркос Мелиес-овим везицама", збуњен сам. Признајем да сте пронашли многе елементе Хугове превише познате и мукотрпне и пуне Спиелберговог чуда-емоционалног - не могу ништа да урадим да се расправљам око те перцепције, коју други Хугови сумњачи деле. Понекад филм значи шармирати и очарати, а за неке то не значи; имате Хуго и имам Амелие, иако мислим да ово друго, намерно вештачко, значи да нам је романтично. (Уместо, рецимо, неке ужасне механичке измишљотина погодна за наставак Сав.)<br/><br/>Али да кажем да Хуго није првенствено о филму? Ако није о филму, онда је то најбесмисленија дискурзивна прича о [о чему год да мислите да је] коју сам икада видео. Однос између Хуга и Мелиеса је срце филма, а у срцу тога није само нека веза између Плуцки Орпхан и Црусти Олд Гуи Витх А Хеарт оф Голд, већ заједнички афинитет за инжењерску магију - посебно магију филмова. Мислим да су Скорсезе и његови сарадници пронашли начин да изразе свој ентузијазам у раним данима кинематографије кроз фантазију која је доступна свим узрастима. Прича за децу испуњена архетипом је само кора овде; биоскоп је пита. (Мммм... нога.)<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Што се тиче радозналог случаја Бењамина Буттона, не видим много везе, осим што покушавам да ме изложим као браниоца Бењамина Буттона као начин да оштетим свој кредибилитет. (Успут, како су додаци на том Г.И. Јое: Пораст Цобра Блу-раи?) Рекао сам вам да је нови тата у мени који је лишен сна можда био рањив на Бенџамина Батона, али не могу да замислим време када ме претпоставка старења у обрнутом не би померила. Како то не утиче на вас?) Осим тога, не видим како Бенџамин Батон много говори о Хугу као филму о деци, јер је то само мали део приче која се протеже много већом путањом.<br/><br/>Дакле, да ли сам вас убедио? Вероватно не. Али ми је драго да сазнам да Хуго није био потпуно лишен чаролија за вас. Секвенце на Мелиесу филмском ствараоцу су оно што је Хуго ставио за мене - и у томе, барем, можемо поделити неку филмску љубав.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Таша: Не, не могу да кажем да си ме убедио, више него што сам те убедио. Немогуће је расправљати било кога у висцералној љубави према било чему, а стварно би требало да буде једнако немогуће разговарати са неким од висцералне љубави. Углавном, дозволили сте ми да видим Хуга у Сцотт-О-Висион-у, што је занимљиво искуство; барем сам сада благо убеђен да нисмо некако успели да видимо потпуно различите филмове који су некако имали исто име и редитеља.<br/><br/>Свакако смо имали различита искуства, мада, и по мом мишљењу, фокусирали смо се на различите аспекте продукције: још увијек не видим тему "филм је диван" као појединачну нит филма, колико и један од превише. "Бесмислено дискурзивно" скоро га покрива, иако бих га бацио "често непотребно слатко и драгоцено" на врху тога. Док сте фокусирани на укусно пуњење пите филма, осећам се као да је та пита била прекривена фунтом кристализованог шећера, и мислим да то чини разлику, без обзира на основну поруку филма или шачицу сјајних сцена. Погледајте такође Бенџамин Батон, који нисам подигао само да бих вас љуљао - стварно мислим да имате више сентименталне траке него што радим у вези са децом у биоскопу, посебно када се више користе као симболи рањивости и невиности него као људски ликови. Хеј, знате који филм у потпуности нема слатке широке очи мапете који доносе наду циничном свету? Г.И. Јое: Успон кобре. Можда ћу ићи да гледам оне Блу-раи додатке. Могао бих да користим неки експлозивни инсулин да надокнадим Хугову слаткоћу. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Надала сам се да ће моја ћерка бити ослобођена од тешких и узнемирујућих времена": Прича Мее Мее-а као избегличке маме<br/><br/>Нада у време кризе: Прича о Дану мајке<br/><br/>Џудит Сантијаго*<br/><br/>Ми Ми је чуо да војници долазе. Ухватила је свог сина и бесно се придружила осталим сељанима који су трчали према тајландско-бурманској граници, где се налазила Канцеларија Високог комесара Уједињених нација за избеглице (УНХЦР). Њен муж је био у другом селу које је трчало у супротном правцу, Мее је касније сазнала. Након што је потрага за војницима завршена, Мее се вратила кући у своје мало село у Коецхи, Бурма.<br/><br/>Током 1997-2000, Мее и хиљаде попут ње живело је под сталном претњом насиља од стране бурманских војника. Многи људи би се привремено склонили у џунглу и вратили кући у своје село након што су војници напустили подручје, само да би то урадили поново неколико дана касније. Отприлике једном недељно, Мее и други би били у покрету како би избегли заробљавање, силовање или смрт од стране војника.<br/><br/>Током једног инцидента, Мееов муж је трчао испред своје жене како би обезбедио храну за своју породицу. Њен муж је уочен од стране војника и убијен. Метак је разбио део његовог ребра, остављајући га тешко рањеног и у невољи док је путовао према џунгли са својом породицом ради сигурности.<br/><br/>Три месеца, Миин муж се крио и померао породицу са узнемирујућом раном на његовој страни. Није добио никакву медицинску помоћ, осим Меине неге.<br/><br/>"Била сам уплашена да се вратим у Бурму", рекла је Мее преко преводиоца. "Бојала сам се умирања. Плакала сам и плакала сваки дан", наставила је.<br/><br/>Њен муж је на крају стекао довољно снаге да пет дана хода према малом селу на Тајланду где су сазнали локацију болнице и избегличког кампа.

Мее је тада шестогодишњи син помогао у испоруци његове сестре по имену Ех Ку Хсер. Њено име значи љубав - хладно - слатко. "Хладно" у бурманској култури значи да не прође кроз ватру живота, јер топлота представља проблематична времена.<br/><br/>"Надала сам се да ће моја ћерка бити слободна од тешких и узнемирујућих времена", рекла је Мее. "Нисам желела да прође кроз оно што сам искусила", наставила је.<br/><br/>За Мее, рођење њене ћерке усред таме, муке и страха, било је симбол наде за нови живот који долази.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Афирмативна акција је резултат покрета за грађанска права из 1960-их, који је израстао из Закона о грађанским правима из 1964. године који је забранио дискриминацију на основу расе, етничке припадности или пола. Била је то одлука Врховног суда из 1978. године, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, која је омогућила употребу расних преференција као средства за подстицање различитости, омогућавајући афирмативну акцију која се користи у политикама пријема. Настао је са намером да се обезбеде једнаке могућности за припаднике мањинских група у образовању и ...погледајте средину документа...<br/><br/>Међутим, према извештају истраживачког центра Пју из 2007. године, подршка афирмативној акцији међу америчком јавношћу се заправо значајно повећала у последњих неколико година, попевши се са 58% у 1995. години на 70% у 2007. години. Присталице афирмативне акције праве многе аргументе у прилог афирмативној акцији, у нади да ће други видети истинско добро које афирмативне политике актина доносе нашем друштву. Присталице верују да је афирмативна акција више од процеса, а не политике пријема. Колеџи и универзитети предузимају додатну иницијативу да досегну мањинске групе, подстичући их да се пријаве. Колеџи и универзитети нуде додатну финансијску помоћ и пружају ресурсе на кампусу како би помогли боље образовање ученика на колеџу. Присталице такође примећују растући број пријава мањина на колеџима и универзитетима делимично због политике афирмативне акције.<br/>Статистике су доказале да када је афирмативна акција елиминисана, као што је када је био на Беркли колеџу и УЦЛА 1998. године, пријем мањинских студената је пао за 61 одсто и 36 одсто, што доказује да афирмативна акција игра главну улогу у процесу пријема мањинских студената. Присталице афирмативне акције такође верују да разноликост у високом образовању пружа бољу образовну атмосферу за све студенте, лично и интелектуално. Ако би афирмативне акције биле елиминисане, било би мање мањинских студената уписаних на колеџе, што би довело до тога да је разноликост прилично танка. Политика афирмативне акције је такође неопходна како би се надокнадили векови расног, економског и социјалног угњетавања. Појединци са вишим социоекономским статусом имају више могућности од оних са нижим социоекономским пореклом. Присталице верују да су одређене расне или етничке групе у неповољном положају јер су често у домаћинствима са нижим приходима и стога нису изложене истим ресурсима као студенти из виших социо-економских класа. Заговорници подржавају појам конкуренције између студената на основу заслуга, али тврде да афирмативна акција компензује економске разлике. Дипломци колеџа, који су имали користи од афирмативне акције, такође су рекли да су добили боље послове, зарадили више новца и уопште живе боље животе због срећних прилика које су добили кроз афирмативну акцију.<br/>Присталице афирмативне акције континуирано наглашавају озбиљну важност афирмативне акције, с обзиром на њен допринос унапређењу и искуства колеџа и друштва у целини. Међутим, противници афирмативне акције верују да је дошло време да се оконча афирмативна акција. Противници верују да је афирмативна акција створена како би се осигурала фер пракса пријема како би се донела промена у дугом периоду расне дискриминације. Они верују да је политика застарела.

Универзитет Јужне Каролине Колумбија<br/>Кампус је угостио бројне бесплатне, јавне програме који почињу 17. августа.<br/><br/>У петак, 18. августа, соларни физичар др Сарбани Басу, катедра за астрономију на Универзитету Јејл, разговарао је о историји помрачења Сунца и шта је човечанство научило од њих на јавном предавању.<br/><br/>У недељу, 20. августа, посетиоци кампуса учествовали су у серији бесплатних, 30-минутних разговора од стране УСЦ факултета и гостујућих научника Рамесх Капоор, Герардо Васкуез, Јамес Овердуин и Кристин Симунац.<br/><br/>Одржана у Инжењерском центру Свеаринген, серија је угостила стручњаке који су разговарали о улози помрачења у науци и друштву и како су помрачења утицала на митове и легенде кроз историју.<br/><br/>Посетиоци Спирит Цоммуницатионс Парк-а на дан помрачења били су позвани да истраже степени здравља са УофСЦ-ом на иМАГИНЕ СТЕМ фестивалу. Овај пуни дан забаве укључивао је интерактивне СТЕМ експонате (науку, технологију, инжењеринг и математику) из УофСЦ-а и других организација. Улазнице су укључивале и 1:05 пм.<br/>Цолумбиа Фирефлиес вс. Рим Храбри игра и Тотал Ецлипсе оф тхе Парк.<br/><br/>За оне који су више волели да превазиђу врућину и гледају помрачење унутра, понудили смо гледање емисије Ецлипсе Мегацаст НАСА ТВ-а у неколико подручја широм Цолумбиа Цампус-а.<br/><br/>Различити стручњаци посетили су локације широм кампуса како би поделили како су помрачења уткана у нашу науку, културу, историју и уметност. Алисон Марш, Стивен Родни, Мајкл Вајзенбург, Скот Вајт, Варша Кулкарни, Нејт Карнс и Зенлонг Ли су били домаћини 20-минутних јавних дискусија које су довеле до помрачења.<br/><br/>Одељење за физику и астрономију управљало је са 10 станица за посматрање на отвореном и 5 станица за посматрање у затвореном простору широм кампуса са телескопима, активностима и / или НАСА-ом. Гледаоци су могли да бирају своје искуство помрачења са приступом стручним дискусијама и телескопској технологији или забавним активностима као што су диск голф и породични занати.<br/><br/>УСЦ-ов натуралиста у резиденцији Руди Манцке посјетио је гледаоце на историјској Потковица како би дијелио природу помрачења Сунца, што је довело до 2,5 минута укупности почевши од 2:41 пм.<br/><br/>Након што се сунце у потпуности поново појавило, универзитет је био домаћин Ецлипсе пријема за растуће средњошколце и предстојеће дипломце.<br/><br/>Касно поподне, Дарла Мооре Сцхоол оф Бусинесс одржао је бесплатан, јавни говор др Цраиг Робертс, истакнутог професора и вишег физичара у Националној лабораторији Аргонне, једној од националних лабораторија за научна и инжењерска истраживања Министарства енергетике САД. У својој дискусији "Постављање Божје честице на одмор", др Робертс је разговарао о Хигсовом бозону и зашто се не може користити за идентификацију извора више од 98% видљиве масе универзума.<br/><br/>Велики дан је коначно дошао до краја на стадиону Виллиамс Брице где су посетиоци могли да уживају у звездама универзитета. Отворена пракса фудбалског тима КСНУМКС Гамецоцк била је савршен крај феноменалног дана.<br/><br/>Истицање историје<br/><br/>Посетиоци кампуса могли су да се мешају заједно са стручњацима за помрачење и сви близу и далеко су позвани да деле ово искуство једном у животу. Сазнајте више о томе како смо поздравили овај историјски догађај:<br/><br/>НАСА званичној локацији<br/><br/>Били смо почаствовани што смо добили име Службена локација за гледање од стране НАСА. Гледаоци на нашим КСНУМКС станицама за гледање на кампусу уживали су у приступу стручњацима везаним за помрачење и другим образовним могућностима док су сигурно уживали у помрачењу сунца. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Рођендани<br/><br/>Неки људи у вашој организацији можда не желе да вам дају датум рођења. Инфоодле вам омогућава да уклоните годину рођења особе! Да бисте то урадили:<br/><br/>Када додате особу, кликните на дугме Сакриј годину да бисте уклонили годину рођења за ту особу.<br/><br/>Алтернативно, приликом уређивања особе пронађите поље рођења за вашу веб локацију. Кликните на дугме Уреди, а затим кликните на Сакриј годину и сачувајте.<br/><br/>Лако тако!<br/><br/>Напомена: Особа која је уклонила годину рођења неће се појавити у било којим извештајима у вези са критеријумима старости и класификована је као одрасла особа јер је њихов датум рођења заправо постављен на 1902. годину! Поље датума рођења се обично налази у одељку са информацијама, али га је администратор можда преместио под другу картицу. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Комбинације<br/><br/>Комбинације су одбрана од ударца, кореографирани одговори на различите врсте напада. Имају много имена широм борилачких вештина, али (по мом искуству) свака уметност има њихову верзију. То их чини другачијим од облика јер постоји много борилачких вештина које немају облике. Шта чини партнерске вежбе тако универзалним? Зашто вежбати одређени одговор када (у стварности) тајминг, тип напада, величина нападача и стотину других фактора ће то учинити тако да никада не користите тај читав кореографски одговор? И на крају, како можемо вежбати за стварну одбрамбену ситуацију и истовремено избјећи повреде?<br/><br/>Универзалност комбинација је импресивна, у најмању руку. Наш стил Кенпо каратеа има листу од 108 комбинација које се могу научити. (Већина студената учи само 20-30 иако) У бразилском Јиу-Јитсу-у проводите читаве часове вежбајући шипке и гушилице, учећи сваку суптилност у потезу док ваш партнер нуди мало или нимало отпора. Сваки боксер је провео сате испред торбе и / или огледала бацајући исту комбинацију удараца док се њихово тело не креће само рефлексом. Комбинације су универзалне јер немамо бољи начин да уведемо кретање, а затим вежбамо суптилне позиције потребне за њихово функционисање. Погађање мале тачке притиска кроз одећу узима пуно праксе, хватање шипке за руке са контролом захтева пажљиво постављен кук и подмукло подешавање, а одлична комбинација је корисна само ако можете да га прођете из уравнотеженог и заштићеног положаја. Можете ли смислити бољи начин да стекнете ове вештине?<br/><br/>Постоји велики број фактора који одређују како реагујете на напад и да ли у спаринг утакмици или у борби НИКАДА нисам користио пуну комбинацију у своју одбрану. Зашто онда проводимо сате вежбајући их? Вежбамо ове кореографске одговоре јер циљ није да извучете комбинацију КСНУМКС-а сваки пут када видите ударац куком, већ да вам покажемо један начин да га блокирате, а затим могући начин да га пратите. Никада нисам одлучио да користим комбинацију КСНУМКС у ситуацији стварности, али блок је један од мојих потеза. Комбинације додају алате у кутију са алатима које не поправљају аутомобил.<br/><br/>Последње питање је питање сигурности. Ако вежбамо ради стварности, морамо да реплицирамо стварност. Како да спречимо повреду док то радимо? Када је у питању, ради се о изградњи поверења. Почињемо споро и учимо да верујемо да имамо контролу над собом. Такође учимо да верујемо да наши партнери имају контролу. У више времена учимо да верујемо нашој контроли над нашим партнером и (мало страшније) учимо да верујемо контроли нашег партнера над нама. На крају (са пуно праксе) можете да се крећете су пуну брзину, бацање свог партнера, и да се баци без страха од повреде.<br/><br/>Комбинације су универзалне са разлогом; они се практикују тако да се могу раздвојити на њихове делове, а ми остајемо сигурни почевши споро и градећи поверење. Као и све остало у борилачким вештинама, комбинације имају много разлога за своју праксу и извршење. |
