| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote.

Џонсон потписао је Закон о гласачким правима из 1965. године.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Пре скоро једног века, 15. амандман на Устав је навео: "Право грађана Сједињених Држава да гласају не може бити ускраћено или скраћено од стране Сједињених Држава или било које државе због расе, боје или претходног стања ропства." И скоро век пре тога, очеви оснивачи наше нације покренули су велики експеримент америчке демократије изјавом да су "сви људи створени једнаки".<br/><br/>Закон о гласачким правима из 1965. године био је одложено признање да чак иу Америци наши темељни идеали имају малу тежину ако нису заштићени владавином права. Зато је члан 2 15. амандмана дао Конгресу "овлашћење да спроведе овај члан одговарајућим законодавством".<br/><br/>И заиста, кодификовани језик Закона о гласачким правима био је у стању да постигне оно што Конгрес из доба реконструкције и Томас Џеферсон нису могли. Закон о грађанским правима из 1964. године и Закон о гласачким правима - и покрет за грађанска права из којих су настали - служили су као катализатор за драматично повећање могућности за црне Американце да учествују у демократском процесу.<br/><br/>На пример, само 6,7 одсто црних Миссиссиппианс су регистровани да гласају од 1962; до 1969 та бројка је достигла 66.5 одсто. Данас, Миссиссиппи има више црних изабраних званичника него било која друга држава.<br/><br/>Заштита која је уведена Законом о гласачким правима била је дуготрајна када су усвојена, што је представљало тешку борбу са којом су постигнута. Али незамисливо, ове заштите су сада под нападом, угрожавајући напредак који је наша нација тако напорно радила да постигне.<br/><br/>Прошле године, у случају Схелби Цоунти против Холдера, Врховни суд САД-а исцрпио је кључну компоненту Закона о гласачким правима која је омогућила претходну федералну ревизију како би се осигурала недискриминација прије него што било који нови закон о гласању ступи на снагу.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Нажалост, одговор републиканских лидера је био да ништа не предузму. Сенатор Тед Круз и гувернер Рик Пери су изашли из свог пута да похвале одлуку Врховног суда. Сенатор Ренд Пол је одбацио континуирану потребу за Законом о гласачким правима, напомињући: "Имамо афро-америчког председника."<br/><br/>„Иако је избор председника Барака Обаме заиста био историјска прекретница, опасно је мислити да нас то ослобађа од будности према дуготрајним последицама прошлости наше нације. Журба са којом су државе кренуле да усвоје ограничења гласања је потврда да су заштите које су успостављене одељком 4 и даље неопходне.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Републикански гувернери потписали су строга ограничења фото-идентификације у закону као решење за практично непостојећи проблем имитирања гласача, непропорционално повређујући жене, младе људе, радне породице и афро-америчку заједницу. Недостојно је да републиканци попут Пола траже гласове ових заједница када верују да „нема ничег лошег“ у постављању ограничења која отежавају гласање овим изборним јединицама.<br/><br/>Републиканци су такође настојали да ограниче периоде превременог гласања, укључујући и недељу пре избора, када су цркве афроамеричке цркве имале велики успех са програмима Душе на изборима.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Ова ограничења представљају безобзирни напор републиканаца да ојачају гласање, засновано на уским, краткорочним политичким прорачунима да републиканци могу победити на изборима смањењем величине бирачког тела.<br/><br/>Демократе имају сасвим другачију мисију када је у питању гласање: да осигурају да се сваки бирач који има право гласа може регистровати, да сваки регистровани бирач може гласати и да се сваки глас тачно рачуна.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Пројекат проширења гласача Демократског националног комитета одражава наше увјерење да веће учешће бирача јача нашу нацију и нашу демократију. Наставићемо да користимо наше неупоредиво институционално знање како бисмо заштитили гласачка права против законодавства и тактике која би покушала да сузбије гласање. И зато што је најбоља одбрана добар напад, такође радимо на проширењу гласања распоређивањем наше технологије и ресурса података за регистрацију нових бирача.<br/><br/>На ову годишњицу, један од најбољих начина на који можемо одати почаст онима који су се борили - ау неким случајевима и дали своје животе - јер је усвајање закона за републиканце у Конгресу да се придруже демократама у доношењу Закона о амандманима на гласачка права како би обновили обећање Закона о гласачким правима из 1965. године.<br/><br/>Оглашавање<br/><br/>Деббие Вассерман Сцхултз, демократа, представља 23. конгресни округ Флориде у Конгресу Сједињених Држава.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Питања и одговори: Стручњак за заштиту Ватикана отац Ханс Золлнер СЈ<br/><br/>13 јун 2021<br/><br/>Отац Ханс Золлнер СЈ. Слика: Аустралијски језуити.<br/><br/>Председник Центра за заштиту деце на Грегоријанском универзитету у Риму и члан Папске комисије за заштиту малолетника, отац Ханс Золлнер СЈ, био је у Аустралији 2018. године како би разговарао са лидерима католичког министарства и преживелима.<br/><br/>Мицхаел МцВеигх из језуитских комуникација сјео је с њим током посјете како би истражио како Црква реагује на кризу злостављања на међународном нивоу и шта се може научити из наших искустава у Аустралији.<br/><br/>ММ: Ово је ваше треће путовање у Аустралију. Посетили сте доста других земаља да бисте видели како Црква реагује на злостављање широм света. Можете ли нам дати неку идеју о томе како изгледа глобална слика?<br/><br/>Ханс Золлнер СЈ<br/><br/>ХЗ: Моје разумевање, након што сам посетио око 50 земаља на пет или шест континената, је да Црква заиста почиње да се креће у последњих неколико година по питању правде према жртвама, да их слуша и да ради све што се може у погледу заштите.<br/><br/>Био сам са језуитским провинцијалима из целе Африке крајем априла, а председник језуитске асистенције Африке и Мадагаскара је веома посвећен и посвећен томе. Он је изнео темељан акциони план за формирање и увођење смерница свуда. То је веома пажљив и веома намеран напор да се уради све што се може учинити да се активно ангажује као језуити у Африци - на континенту где је до пре неколико година све ово било страни језик.<br/><br/>Један од изазова у покушају да се развије овај глобални приступ је да се баве толико култура, и толико различитих разумевања. Како то уклапате и покушавате да пружите обуку и подршку верским заједницама које се баве овим питањима?<br/><br/>Ово је једно од главних питања које имамо. Мислим да оно што могу да урадим је да стимулишем дискусију, стимулишем размишљање и припремим људе што је више могуће како би могли да раде на темељима.<br/><br/>Центар за заштиту дјеце на Грегоријанском универзитету не претвара се да има одговор на свако питање. Не само зато што не знамо одређене контексте - можда знамо неке од њих, али говоримо о хиљадама култура, говоримо о стотинама језика, говоримо о веома различитим правним позадинама. Разликује се чак и понекад у једној земљи, као што је Аустралија, где имате државе у оквиру Комонвелта Аустралије које имају различите законе од других држава.<br/><br/>Ја сам неко ко покушава да изазове и стимулише дискусију и размишљање. Такође сам веома срећан да слушам људе.<br/><br/>Очигледно смо имали Краљевску комисију овде у Аустралији, али који су неки од других начина на које сте видели да се гласови жртава подржавају широм света?<br/><br/>У Француској постоји једна епархија која је успоставила оно што називају "простором за слушање". Тамо жртве могу изаћи и могу се изразити. Присутан је бискуп. То је отворен простор у којем су људи који су били изузетно повређени слободни да бар изразе оно што желе да затраже од црквеног руководства итд.<br/><br/>Постоје и друга места у Сједињеним Државама или другим земљама где су жртве биле позване од стране епархија, од стране провинција, од стране руководства Цркве, да иступе. Морам да кажем да свеукупно мислим да постоји добра воља, а има више људи попут епископа и провинцијалаца који слушају жртве него што знамо. Али не постоји ниједан модел давања жртвама не само простора да се изразе и буду саслушане, већ и да се активно ангажују у развоју Цркве.<br/><br/>Што се тиче постављања простора за подршку жртвама, које су неке од ствари које сте видели које би заиста могле помоћи - и које бисмо могли размотрити овде у Аустралији?<br/><br/>Једна од главних тачака које многе жртве помињу је: "Зар не можемо имати, унутар парохије, унутар школа, редовни разговор који укључује преживјеле злостављања као редовне чланове одбора, комисије, звучне табле, групе за повратне информације или нешто слично?" Тако да се тај глас не доноси само у одређеној прилици, или где се особа осећа као да је у стању да говори о томе, већ [се чује] редовно - уградите тај глас у систем.<br/><br/>То ће помоћи свима нама. То ће помоћи преживелима и жртвама јер ће се осећати добродошлим и цењеним у специфичном искуству, иу специфичним животним изазовима кроз које су прошли. Друго, то ће помоћи заједници у целини, јер можемо барем постати све осетљивији на то шта су бриге и специфичне потребе преживелих - што такође може да говори о потребама младих људи.<br/><br/>М: Имамо јаке групе преживелих овде у Аустралији који су били у стању да подрже једни друге кроз тај процес. Али оно што хоћете да кажете је да нам је потребан неки начин да подржимо те групе, и да подржимо те људе, и кроз наше институције?<br/><br/>И мислим да треба да будемо креативни. То ће радити за једну школу и једну парохију и једну епархију на један начин, а за друге на другачији начин. Зато што преживели са којима сам у сталном контакту имају сличне захтеве и слична искуства у погледу тога да ли су примљени у Цркву или не – осећај избачености или одбацивања. Али они такође имају међу собом сасвим различита очекивања. Тако сам научио да такође морате бити веома спремни да прихватите разлике у ономе што ова специфична група, или овај специфични преживели, жели, захтева и потреба.<br/><br/>М: Преживјели говоре о жељи да се њихове приче чују и признају. Имали смо Краљевску комисију овде у Аустралији, која је обезбедила независан процес у којем би жртве могле да се појаве. Да ли постоји потреба за нечим таквим у смислу истине, правде и процеса помирења за Цркву на међународном нивоу?<br/><br/>Х: Да, мислим да постоји потреба за тим на међународном нивоу. Али мислим да пре свега свака локална црква треба да уради свој домаћи задатак. Не видим да ће се ускоро десити да неки такав сабор или комисија буду основани да би се у овој области размотрила цела Црква. Црква има 1,3 милијарде чланова, а присутна је у 190 земаља, са свим врстама разлика у очекивањима у погледу психолошке, духовне и финансијске подршке.<br/><br/>Постоји једна ствар са којом сам се стално сусрео у комуникацији, раду са жртвама и слушању жртава, а то је да они желе да буду саслушани. Дакле, ако је постојао осећај да су жртве стално слушане - у Риму и другде - мислим да би то пружило велико олакшање многим жртвама.<br/><br/>Мислим да је забринутост папе Франциска, посебно у вези са вашим питањем, да локалне цркве чине све што могу како би жртве биле саслушане у тој земљи. Имам листу људи који желе да разговарају директно са Светим Оцем, а физички је то немогуће. Био сам тамо у КСНУМКС-у да преведем за два немачка преживела која су изабрана са два ирска и два енглеска преживела када је примио шест од њих код куће. Узео је читаво јутро да их слуша један за другим. За сваког од њих, био је тамо 40 до 45 минута. Да је то урадио за сваког преживелог, више није могао да спава.<br/><br/>Његов пример је модел за целу Католичку цркву како се жртве и преживели примају, поздрављају и слушају. Мислим да ако би епископи и провинцијали у овом свету, у свим земљама, следили његов пример, многи преживели би заиста били захвални за то.<br/><br/>Архиепископ Диармуд Мартин је недавно цитиран непосредно пре Светског састанка породица, о Папској комисији, рекавши да је премала јер је тренутно успостављена да би постигла оно што треба да постигне. Какво је ваше мишљење о томе? Да ли Црква треба да улаже више ресурса у то како надгледа ова питања?<br/><br/>Тренутно имамо 16 чланова са свих континената и главних језичких група. Ми представљамо различите дисциплине и професије, а сврха комисије - као и статута који су управо проглашени државом - је да пружи савет Светом Оцу.<br/><br/>Уобичајени неспоразум о комисији је да се прво бавимо случајевима оптужби. То није случај. Немамо правну или административну моћ у погледу случајева, јер када су у питању оптужбе за злоупотребу, утврђени су судови и поступак.<br/><br/>Други неспоразум је да директно промовишемо ствари на терену. Наш први и најважнији циљ је да саветујемо Светог Оца о питањима.<br/><br/>Дакле, са моје тачке гледишта, да, морамо да инвестирамо више. Али морамо да инвестирамо више на локалном нивоу, и морамо да се побринемо да предлози Папске комисије буду прослеђени Светом Оцу – што обично ради председник – а затим постоји процес праћења који одражава оно што смо дали као наш савет.<br/><br/>У Аустралији, Catholic Professional Standards Limited надгледа одговор Цркве и пружа смернице и подршку како би се осигурало да све институције у Цркви буду сигурне институције за децу. Да ли је потребна нека врста организационе подршке Рима оним епископима и епархијама које се боре да формирају ове институције и обезбеде заштиту у тим епархијама?<br/><br/>Мислим да ће се на крају комисија развити у том правцу. Они су сада у процесу запошљавања стручњака у тим областима.<br/><br/>Мислим да Црква треба да схвати да локалне цркве могу да уче једни од других. И моје разумевање је увек било - и мислим да нас је Свети Отац подсетио - да Црква неће функционисати као централизовано друштво. То не функционише тако ефикасно. Сваки епископ, свака епископска конференција, има, у извесној мери, свој живот. Оно што треба да научимо више је да отворимо канале међусобне комуникације.<br/><br/>Постоји велики број ствари које људи криве за злостављање у Цркви. Као свештеник и психолог, и као неко ко се састао и радио са преживелима, шта мислите о том питању?<br/><br/>Мислим да је питање одакле долази злостављање најважније, и папа се обратио томе у свом писму Божјем народу објављеном 20. августа. Он каже у првом параграфу, и понавља то изнова и изнова, да је питање сексуалног злостављања увек повезано – или скоро увек повезано – не само са питањем злоупотребе власти, већ и са злоупотребом савести.<br/><br/>Дакле, право фундаментално питање злостављања је много сложеније него само [питање] сексуалности - било да је то хетеросексуално или хомосексуално. То је питање моћи, и ту заиста морамо да радимо на питању како разумемо свештенство, како разумемо епископство, како разумемо и живимо наше службе? Које су границе?<br/><br/>Зато ми је драго што језуитска провинција у Аустралији успоставља кодекс понашања, јер не говоримо само о сексуалном злостављању малолетника. Говоримо о сексуалном злостављању одраслих, и говоримо о злостављању на друге начине - као што је злоупотреба савести, где диктирате некоме шта мислите, или се претварате да знате од Бога, и можете рећи другој особи, "Морате то учинити", против савести те особе.<br/><br/>Многи људи мисле да целибат производи злоупотребу. Као што увек кажем, целибат као такав није разлог за злоупотребу – иначе, како ћемо објаснити да 99,9 одсто свих злостављача не живи у целибату, и како ћемо објаснити да 95 или 96 одсто свих свештеника не злоставља малолетнике? Али, целибат, или завет чедности, који није баш интегрисан, који се не живи како треба - да, то ствара проблем. Понекад људи узимају на пиће, понекад узимају на коцкање, а понекад узимају на сексуално злостављање, са одраслима и са малолетницима.<br/><br/>Право питање у вези са тим је како се носити са појмом религиозне духовне моћи у коју су уложени свештеници и епископи? Како нам теологија може помоћи да разумемо, а можда и како нам социологија, психологија или пословна администрација могу помоћи да дефинишемо границе моћи и неопходност одржавања својих граница? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Нисам изненађен овим неслагањем. У ствари, чак бих ишао толико далеко да кажем да ово није нешто што ће се икада променити, нити би требало да се сви узнемиримо због промене. За 10 година, и даље ћемо имати крваву ивицу, сложене ставке на листи највећих забринутости, а ствари које коначно долазимо до разумевања ће бити главни дијелови наше потрошње.<br/><br/>Сада, Гуннар и Анди имају одличне поене, посебно о ИТ тимовима који виде ИТ проблеме и решавају их са ИТ решењима; у ствари, уверен сам да њихови поени имају заслуге.<br/><br/>Али мислим да постоје и друге идеје које их надмашују (коментарисао сам на њиховим блоговима о томе, а касније сам одлучио да би требало да блогујем овде). Ове врхунске забринутости су крваво нове такве да:<br/><br/>Бојимо се нових ствари зато што их не разумемо, или их не разумемо зато што су нове.<br/><br/>Они су сувише нови да бисмо имали чврсте приступе руковању њима.<br/><br/>они су сувише нови да бисмо знали да ли треба да будемо забринути или не! имамо тенденцију да се подразумевано параноичан / забринут, што је добро!<br/><br/>сувише нови да имају очигледне буџетске ставке додељене њима. Могу ли купити кутију или неки софтвер који пружају "облак безбедност" или "безбедност друштвених медија"?<br/><br/>они су толико нови посао не знају ни како да их користе или шта желе од њих. Да не говоримо о томе како их можемо осигурати док још испуњавамо или барем не газимо све пословне потребе. Ако компанија још увек не зна како да их користи, нисам сигуран да је безбедност у било којој позицији да безбедно води ту употребу.<br/><br/>Такође треба напоменути да се ове нове ствари у великој мјери гурају преко потрошачке земље иу посао, са ИТ-ом као неком врстом "Ох да", мислио. Фиреваллови, АВ, АМ, Аутх су сви ИТ одговори на типична ИТ питања. Наравно, ту постоји разлика. Они су такође веома субјективна питања, за разлику од веома објективних ставки као што су заштитни зидови, познати злонамерни битови, понашања, потписи, портови. Посао представља веома сложена питања која често укључују људе (које не можемо закрпити) и која се често не уклапају у правила. Чак и ако смо се окренули од техничких решења и посветили своје време решавању ових проблема, они и даље неће бити уредно ријешени. Исто тако, када дође до гурања, можете ли имати и испунити циљеве са заштитним зидовима? Можете ли показати побољшање? Све ово произилази из прилично субјективног нетехничког аспекта тих питања. Сорта разлике између картице извештаја детета и повратних информација које добијате од конференције родитеља и наставника. Ако имате дете, са којим бисте били најсклонији да се не слажете или да не морате да верујете? (Одговор је субјективан!)<br/><br/>Могло би се рећи да је ово природни напредак сигурности и технологије: од подршке техничким контролама до кретања према понашању и људима. Наравно, ове 3 главне забринутости могу се рећи да ударају кроз заштитне зидове и мрежне сегменте, али то је природа тих ствари (друштвени медији "пробијање" кроз заштитни зид је далеко другачији од мене пробијање кроз ССХ везу да премостим своју кућну мрежу; друштвени медији су слични начину * Користим моју ССХ везу након што је већ ударио јер је потребно; т.<br/><br/>У суштини, све индикације указују на то да нас ова дихотомија не изненађује. И не мислим да је ово нека додатна индикација да ИТ / сигурност то ради погрешно, или није правилно усклађена са пословањем, или има техничку позадину тамне серверске собе. Не кажем да радимо ствари исправно или да смо правилно усклађени, али горе наведено није добар аргумент за подршку теорији тих недостатака.<br/><br/>Сада за заиста велики скок. Волео бих да тренутни пораст у мобилном рачунарству буде велики као увођење рачунара у посао, а касније и рачунара / интернета у посао. Сада, нисам био у близини када се први догодио, нити сам био у индустрији када је револуција личног рачунара ушла у посао, али кладим се да је то најближе поређење до сада. Могу чак рећи исто за друштвене медије. Ово су проклети нови и то су велике промене изван само доношења Мац-а или новог софтвера или неког новог пословног процеса. |
