In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Онлине ЦПР сертификација Блог<br/><br/>Датум: 23. јул 2014.<br/><br/>Аутосомна доминантна интерстицијска болест бубрега је ретка колекција болести које утичу на познате функције бубрега.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Хобсов против Локовог рачуна о стању природе<br/><br/>Тема: ФилозофијаРечи: 2539Странице: 9август 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Хобс и Лок су међу најутицајнијим политичким филозофима који су икада писали на енглеском језику. Стање природе, које претходи организацији сложених друштава, је заједничка претпоставка да и Хобс и Лок деле, али интерпретирају на различите начине. Бивши сматра да су људи у свом природном стању једнако опасни и слободни да остварују своје себичне циљеве, неограничени непостојећим појмовима правде, због чега се његово природно стање своди на „рат сваког човека против сваког човека“ (Хобс76). Ово друго, с друге стране, види људе у њиховом првобитном стању као једнако вредне и ограничава природну слободу идејом правде која захтева да се не наноси штета другима, што омогућава дефинисање стања природе као "узајамне помоћи и очувања" уместо рата (Локке 15). Кључна разлика између рачуна два филозофа о природном стању је да Лок користи етичка разматрања, док Хобс не, и на крају доводи Хобса да замисли државу која има неограничену моћ над људским бићима, док Лок ограничава владу моралним принципима, које сматра природним законом.<br/><br/>Хобс заснива своје претпоставке о стању природе на чињеници да су сви људи отприлике једнаки у својим физичким и менталним способностима. Он признаје да неки појединци могу показати већу физичку снагу или супериорни интелект, али инсистира да "када се све рачуна заједно, разлика између човека и човека није толико значајна" (Хобс 74). Пошто су људи отприлике једнаки у својим способностима, они такође имају сличне наде да постигну своје циљеве и задовоље своје потребе (Хобс 75). Као логичан исход ове једнакости, када људи почну да се такмиче за оскудне ресурсе, нико се не може осећати потпуно сигурним у својој имовини. Чак и ако моћна, лукава и способна особа успе да покори „особе свих људи које може“, она још увек не гарантује крајњу сигурност (Хобс 75). Пошто ниједан човек не може постићи такву супериорност над другима која га чини потпуно имуним на њихову снагу интелекта, ниједан човек се не може осећати потпуно сигурним када је окружен својим једнакима. Хобсова једнакост у природном стању је једнакост страха, где сви људи виде једни друге као опасне конкуренте.<br/><br/>Баш као и Хобс, Лоцке сматра да су сва људска бића фундаментално једнака, али додељује веома различито значење термину. Из његове перспективе, то није једнакост способности, већ, пре, једнакост вредности. Он сматра да би људи "промискуитетно рођени од свих истих предности природе" логично требало да уживају савршену једнакост међу њима, јер нема разлога да се неко сматра инхерентно вреднијим (Локке 8). Једина могућа основа за одређивање неких људи као супериорних над другима била би ако би Бог „јавним исказивањем своје воље поставио једног изнад другог“ (Локк 8). Пошто такво божанско санкционисање супериорности одсуствује, Лок закључује да се природна једнакост свих представника човечанства не може довести у питање. Хобс приступа једнакости прагматично и наглашава да су људи у њиховом природном стању једнако опасни, али Лок користи етички приступ и наглашава да су људи једнако вредни у Божијим очима. Ово неслагање је само прва разлика између два аутора на основу чињенице да Лок укључује Бога као премису у својој политичкој филозофији, док Хобс не.<br/><br/>Још једна карактеристична карактеристика Хобсовог приказа природног стања је његова интерпретација слободе. Према Хобсу, стање природе подразумева неограничену слободу да ради све што је потребно за наставак постојања. Филозоф дефинише слободу као "одсуство спољашњих препрека" у коришћењу својих способности за постизање својих циљева (Хобс 79). Примарна сврха сваког осјећајног бића је одржавање његовог континуираног постојања. Као последица тога, Хобсова слобода се своди на несметану прилику да се уради било шта што би, по сопственом мишљењу, било најпогодније за очување живота и имовине (Хобс 79). Једино ограничење слободе јесте да особа не може учинити ништа противречно одржавању свог живота или уништавању "средстава за очување истог" (Хобс 79). Осим тога, не постоје границе, и свако има "право на све, чак и на тело другог" ако то унапређује нечији опстанак (Хобс 80). Дакле, природна слобода, као што је видио Хобс, је одсуство споља наметнутих препрека у остваривању права на све како би се одржала и осигурала нечија континуирана егзистенција.<br/><br/>Лок такође подржава идеју природне слободе, али, не изненађује, приступа јој на начин који се значајно разликује од Хобсовог. Чим почне да расправља о слободи у стању природе, он одмах примећује да стање слободе не изједначава "стање лиценце" (Лоцке 9). Филозоф идентификује два специфична ограничења људске слободе у стању природе. Први је идентичан Хобсовом уводу: колико год да је слободан и независан, особа ипак "нема слободу да се уништи" (Локе 9). Ипак, друго ограничење директно противречи Хобсовим предлозима. Према Локу, свако људско биће има природну обавезу да "не повреди другог у свом животу, здрављу, слободи или имовини" (9). Баш као и његова интерпретација једнакости, аутор заснива ову тврдњу на етичким и верским основама: људи треба да чувају постојање једни других, јер су сви они креације истог "свемоћног и бесконачно мудрог творца" (Локке 9). Према томе, Локова слобода у природном стању ограничава много строже од Хобса увођењем обавезе да се уздржи од наношења штете и себи и другима.<br/><br/>Разлике између ова два аутора се такође манифестују у њиховим рачунима о правди у природном стању човечанства. Што се тиче Хобса, разграничавање праведних и неправедних пракси је само ствар закона. У природном стању не постоји судска пракса, а једини закон који управља људским бићима у њиховом првобитном стању је природни закон који их само обавезује да траже личну сигурност. Као резултат тога, ништа не може бити неправедно у првобитном стању човечанства: „појмови исправне и погрешне правде и неправде“ немају места и значења у одсуству строго примењеног закона (Хобс 78). Све док људи користе своју практично неограничену слободу да се немилосрдно такмиче једни са другима за ресурсе, на које имају једнако право, они немају критеријуме за разлику између праведних и неправедних поступака. Стога, Хобсово стање природе пркоси самој идеји правде, јер је аутор тумачи као пуку функцију формализованог и утврђеног закона.<br/><br/>Лок приписује различито значење правди и види је не толико у законодавном, колико у етичком смислу. Овај рад је већ споменуо да, за разлику од Хобса, Лок користи етичке појмове и генерално заснива своју политичку филозофију на моралним, а не чисто практичним претпоставкама. Лоцкеов природни закон, за разлику од Хоббесовог, обавезује људска бића да се брину једни о другима, а не да једноставно остављају све да се брину о себи. Као резултат тога, у његовом природном стању постоји место за правду и неправду. Сам аутор указује на ову чињеницу, напомињући да нико не треба да лишава другог свог живота средстава за његово очување "осим ако се ради о правди над преступником" (Локке 9). Ова изјава открива са највећом јасноћом да, према Локу, постоји правда у стању природе, и, штавише, људи морају да је активно сачувају. Критеријум правде, који недостаје Хобсовом природном стању, је друго ограничење природне слободе које је наметнуо Лок: акција је неправедна ако представља неоправдану претњу животу и имовини друге особе.<br/><br/>Ове разлике у третирању једнакости, слободе и правде или неправде два аутора кулминирају у њиховој интерпретацији односа између стања природе и стања рата. Из Хобсове перспективе, ова два су синоними, јер је немилосрдна конкуренција једини логичан исход стављања људи са еквивалентним способностима и сличним потребама у окружење са ограниченим ресурсима. Он отворено наводи ову везу: "ако двојица људи желе исту ствар, коју ипак не могу обоје уживати, они постају непријатељи" и стога су у стању рата једни са другима (Хобс 75). Ипак, пошто су људи бројни и сви поседују сличне способности и потребе, ова конкуренција се манифестује не само у индивидуалним интеракцијама, већ и на нивоу човечанства у целини. Све док сви људи имају једнака и неограничена права на све ресурсе, па чак и на тела и животе једни других, стање природе је рат "сваког човека против сваког човека" (Хобс 76). Ова мрачна интерпретација произилази директно из Хобсовог приказивања природног стања које је регулисано искључиво егоистичким нагонима појединаца.<br/><br/>Лок, с друге стране, прави разлику између стања природе и стања рата и истиче да, иако се могу појавити истовремено, није разлог да се идентификујемо једни са другима. Локова дефиниција ратног стања је практично идентична оној коју је понудио Хобс. Према Локу, "онај ко покушава да доведе другог човека у његову апсолутну моћ, тиме се ставља у стање рата са њим" (14). Ово објашњење се савршено поклапа са Хобсовим појмом да универзално право свакога на све, укључујући и тела и животе других људи, доводи до стања рата. Ипак, Лок одбија да изједначи стање рата и стање природе управо зато што негира Хобсово тумачење природне слободе. Пошто Локово природно стање спречава људе да наносе штету једни другима кроз друго ограничење слободе, покушај напада на слободу друге особе је прекршај против природног закона. Док је за Хобса рат подразумевано стање човечанства, Лок га приказује као перверзију стања природе, а не као њену владавину.<br/><br/>Ове разлике у разграничењу државе о природи и њеним саставницима, као што су слобода, једнакост, правда и рат, отварају пут ауторима који су у супротности са приказима власти. На основу своје песимистичке процене природног стања, аутор Левијатана закључује да, у условима рата, не може бити дефинитивне наде за "живот времена које природа обично дозвољава људима да живе" (Хобс 80). Решење је утврђивање универзалног права на све и остављајући свима "толико слободе против других људи, колико би он дозволио другим људима против себе" (Хобс 80). Учесници насталог друштвеног уговора улажу неограничене слободе које су се предали у суверена – носиоца врховне власти чија је сврха очување оствареног статуса кво кажњавањем свих прекршаја против њега. Власт суверена је апсолутна: владар има овлашћење да „ради шта год сматра потребним“ да промовише мир међу својим поданицима, како нико не би напао живот или имовину другог. Хобс закључује да без такве непоколебљиве фигуре која има право да учини било шта субјектима, не може бити мира и никакве гаранције сигурности.<br/><br/>Иако се Лок слаже са потребом стварања политички организованих друштава, он се ипак супротставља Хобсовој идеји о сувереној моћи као неограниченој и непобедивој. Као што је горе поменуто, Локово природно стање није ни близу тако страшно као оно које је насликао Хобс због обавезе људи да сачувају не само себе, већ и једни друге. Дакле, потреба за друштвеним уговором не настаје из страха од других, већ из чисте погодности. Малим заједницама можда нису потребни бројни закони за рјешавање сукоба и "службеници за надгледање процеса", али већа удружења сматрају да је препоручљиво успоставити владе у ту сврху (Лоцке 57). Ипак, моћ владе не може бити неограничена јер би резултирала потчињавањем субјеката "несталној, неизвесној, непознатој, произвољној вољи другог човека" (Локке 17). Таква влада би представљала двоструко кршење природног закона. Пристанком на апсолутну власт друге особе над својим животом, субјект би прекршио своје прво ограничење забрањујући да се повреди. Што се тиче владара, уништавање слободе друге особе представљало би директну штету и, као такво, било би у супротности са другим ограничењем.<br/><br/>Као директан наставак његовог случаја за неограничену државну власт, Хобс негира поделу власти као принцип. Са његове тачке гледишта, суверен, једном успостављен, поседује „целокупну моћ прописивања правила“ која управља животима субјеката или, у краћем смислу, законодавну моћ (Хобс 114). Суверен такође задржава право да „саслуша и реши све контроверзе“ – то јест, судску власт (Хобс 114). Коначно, пошто је цела сврха суверена да примора субјекте да се уздрже од наношења штете једни другима, не може бити сумње да је извршна власт такође његова или њена ексклузивна прерогатива. Раздвајање моћи као концепт је страно Хобсу због његових погледа на стање природе. Стварање политичког ентитета у којем би извршна, законодавна и судска грана контролисале једни друге – односно такмичиле се – значило би поновно стварање Хобсовог стања природе као рата на вишем нивоу. Пошто људи улазе у друштвени уговор и успостављају владу како би стање природе ставили иза себе, а не да га поново успостављају у другачијем облику, Хобсово раздвајање власти директно је контрадикторно.<br/><br/>Лок, с друге стране, прихвата поделу власти као темељни принцип своје политичке теорије. Његов случај за одвајање је очигледан у дискусији о границама законодавне моћи. Као што Лок каже, тешко да би било препоручљиво „да исте особе, које имају моћ да доносе законе, имају у својим рукама и моћ да их извршавају“ (76). Филозоф упућује на несавршености људске природе и инхерентну жељу да се „узме у власт“ као образложење за ову меру предострожности (Locke 76). Као и у Хобсовом случају, Локов рачун о раздвајању моћи произилази директно из његове интерпретације природног стања. Ако већ постоји правда у природном стању и народ је може разумети, свака влада неизбежно подлеже истом природном закону. Пошто апсолутна власт над људима крши оба ограничења овог закона, препоручљиво је одвајање и дистрибуција како би влада функционисала на одговарајући начин.<br/><br/>Овај рад је показао да, иако су разлике између Хобсовог и Локовог рачуна о природном стању човечанства бројне, оне на крају представљају присуство одсуства моралних претпоставки. Хобс посматра природно стање као стање неограничене слободе, где се људи обдарени једнаким способностима и невезани било каквим моралним појмовима, као што је правда, непрестано такмиче за ресурсе. Лок, међутим, тумачи једнакост и слободу етички, а не практично, и сматра да је рат перверзија природног стања, јер природни закон обавезује људе да не наносе штету једни другима. Хобс инсистира на свемоћном владару, јер, у одсуству етичких ограничења, ниједан други ауторитет не би могао присилити људе да се уздрже од наношења штете једни другима. Ипак, по Локовом мишљењу, давање неограничених овлашћења влади би било у супротности са етичким ограничењима уграђеним у закон природе, због чега се он, за разлику од Хобса, залаже за поделу власти. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Модна полиција: Шта је Игра престола повраћала<br/><br/>Канадско-француски певач Абас Хасан ставио је заслепљујући напор да заслепи цело човечанство на Фасхион Параде 2014.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Одређивање хидрауличких својстава земљишта са различитим течностима за влажење : Теза поднета у делимичном испуњењу услова за магистарске студије на Универзитету Линколн<br/><br/>Апстракт<br/><br/>Хидраулична својства земљишта као што су хидраулична проводљивост, задржавање воде и односи биљних вода доминирају процесима кретања воде. На пример, инфилтрација, испаравање и проток воде унутар земљишта. Као широко распрострањена појава у земљишту, одбојност воде у земљишту мења хидрауличке функције земљишта тако што се одупире протоку воде у земљиште. Штавише, хидраулична својства не зависе само од поре система тла, већ и на њих утичу физичко-хемијске особине површине поре. У поређењу са водом, етанол није под утицајем водоотпорности због ниже површинске напетости. Сврха употребе етанола је елиминисање ефекта одбојности воде у земљишту на мерења хидрауличних својстава. Међутим, примена чистог етанола у природном земљишту може деградирати органске материјале земљишта и довести до промена у физичким својствима. Стога, водени раствори етанола могу бити алтернативна опција. Ипак, изводљивост коришћења воденог етанола за одређивање криве задржавања течности у земљишту остаје непозната. Ова студија има за циљ да тестира изводљивост водених раствора етанола (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % и 100 % в/в) за утврђивање криве задржавања течности под малим опсегом примењеног притиска у узорцима грубог песка са различитом влажношћу и органски модификованим природним земљиштем. Резултат је показао да је десорпција тестирања водених раствора етанола у поређењу са водом била бржа за отприлике 1 до 3x на основу садржаја течности при истом примењеном притиску и времена за постизање сваке равнотеже. Резултати експеримента са песком сугеришу да када је концентрација воденог раствора етанола била испод 50%, губици од испаравања били су мањи од 1%, а релативна разлика између тестирања течности и воде била је мања од 10%. Међутим, губици испаравања су били 11,06% и 24,6%, а релативне разлике су биле око 15% и 30% у 50% и 100% раствору етанола, респективно. Насупрот томе, органске измене у Темплетоновој муљној глини не само да су повећале способност задржавања воде, већ су и смањиле губитке испаравања. Губици испаравања у ТСЛ земљишту и ТСЛ земљишту са органским модификацијама били су са 1% у растворима са садржајем етанола мањим од 50%. Губици испаравања од 50% и 100% етанола били су 2,8% и 2,9%, респективно. Релативне разлике између воде и тестирања течности биле су сличне експерименту са песком када су концентрације тестирања течности биле испод 50%. Међутим, релативне разлике у 50% и 100% раствору етанола биле су мање него у узорку песка са око 10% и 15%, респективно. Поред тога, анализа релативне разлике сугерише да скоро сви водени раствори етанола имају нижи волуметријски садржај течности при истом испорученом притиску у поређењу са водом, што је одраз водених раствора етанола који се десорбују брже од воде под еквивалентним притиском. Стога, 10% до 40% раствора етанола може се сматрати алтернативом за одређивање хидрауличких својстава земљишта због њихове брже стопе десорпције и не утиче на одбојност воде у земљишту. Због испаравања и растварања органског материјала, водени раствори етанола изнад 50% концентрације нису били погодни за груби песак или земљиште средње текстуре. |

| Want to plant tomatoes in June or July along the Southern California Coast but not sure the seasonal timing is right? Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around September 3. The state of California is so large that some of its areas are divided into multiple U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones. Otherwise, you will want to plant tomatoes in the spring, as a crop that matures in late summer to early fall. There is a multitude of varieties, filling out the entire spectrum of color, size, and flavor. Anyway, it's important to remember that the numbers in this fall planting guide are only a starting point for you! But with all the weather weirdness happening in Southern California right now, one has to wonder if it's safe to start tomatoes this month as opposed to early spring. Before planting tomatoes, amend the soil with a mushroom compost or mycorrhizal fertilizer. From seed or transplant, follow these steps for successful tomatoes this season. ZONE 7. Look at this load of tomato beauties! by Farmers' Almanac Staff Updated: November 20, 2020 Home & Garden, Planting Guides. It takes a lot of water (and heating energy) to peel three million pounds of processing toma toes in California each year. California, that time changes if planting that vegetable in northern California. The days are bright and warm enough, and if you're starting tomatoes from seed, you can get a jump-start on the season by planting earlier and harvesting earlier. These problems that plague tomatoes grown in containers can magnify in tropical or subtropical climates, where the humidity is turned up and pests multiply. If you are in Zone 10 (parts of Hawaii, southern California and southern Florida), you can plant tomatoes late as a fall crop. All of the following pertains to full-size tomatoes. Oregon's Rogue River Valley, California's High Foothills Growing season: May to early Oct. Summers are hot and dry; typical winter lows run from 23 degrees to 9 degrees F/-5 degrees to -13 degrees C. The summer-winter contrast suits plants that need dry, hot summers and moist, only moderately cold winters. In the U.S. we ripen them by putting them in a sunny east or west window. Tomatoes can be found in nearly every vegetable garden across the country, and with good reason, as little else compares to the flavor of a home-grown tomato. Remove tomato plant from the nursery pot (even if it is a peat pot). Until fairly recently, this favorite fruit was either imported from growers in Mexico or produced as greenhouse tomatoes in California or Arizona. Beans (Zones 3-10): There are two main kinds of beans found in gardens, bush beans and pole beans. The same tips and methods can be applied to late tomato planting in many hot-summer areas. One of the most helpful but often ignored tips in growing tomatoes is not to plant your tomatoes in the garden too early, waiting until all danger of frost has passed (usually in to May). When to Plant Tomatoes in Sacramento Valley. Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around August 1. Transplants can be set into the ground beginning in about April, but tomatoes are warm weather plants, so planting when the weather is warmer is usually better. Suggested varieties: California Wonder, ... It's still not too late to plant tomatoes and peppers from seeds as well. The mycorrhizal fungi assist with water and nutrient absorption by the plant and reduce plant stress. Northern California and the north coast: Growing tomatoes in a greenhouse isn't for the faint of heart; they require specific greenhouse tomato plant care entirely different from other crops. ZONE 8. Month By Month Planting Guide for Southern California: A 'Cheat Sheet' These generalizations are for The Learning Garden, located in Sunset Zone 24, less than 3 miles from the Pacific Ocean in an alluvial plain that is just above sea level. Good luck and good gardening to you. Having grown tomatoes in Southern California since 1979, I had the following intuitive answers from my experience. If you're interested in trying your hand, read on to learn how to grow tomatoes in a greenhouse. Good luck and good gardening to you. Water Soil Consistently . For more information and to find your zone, you can check out the USDA Zone Hardiness Map here. Tomatoes are not hard to grow; they're incredibly productive, versatile in the kitchen, and so delicious off the vine. Southern California Growing Seasons. The Sacramento Valley of California has long, hot dry summers, making it a good environment for growing some varieties of tomatoes… Be sure to check your gardening zone for last frost dates. When to Plant Tomatoes in Zone 8b?. Our guide covers all the information you need to grow tomatoes successfully—including selecting tomato varieties, starting seeds, transplanting tomatoes outside, using tomato stakes and cages, and tomato plant care. Once the plant has reach about 18" (45cm) high it … The roots decompose in the soil and ultimately become nutrients for future vegetables. Only the really immature ones were lost that way. And that is saying a lot, because we certainly grow quite a few delicious heirloom tomato varieties. The Spruce / K. Dave Because containers can dry out quickly, achieving success growing tomatoes in containers depends on maintaining consistent moisture. Choose the varieties wisely.
