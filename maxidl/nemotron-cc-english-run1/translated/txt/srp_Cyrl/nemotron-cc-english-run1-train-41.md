| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Бакопа<br/><br/>19 новембар 2015<br/>Објавио Doxiderol<br/><br/>Бацопа је вишегодишња биљка која напредује у мочварним суптропским и тропским регионима широм света. Високо цењена биљка је кључни састојак у Докидерол, додатак исхрани који побољшава когнитивну функцију. Бакопа је изабрана због своје способности да заштити мозак и повећа ацетилхолин, биохемијски гласник који омогућава нервном систему да преноси информације.<br/><br/>Ајурведски практичари су први описали терапеутска својства бакопе у 300. пне. Лекари су забележили способности бакопе да побољшају интелигенцију и памћење. Скоро 2.500 година касније, растуће тело савремених истраживања потврђује когнитивне предности бакопе забележене у ајурведском тексту.<br/><br/>Године 1987. истраживачи у Индији процијенили су ефекте бакопе на интелектуалну функцију дјеце школског узраста. Током четворонедељне студије примијенили су бакопу на 40 дјеце која су имала 6 до 8 година. Научници су утврдили да бацопа повећала перцепцију и памћење. Деца су била у стању да брже и прецизније реши лавиринт вежбе након пријема бацопа. Многи родитељи у Индији рутински користе бакопу како би побољшали интелектуални развој своје дјеце.<br/><br/>Студија од 12 недеља објављена у августу 2001. године издању Психофармакологије истраживала је ефекте бацопе на когнитивне функције. Научници су насумично доделили здравим волонтерима, узраста од 18 до 65 година, да примају бацопу или неактивну супстанцу. Они су такође користили двоструко слепу конфигурацију за студију како би сакрили идентитете производа. Истраживачи користе овај дизајн како би осигурали да су резултати теста валидни јер елиминише пристрасност истраживача и учесника. Бацопа група је доживела значајно побољшање у брзини којом су могли да обрађују визуелне информације. Учесници су такође брже научили и ефикасније складиштили нова сећања.<br/><br/>У 2007. години, лабораторијска студија Тексас А & М Цоллеге оф Медицине открила је један од механизама одговорних за способност бацопе да промовише здравље мозга. Према научницима, бакопа користи полифеноле како би спречила оксидативни стрес и штету коју узрокује здравим можданим ћелијама. Бакопа такође смањује штетне депозите супстанце познате као бета-амилоид, која је примарна компонента плака у мозгу пацијената са Алцхајмеровом болешћу.<br/><br/>Двоструко слепа студија објављена у јулу 2008. године у часопису за алтернативну и комплементарну медицину проценила је ефекат бакопе на старије пацијенте. Студија је потврдила да је бакопа повећала когнитивне перформансе уз смањење стреса. Према ауторима, користи постигнуте у овој студији потврдиле су резултате ранијих истраживања.<br/><br/>90-дневна студија објављена у децембарском броју Фитотерапија истраживања 2008. године потврђује когнитивне користи које су претходно демонстриране у другим бацопа студијама. Бацопа је значајно побољшала способност учесника да привремено чувају и користе информације потребне за завршетак сложеног задатка. Двоструко слепа студија је такође показала да бацопа смањује време потребно за обраду визуелних информација.<br/><br/>Поред побољшања преноса нервних сигнала, научници претпостављају да бакопа повећава когнитивну функцију смањењем анксиозности. Бројне студије указују на то да анксиозност омета способност обављања задатака који захтевају когнитивне функције вишег нивоа, као што су учење и памћење. Стрес омета биохемијске гласнике и здрав пренос нервног сигнала. Бацопа ублажава стрес и враћа осећај смирености повећањем нивоа ацетилхолина, што смањује откуцаје срца и омогућава вам да дубље удахнете.<br/><br/>Доксидерол је одличан начин да добијете предности бакопе. Овај холистички додатак такође садржи друге природне састојке који промовишу здравље мозга и подржавају вашу способност да се фокусирате и концентришете на сложен задатак, као и да запамтите информације. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Она такође може да осети демонске ауре, као и зле ауре. Међутим, када је рођена и одрастала, њене моћи су биле запечаћене и била је много мање моћна. Од пораза оне која је запечаћивала њене моћи, Кагоме је достигла свој пуни потенцијал.<br/><br/>ОЧИШЋЕЊЕ Успостављајући физичку везу, Кагоме има способност да очисти и отров и таму од субјекта (живог и неживог). Да би то учинила, она пројектује своје духовне моћи кроз своју руку.<br/><br/>ДУХОВНЕ баријере Са својим пуним потенцијалом, Кагоме има способност да створи баријеру око себе и прошири га око других. То је баријера у облику куполе која може уништити слабе демоне који ступају у контакт са баријером.<br/><br/>ПОБОЉШАНО ОЧИЈЕ<br/>Кагоме има способност да види ствари које су често невидљиве људском оку: духове, духове, божанске и зле ауре.<br/><br/>СПОСОБНОСТИ СА ОРУЖЊЕМ<br/>Кагоме има способност да користи лук и стрелу. Она је била самостално обучена, а након година праксе, њена стрела ретко пропушта свој знак. Поред тога, Кагоме има способност да улије своје стреле са моћима. Она може да унесе стреле са својим духовним моћима који им омогућава да продру демонске силе, уништавају чаролије, и прочишћавају објекте. Она може да унесе свој лук са својим моћима и одбијају непријатељске нападе. Она има способност да унесе своје стреле са прочишћавајућом енергијом да прочисти отров, као и моћне, дуго удаљене демонске нападе. И на крају, она има способност да заобиђе друге са својом стрелицом: Ако се деси да је њена мета иза баријере или таоца, стрелица може да се телепортује и погоди само своју мету.<br/><br/>Остале њене способности су постале прилично неважне јер су повезане са путовањем кроз време (кроз Бунар за кости), Шиконским драгуљем или њеном претходном инкарнацијом.<br/><br/>канон<br/><br/>Кагоме је повучена неколико дана након дипломирања у средњој школи, међутим, пре него што се Бунар за кости поново отворио како би јој омогућио да се трајно врати у прошлост.<br/><br/>слободан стил<br/><br/>сећања<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Звук њеног имена био је мекани шапат у позадини њеног ума, као позив пригушен ветром. То је био звук далеког сећања, глас који је почела да заборавља, али очајнички држећи се све исто. Био је то глас њене мајке, уврнут у тугу њене изгубљене ћерке. На крају крајева, Кагоме је протерана без трага. Живо се сећала тих тренутака, начина на који је дан почео, онога што је имала за доручак и последње што је рекла мајци. Било је прогони, та сећања, јер је било као и сваки други пут када је склизнула између светова. Пробудила се, безнадежна, јер није имала сврху изван школе. Могла је да нађе посао, а тог дана је била заказана за интервју. Њено срце није било у њему, али је то било оно што је требало да уради.<br/><br/>Сетила се осећаја страха, усисавајући га и дајући себи говор да може то да уради. Да би могла да напредује у животу за који је сада требало да буде решена у прошлости. Наравно, имала је дуготрајан осећај да више не припада свом времену или свом животу. Не са свиме што је оставила иза себе.<br/><br/>Кагоме се сетила осећаја дрвета испод прстију, начина на који јој се рука увукла у дршку да би отворила врата. Сетила се да је паузирала, окрећући се мајци са светлим и живахним осмехом док се тресла од ступора. "Ја одлазим." Сетила се како је јак њен глас звучао, осмех на уснама њене мајке као њене очи сијала са поносом. Њена мајка је рекла збогом, што се није чинило другачијим него раније, али некако је тежина речи постала тежа на Кагоминим раменима што је више размишљала.<br/><br/>Укратко, мисли су трепереле напред, питајући се да ли је њена мајка забринута за њу, пропустила је као и она. Кагоме је могла отворено признати да је снага њене мајке, њена подршка чињеници да је њена ћерка тако често пролазила кроз време. Било је времена када је мислила да је слаба јер није имала жену на коју се ослањала.<br/><br/>Међутим, сећала се да је сакупљала оскудну количину снаге. Сећала се помака у ваздуху, температуре која се значајно разликује од онога што је очекивала, трептајући у изненадном и непознатом окружењу. И када се окренула да се врати, да се провуче кроз врата кроз која је прошла, наишла је на непознати и хладан метал испод прстију и унутрашњост која није била улаз у њену кућу. Човек је стајао испред ње, иза шалтера, који је гледао у њу очима широким као њене.<br/><br/>Она није паника, барем. Бити подељен кроз време и стављен у немогућим ситуацијама барем изградио своју снагу воље до чудних догађаја отишао. Зато што није сваки дан да је неко нашао себе повукао у прошлост од стране демона, намеравајући да ишчупа моћан драгуљ из свог тела за који нису ни знали да је тамо. А онда је постојала чињеница да је разбио рекао моћан драгуљ у ко зна колико комада и био је задатак да их пронађу. Такве ствари нису били нормални, а она је морала да се квадрат и ваљати са њим када је схватила да је њена стварност. Изгледало је тако једноставно, само сакупите комаде и поправите драгуљ.<br/><br/>Али није било лако, било је много демона после крхотина и самог драгуља. И један посебно моћан демон са жељом да је одлучан да види испуњен. До данашњег дана, она никада није научила његову жељу, али је знала да никада није била испуњена чак и када је завршио срушен ствар. Он је упропастио толико живота за ништа. Упропастио толико живота за такав узалудан задатак. Нараку је био најтежи непријатељ, и онај који је био центар свега што је пошло наопако у животу њеног пријатеља.<br/><br/>Али, то је била та непредвидљивост, та потреба да се ваља са оним што се догађа и вољом коју је стекла из своје авантуре коју је запамтила да извуче како би смислила причу која се уклапа у тренутак који се није чинио превише хировитим или далеко одузетим. Морала је да верује, морала је да преживи.<br/><br/>На крају крајева, она се суочила са горим од човека у продавници камера. Она је лагала кроз зубе да јој спаси живот пре.<br/><br/>"Тражио сам посао." На крају крајева, то није била потпуна лаж. На крају крајева, она је отишла из своје куће са намером да присуствује интервјуу за посао. Њено стање хаљине би барем потврдило толико. То је био један од лакших фибс које је икада рекла.<br/><br/>И из неког разлога, тај лудак ју је унајмио.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Кагомед се преврнула у кревету док је гурала удаљена сећања, одбијајући да призна да је заиста будна. У последњем трептају сна, молила је да се врати и да је врати у загрљај. Затворила је очи, спремна да заспи и била је упозната само са сећањима. Одјеци песме певали су у даљини њених сећања, песма која ју је често мучила, дајући јој исто име као и њој. Глас који је певао више није подсећао на њену мајку, већ на гласове деце са којом се често играла док је одрастала. Позвали су сећања, иако је прошло година од када је почела овај живот, иако је била срећна у овом животу, позив тих сећања био је прегласан.<br/><br/>Одједном, она је пала назад у њих и сан је избегла поново. Она је гледала себе у загрљају своје породице док је Инуиасха је повукао назад у бунар, гледајући као запрепашћен као што је осетила. Сећања на тај тренутак, та осећања, још увек су била тако јака. Осећај сломљеног срца и туге поново је избио, иако је било толико дуго откако се осећала као да је одузета од свега што јој је било важно.<br/><br/>Наравно, њена породица је била важна, и била је срећна што је поново у њиховим рукама. Никада није могла у потпуности, истински описати како се осећала у тим данима. Још увек није могла да објасни како се осећала подељена на два дела, са зараћеним жељама да буде и у прошлости и садашњости. Сећала се узалудних покушаја да скочи кроз бунар, прстима канџама на земљу у очајничкој молби да јој се врати. Првог месеца код куће, није спавала толико колико је плакала.<br/><br/>Елисион је украсила сличну реакцију, иако није била тако жестока јер није знала тачно где је прошла, нити је знала где би могла да се врати. Њена истраживања су била суптилна између рада на послу и покушаја да се смири у овом животу. Није имала намеру да остане, нема намеру да се задржи дуже него што јој је било потребно. И док се није трудила тако жестоко као када је покушавала да се врати у прошлост, њена страст је била десетострука јер није имала везе са овим светом, јер је била заиста сама... без икакве наде да ће доћи до ње.<br/><br/>У својим ирационалним тренуцима, мислила је да ју је Драгуљ повукао и пронашао нови пакао за њу да живи у. Нови пакао који би је присилио да зажели жељу, али се врло јасно сетила да је желела да је заувек нестао. То није зауставило њене снове, време када се пробудила у ноћи јецања, а та сећања на њену прошлост су била најтежа за суочавање, најтежа за заборав. Њено срце је почело да трчи у паници док се поново окренула у кревету, њен дах је постао борба док се борила против напада панике изазваног њеним лутајућим умом овако касно у ноћ.<br/><br/>Мрзела је да се осећа тако слабо, тако уплашено.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Кагоме се коначно повукла из кревета, њена соба је осветљена бледом светлошћу која је била довољна да је води у купатило. Стајала је испред огледала, судопер је трчао док је гледала у свој одраз. Гавран обојена коса покривала јој је лице и осећала се лоше као што је изгледала. Њено прво јутро у Елисиону било је слично овоме, само је била у лошијој форми.<br/><br/>Пронашла је место за спавање, успевајући да се договори са власником зграде како би јој омогућила да остане мало времена без плаћања. Можда је то био Мирокуов утицај који јој је омогућио да склопи такве договоре, јер је монах био познат по свом путу у шармантним (или преварантским) људима да им дају више него довољно за посао који су урадили. Монах је увек био такав, од када су се први пут срели. Он би тврдио да је стан господара прогоњен када то није било или, тврди да су били предмет напада када то не би било. Он би продао своје одељења и чари за тако високе цене. Радило је практично сваки пут и питала се зашто су људи били толико вољни да му верују.<br/><br/>Можда је то био његов осмех, или чињеница да је био монах да су људи из прошлости били толико вољни да се распадну. Он никада није ловио слабе, барем. Увек је чинио оно што је било исправно и био је симбол снаге за њу у временима када би гурнуо кроз све како би учинио оно што је било исправно. Гурао је кроз чињеницу да умире, да је проклет, и покушао је да уради нешто по том питању, а не да се ваља у својој судбини. Он се гурнуо до краја у времену које је довело до њихове последње борбе. И она је била срећна што су победили Нараку пре него што је могао постати предмет исте судбине као његов отац, и његов отац пре њега.<br/><br/>Што се тиче њених властитих чари, међутим, била је фер од свог пријатеља и направила је разуман договор. Сумњала је да би било ко на овом свету платио високу цену за егзорцизам или протеривање демона. Били су сувише технолошки напредни за то. Али она је била довољно паметна, и довољно паметна, да направи добар посао.<br/><br/>Али сада, Кагоме је била на бољем месту, иако јој је изглед на лицу био исти. Уклета, уморна, исцрпљена...<br/><br/>Брз поглед на сат на зиду јој је рекао да би могла покушати да спава дуже. Али она се одлучила од тога, не желећи да се поново суочи са ретроспективама. Уместо тога, туширала се, користећи хладну воду да би протерала своје демоне, да би напунила плућа оштрим удисањем даха и присилила се да се пробуди.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Није успело.<br/><br/>Не на начин на који је желела. Хладна вода је сигурно приморала ваздух у плућа, присилила је да се пробуди, а мишићи да се ухвате. Горки смех је извучен из њених усана док је нагињала главу уназад и нашла се да се више сећа. Данас, она није хтела да побегне од њих тако лако. Она није хтела да се опорави тако једноставно, да се опорави само зато што је хтела.<br/><br/>Понекад не можеш да избегнеш мисли које желиш, чак и када си био сигуран да си их прошао.<br/><br/>Санго би био од велике помоћи у овој ситуацији. Убица демона био је њен најбољи пријатељ, она би чак и ићи тако далеко да је зове сестру која никада није имала. Старија сестра која је била мудра, увек је имала своју страну када су се појавиле невоље. Посебно дечак невоља, када су такве ствари биле прилично тривијалне, али било је забавно имати симпатију и за њеног пријатеља да буде љут у њено име када је Инуиасха учинила тужном. На крају крајева, често је било да би полу-демон трчао на страну свог мртвог љубавника и сломио јој срце више пута.<br/><br/>Али, Санго ју је инспирисао и на друге начине. Након свега што се жена суочила, она је увек била тако јака, тако сигурна... Чак иу временима када је сумњала у себе, увек се извлачила. Дивила се да је имала способност да преживи након што је изгубила целу породицу - подсетник на то често је гурао Кагоме да преживи, јер је изгубила све на овом свету - а онда је њен брат постао пијун Нараку. Није било лако, није могло бити нешто са чиме би се било ко могао суочити и наставити даље. И даље се осмехнула, чак и са тим болом и тим подсетницима... Често је била тако светла, чак иу мрачнијим временима.<br/><br/>И сада је хтела да се нагне на страну старије жене, да се утеши у чињеници да је била тамо и да је подржавала. Осећала је да ће Санго некако проћи кроз ово и понудити неке речи снаге и разумевања. Била су времена попут ових која су погоршала ове чаролије, стални подсетник да је била без своје породице.<br/><br/>"Не желим да будем сама." Плакала је гласно у својој усамљености, звук туша утапања из молбе.<br/><br/>Није се плашила да то призна.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Још један сат је прошао пре него што је то схватила. Њена кожа је била хладна од воде и осећала се као да јој је лед пролазио кроз вене. Није схватила да је почела да дрхти док јој рука није дошла да искључи воду и заврши туш. Кагоме више није тражила свој поглед у огледалу, већ се умотала у пешкире и избацила из купатила, уз степенице и ушла у кухињу. Почела је да прави лагани доручак, неактивно читајући своје белешке за дан док је храна кувана.<br/><br/>Њена каријера је заиста почела ових последњих година. Њене фотографије су приказане у многим галеријама, њено име је почело да чести многе усне за оне који су заинтересовани за фотографију.<br/><br/>Посао који је тражила из хира изазвао је све. Била је много срећнија него што је очекивала да ће бити на овом свету. Никада није имала среће да се врати кроз пукотине у свој свет, али довољно срећна да добро ради. Када се вратила у пећ, сећала се времена које је коначно одустала од повратка кући. Било је око две године у њеном животу овде, јер је почела да се упушта у фотографију као више од хобија, али нешто што је могла направити име за себе.<br/><br/>Тај дан је био посебно пријатан, сунце је било високо на небу и нашла се како фотографише природни пејзаж. Мали дечак се сакрио у једној од биљака, а она је ухватила слику тренутка када се његово лице смирило у веселом, несташном осмеху у тренутку пре него што је скочио да застраши свој плен. То ју је подсетило на Схиппоу, мали Китсуне је, у суштини, усвојио. Он је, такође, био одвојен од своје породице када су се први пут срели. Његов отац је убио и био је одлучан да га освети. Док је био млад, изгледао је тако зрело у својим првим сусретима.<br/><br/>Можда је то био утицај Инуиасха који је омогућио комплету да се поново понаша као дете, да буде млад и хировит понекад док су други били зрелији. Понудио јој је утеху на свој начин, а она је покушала да се брине о њему као што би она била њена, иако је тада била тако млада. Међутим, њена младост је није спречила да схвати како да се брине о њему или да се брине о њему као о свом детету. Њено срце је отекло када се осмехнуо, када је био тако срећан због свог поклона бојица и одвојио време да направи уметност. Била је толико поносна на сваки цртеж који је завршио да је знала да ће се овако осјећати мајка у таквој ситуацији.<br/><br/>Бол који је прошао кроз њу био је превише, превише изненада. Недостајао јој је и желео је да види колико је порастао од када је отишла. Толико јој је недостајало ...<br/><br/>Да би се поштедела било каквог бола, било каквих лажних нада... одустала је и фокусирала се на побољшање себе.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Доручак је имао благи, досадни и инспирисани укус. Тек након што је завршила, схватила је да је заборавила на било какве зачине или укус хране. Било је прекасно да се сетим толико тога, јер је њен ум био превише заузет памћењем других детаља њеног живота који су очигледно постали важнији од њене хране.<br/><br/>"Седи!"<br/><br/>Наравно, ништа се није догодило када је љутито викала на једног посебно фрустрирајућег клијента који ју је подсећао на полу-демона. Био је посебно тврдоглав и груб, желећи фотографију на свој начин, а не да то природно ради. Можете покушати да присили дивље животиње да се понашају како желите. Али, ретко ко је успео силом. Инуиасха није био тако лош, међутим. Инуиасха је научио пре него што је била присиљена од њега. Постао је нежнији, разумљивији, зрелији, иако је било времена када је још био детињаст и самоуверен.<br/><br/>Сећа се како су јој црвени образи изгорели, али како је стајала на тлу и отпустила га. Рекла му је да одбија да ради за било кога или са било ким ко жели да уврне нешто изван природе, изван сопствених жеља.<br/><br/>Требала је упоредити човека са Нараку, а не Инуиасха. Иако њен клијент није имао такве екстремне намере. Барем је осећај након тога био пријатно сећање. Слобода да зна да је дошла толико далеко да је могла да одбије посао који није желела да ради, да буде сопствена особа која је била независна од других. Могла је да каже да је то урадила у том тренутку. Иако је чула гласине неколико дана касније са речима намењеним да је клевећу.<br/><br/>Бранила се праведно, као и пред крај свог путовања. На крају крајева, она је била једина која је могла да се заштити на овом свету.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Јутарње светло је почело да пузи у њен дом, поново је подсећајући на пролаз времена. Опет је разматрала листу ствари које је морала да уради и расправљала о томе одакле да почне. Или, ако би уопште требала да почне. Како је дан почео, није знала да ли би могла сматрати да је то сјајна идеја. Било је сумњиво да ће бити успјешна са тим колико је изгубљена у себи постала.<br/><br/>Није хтела да поквари свој најновији рад. Зато што је то радила у неколико прилика раније. Није било пријатно покушати да се опорави од потпуне катастрофе.<br/><br/>Кагоме се сећала осећања њеног скупог, потпуно новог, фотоапарата који јој је клизио из руку. Није била спремна да га подржи, јер га је управо извадила из торбе. Део ње је вриштао изнутра. Драматичан, овер-тхе-топ, пун на вриштање да је често урадио када је била много, много млађи. Када се борила да прође кроз средњу школу док скокове између времена. Други део ње је остао замрзнут на месту док јој је сочиво потпуно сломљено, а остатак камере је сломљен заједно са њим.<br/><br/>Видевши Инуиасхиног брата, пуног демона, који је стајао пред њом, била је последња ствар коју је очекивала када је изашла за своје фотографије. Стајао је поносан као и увек, висок као и увек, импозантан колико се сећала. Није уопште изгледао фазиран да буде у потпуно другачијем свету, иако никада није била најбоља у читању његових мисли. Његово име на њеним уснама било је толико моћно да се могла сетити најмањих осећања као што је то учинила. Усне су јој биле испуцале, уста су јој се осјећала сува, а мјехурићни осјећај анксиозности у стомаку учинио ју је болесном.<br/><br/>Није желела да јој се нада буде горе.<br/><br/>Али, она је желела да буде тамо, чак и ако нису били пријатељи. Били су савезници, ако ништа друго, јер су се борили раме уз раме. И нешто је било боље него апсолутно ништа.<br/><br/>А Кагоме је имала довољно разума да се не баци на њега, да омота руке око њега са олакшањем да знајући да није сама. Њена камера више није битно када му се приближи. Сећала се да данима ништа друго није било важно док је проводила време са њим, не говорећи о њиховом свету, већ говорећи (или, она је говорила и он је једноставно признао ту чињеницу).<br/><br/>Када се, тачно, заљубила у њега... Кагоме се није могла сетити. То је била суптилна ствар, баш као и он. Али она је знала да је осећај тамо. И он јој је дао до знања да није била сама у чињеници да је пала, да су осећања некако процветала.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Осећај бестежинског стања ју је прегазио и изненада су јој се отвориле очи, док је њен ум очајнички закачио за последњу ствар коју је радила. Није се сећала када је заспала на каучу, али је знала да је последње место на којем је била било на превише удобним јастуцима. Међутим, није се борила нити се борила против бестежинског стања док је била у познатим рукама. Њена глава нагнута према грудима Сессхоумару, узимајући утеху у чињеници да је био овде и да није била сама.<br/><br/>"Добродошли назад." Његов одговор је био меко зујање у признању. Није морао да говори много да би она разумела његову намеру, или остатак онога што је имао да каже.<br/><br/>Однео ју је назад у кревет, населио је у њој са лакоћом. Њене очи су се среле са његовим и она се насмејала лако јер више није било успомена, више сећања која су јој се задиркивала. Не, кад год је био близу, никада се није вратила у те мисли. Помогао је, и године су помогле, а данас је био само један од тих дана.<br/><br/>"Спавање." Он је командовао са лакоћом, очи су му се окренуле, али она се није борила јер је била уморна. Њена рука се чврсто држала за њега, док је осећала његову супротну руку притиском на чело у процени њеног благостања.<br/><br/>"Ја сам у реду", рекла је, њене речи чврсто са својим обећањем.<br/><br/>Била је добро, жива и срећна.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>Схиппер<br/><br/>сажетак<br/><br/>Кагоме, у једном тренутку у њеном животу, била је прилично редовна тинејџерка док је није напао демон унутар куће бунара њене породице. Демон ју је одвукао доле у бунар, који ју је магично транспортовао око 500 година у прошлост. Тамо је сазнала да је свети драгуљ био затворен у њеном телу јер је била реинкарнација свештенице која је умрла 50 година пре времена у које је увучена. Драгуљ је ишчупан из њеног тела, а демона који ју је вукао кроз време победио је полу-демон који је ослободио који је био причвршћен за дрво. Кагоме спријатељио полу-демон, Инуиасха, у времену и путовао са њим да врати драгуљ да је, она, сама, сломљена. Иако то није било тако једноставно и лако да се уради као многи демони и људи тражили драгуљ за своје сврхе. Она се спријатељила са младим кицуне демоном, монахом и убицом демона који су сви путовали са њом како би вратили драгуљ.<br/><br/>Њена група, међутим, није била та која је завршила драгуљ. Уместо тога, зли полу-демон који је манипулисао већином главних догађаја у већини живота њеног пратиоца. Када је коначно сакупио све комаде драгуља и пожелео на зараженом предмету, Кагоме је увучен у сам драгуљ са намером да направи себичну жељу да је задржи заробљену унутра заувек, држећи драгуљ жив. Била је тврдоглавост Инуиасха која је успела да је спаси од таме. На крају се вратила у своје природно време, завршила средњу школу као што се очекивало од дјевојке из њене временске линије. Иако неколико дана касније, Кагоме је завршила у Елисиону. Она је у овом свету већ пет година, и одавно је одустала од повратка кући. Срећно се населила у свом новом животу.<br/><br/>Платонизам<br/><br/>Прилично је лако за Кагоме да стекне нове пријатеље, она се није много променила од младости. Она је весела млада жена која је емпатична и добродошла највише у свом животу. У младости се спријатељила са демонима када би их се већина бојала. Чак и демони који су јели људе, она се спријатељила и променила своје начине (она би волела да мисли). Ово је речено, заиста је лако постати њен пријатељ све док неко може показати да је вољан да буде откупљен, или показати да нису потпуно зли. Она се веома осећа према свима које сретне, тако да јој је тешко да се не привуче другима у жељи да буду пријатељи.<br/><br/>антагонистички<br/><br/>Једини начин да заслужите Кагомин гнев је да будете тако жалосни, тако зли и тако далеко изван искупљења да не може да види добро у вама. И она може да види добро у скоро свима и свему. Искрено, са ким се суочила? Полу-демон који је ставио два љубавника један против другог, који је проклео целу мушку линију једног од њених пријатеља, а затим је брат њеног најбољег пријатеља убио своју породицу... Да, не видим да мрзи никога без њих стварно, стварно ради за то. Осећајте се слободно да га пуцају, међутим.<br/><br/>романтична<br/><br/>Када је заљубљен, Кагоме је јака подршка, увек остаје тамо чак и када ствари могу бити грубе. Међутим, Кагоме не тражи љубав, није тражио љубав када је стигла, тако да не постоје прошли односи. Ово не значи да се неко није заљубио у њу. Она дефинитивно може бити предмет нечије неузвраћене љубави, али ће вероватно бити заборављена на то. Коначно, Кагоме је тренутно ангажован у Сессхоумару, изненађујуће. Потпуно сам отворен за потенцијалне АУ ствари, мада. <3<br/><br/>фандом пакао<br/><br/>доба антике<br/><br/>врста простор краљица<br/><br/>Окупација умире<br/><br/>Више воли она / она<br/><br/>Награде<br/><br/>про схе / хер ест КСНУМКСвоо ја сисати на парцели одговора. али у сваком случају ок !!! нептун је веома пријатељски и има ту 'цоол' персона, он је стварно забавно да буде око, и он је СУПЕР добро радити са. као да је супер пацијент и он ће учинити све што она тражи од њега - он је стварно лако радити са, дефинитивно у поређењу са другим моделима. тако да волим идеју да су сви радно оријентисани пријатељи у почетку, а затим се претварају у нешто више. Нептун дефинитивно покушава да се окружи људима, јер воли да има пријатеље, а кагоме је прилично његов тип? као да је слатка и јака жена, а он је заправо бољи пријатељ са женама него што је са мушкарцима, идк зашто, он само воли да буде окружен женским пријатељима који знају. Волим своје момке који су супер добри пријатељи и штите своје пријатељице искрено. али ох М А Н волим пседуо-породичне односе и Нептун је једино дете, тако да није имао такве, породичне односе као што је то. тако да је њена брига за њега све старије сестре као да би га као ???? јер је збуњен, али и он заправо стварно воли тај ЛОЛ! обојица су добра деца, мислим да би било стварно забавно ^^<br/><br/>фандом ватра амблем: судбине<br/><br/>Старост Нинтеен<br/><br/>врста део човек / део змај<br/><br/>окупациони представник чувар<br/><br/>Више воли она / она<br/><br/>Награде<br/><br/>yonder she/her aest 20 постова<br/><br/>Нисам видео Инујашу уопште, али... из онога што сам прочитао Кагоме изгледа да је један од оних људи који би могли да помогну Корин са њеним емоционалним стањем. Има много тога на њеном уму јер је морала да се бори против своје породице против своје воље и последњи пут када их је видела, сви су је мрзели. Искрено, она још није све прошла, јер је у суштини била на челу рата. Осећам да би могли бити пријатељи јер је Цоррин прилично отворена у својој личности, изузетно повјерења.

Волим твоју идеју Кагоме узимајући слику Елса! Знате, она је такође певачица / извођач у локалном позоришту, тако да могу да замислим Кагоме иде тамо да измери ствари и онда ухвати Елсу иза сцене или нешто - и онда пријатељство може процветати одатле! Апсолутно обожавам идеју да ова два квалитетна БФФ времена заједно раде мале, али забавне ствари које Елса никада није искусила као дете. Ово ће бити тако драгоцено и треба ми овај здрави пух !! <3 Реците ми шта мислите о тој идеји~ |
| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Зашто бисте требали бити на Твиттеру<br/><br/>Одрицање од одговорности: Ја нисам, нити сам икада тврдио да сам, гуру друштвених медија. Ја сам само особа која много размишља о стварима, а то се догодило неколико пута.<br/><br/>Ја нисам рани усвајач. Понекад ми требају године да схватим за шта желим да користим нешто пре него што заправо дођем до тога, а Твиттер је једна од тих ствари. Озбиљно сам на Твиттеру од фебруара ове године, тако да сам прилично нови у томе. Ипак, научио сам неколико ствари, и желео сам да их поделим. Неки људи кажу да сам Твиттер гурач, и јесам, јер постоји много добрих разлога да се на то, и практично нема недостатака.<br/><br/>Дакле, шта је Твиттер? Ако сте на интернету, вероватно сте барем чули за њега. То је мрежа друштвених медија која служи као форум за разговоре, ажурирања и вести у медију који је јавнији од нечега попут Фацебоок-а или ЛинкедИн-а. Фацебоок је о томе ко жели да вас пронађе, али Твиттер је о томе кога желите да пронађете. Ваши омиљени писци, глумци, политичари, певачи и научници су вероватно на Твиттер-у. Као и ваше омиљене добротворне организације, радио станице, вести и продавнице. И они желе да их нађете и слушате шта имају да кажу. Сви на Твиттеру, барем у почетку, желе да разговарају са вама.<br/><br/>Али зашто се придружити томе? Зашто бити део тога? Постоје разни разлози, а ја ћу вам дати неколико.<br/><br/>Људи и места Твиттер је одличан начин да сазнате о догађајима који се дешавају широм света, али иу вашој заједници. Ако путујете и тражите ствари које треба урадити, то је одличан начин да сазнате о стварима релевантним за ваше интересе (јер су људи које пратите људи за које сте заинтересовани). Чак и ако не путујете, знајући о одличним местима да иду локално или знајући да људи сте заинтересовани за њих ће створити прилику да их упознам и створити дубљи однос са њима. Ако се вратите на моју партијску поруку, све људе у њој осим двојице, чуо сам на Твитеру, а затим се упознао у стварном животу, и сада смо прилично добри пријатељи. И што више радите ово, више ствари ћете сазнати о, и више људи ћете упознати. А ако их пратите на Твитеру, већ знате помало о томе какви су. Они то желе. Обрнуто је такође тачно, јер твитовање позива људе да виде какав си ти, и они могу да донесу исте одлуке о теби.<br/><br/>Инспирација и мотивација<br/>Инспирација долази са најчуднијих места, а прилив твитова значи да увек постоји свеж садржај за вашу машту. Имам прву политику, тако да ћу пратити скоро свакога, а затим повремено пролазити и одустати од људи. Не знам ко ће засадити семе новог блога или новог пројекта у мени, тако да волим да држим своје опције отворене. Мотивација се такође дешава, јер је Твиттер као живот. Ако се окружите људима који су амбициозни, посвећени, великодушни и вредни, лакше је бити такав и гурнути се. Лакше је мислити да ако могу планирати догађаје, покренути пројекте или само устати ујутро, па, можете и ви.<br/><br/>Леарнинг и Лифестиле Блоггерс су на Твиттер-у. Блогери који нису заправо могу бити луди. И људи блогирају о свему. Ако желите нешто научити, шансе су добре да неко твеетује о томе. Поврх тога, новинске услуге и продавнице су такође повезане, што значи да можете добити своје вести до тренутка и сазнати о продаји и понудама док почињу. Што се тиче начина живота, тражите нове идеје за рецепте? Пратите неке угоститеље и видите шта су смислили. Треба ли вам преокрет за ту коктел забаву? Твиттер има и људе за то. Препоруке ормара, или само желите да видите шта други људи раде са својим животима? Све је ту.<br/><br/>Постоје неки уобичајени изазови са којима се суочавам када говорим о томе, а то су легитимне препреке. Може изгледати прилично застрашујуће, поготово ако касните на траку, као што сам ја. Провео сам мјесеце пратећи само двоје људи и не знајући шта друго да радим. Али постоје начини да их превазиђемо и чујемо да су од најмање честих до већине.<br/><br/>#КСНУМКС: Твиттер је за нарцисоидне кретене<br/>Мислим да ово долази из идеје да већина људи твитује за себе и о себи као начин да привуче пажњу. Оно што не схватам је зашто постоји нешто лоше у томе, или зашто то чини нарциса или кретена. Ако неко има нешто да каже, желе да буду саслушани. Некада сте стајали на углу улице и викали. Сада можете викати у 140 карактера или мање. Твиттер је само нови начин да се чује. Сада, сигурно постоје нарцисоидни кретени на Твиттеру. Они су скоро свуда. Понекад су људи кретени. Понекад сам један од тих људи, жао ми је што то кажем. Не пратите те људе. Ако вам се не свиђа оно што неко говори, било да су то тачке које праве или детаљни рачуни о својим активностима у купатилу, не морате слушати на Твиттер-у.<br/><br/># 2 Не могу да пратим све.<br/>Друга препрека коју људи често помињу је да једноставно немају времена да прате све ствари које се дешавају на Твиттеру. И знате шта? То је у реду. Пратите шта можете. Можда лутате само сваких неколико дана. Ако сте приватни корисник (уместо да твеете за своју компанију), а посебно почетник, то је у реду. Део нечега је бољи од свега ништа.<br/><br/># 1 Немам ништа што желим да ставим тамо.<br/>Ово је далеко најчешћи изазов који људи постављају. И то чак није ни битно. Не морате се придружити Твиттер-у да бисте разговарали. Придружите се да бисте слушали. Опет, ваши омиљени аутори, певачи, блогери и новине су овде. Ово је ваша шанса да их саслушате.

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Роот Цханнелс<br/><br/>Сама помисао на добијање коренског канала ставља већину људи на ивицу. СЦМ Дентал користи најновију технологију и технику како би коренски канал постао практично безболна и ниска процедура стреса.<br/><br/>Ротациона ендодонција је напредна технологија и техника за извођење ендодонтског третмана, клинички термин за коренски каналТермин "корени канал" се односи на природну шупљину у центру зуба. Зубни нерв се налази у меком ткиву (пулпа) унутар кореновог канала. Ако је зуб оштећен или траумом или пропадањем, остаци могу ући у осетљиво подручје кореновог канала и изазвати инфекцију, или у екстремним околностима, и апсцес. Апсцесирани зуб је веома озбиљан и треба га третирати као хитан случај, јер може створити инфекцију која се може ширити на друге делове тела. Ако верујете да имате апсцесирани зуб, одмах контактирајте нашу канцеларију како бисте заказали хитну помоћ.<br/><br/>У зависности од случаја, терапија кореновим каналом може захтевати више од једне посете. Почетни рендгенски снимак ће се узети за процену зуба и коренског канала и одредити степен оштећења и инфекције ако је присутан. Биће вам дат облик анестезије да бисте се опустили.<br/><br/>Када је подручје укочено, наш зубар ће створити приступну комору до кореновог канала помоћу електричног рукохвата.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Цхурцхиард Дно Дрво<br/><br/>Хигхгате<br/><br/>Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод, Хајгејт<br/><br/>Сада се зове краљичино дрво<br/><br/>Између 1860. и 1880. центар је ишчупан из Лондона како би се изградиле канализације, пруге и нови путеви. Куће су срушене без обзира на станаре који су морали да пронађу било какав смештај другде. Менаџери су отишли у Ливо у Кенсингтон и Сент Џонс Вуд, док су се најсиромашнији гужвали у кухињама као што су Севен Диалс и Лиссон Грове. За оне између, службеници и квалификовани радници, спекулативни градитељи поставили су ред за редом терасисаних вила, а господин Поотер се преселио у Холловеи. Људи Мусвелл Хилла су гледали куће како пузе преко поља Финсбури Парка, горе Цроуцх Хилл и доле са друге стране, тако да је до 1880. године Цроуцх Енд био развијен и чинило се да нема начина да се заустави проток. Десет година касније, велика имања Мусвелл Хилла су продата. Фарма Уптон је продата и црквени комесари су желели да развију Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод, сада зове Краљичино дрво. Прича би направила Ибсен представу. Две групе искрених, високо мотивисаних људи боре се за оно што су мислили да је у праву. Црквени комесари, с једне стране, и Комитет Хорнсеи добротворних организација, с друге стране, обојица су веровали да дају све од себе за друге људе, а јавност је устала против њих обоје у огорчењу.<br/><br/>У то време Мусвелл Хилл Роад је био сеоски пут, са Соутхвоод Халл на једном крају и Уптон Фарм на другом. До 1894, Онслов Гарденс је изграђен, Цоннаугхт Гарденс означен, а градитељи су спремни да развију Воодландс имање. Изрезано из Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод је била група колиба, на троугластом месту. Недатирана мапа, коју држе црквени комесари, показује шест Пустошних колиба са отвором између њих - не пут, не метализован, већ пут до кревета од јагода иза. Даље је био још један јаз који је довео до пешачких стаза кроз дрво. Ова два отвора су требала бити основа плана. Иста два јаза и очишћено тло, које је било поље јагода, могу се видети на мапи из 1894. године испод. Они су приказани као "Мусвелл Хилл Цоттагес" и, сасвим у пролазу, Петер Селлерс је живео на истој локацији много касније. Да би развили дрво као стамбено насеље, комесари су морали возити два пута од Мусвелл Хилл Роада и градити куће дуж њих. Сам Мусвелл Хилл Роад фронт не би обезбедио довољно простора за куће да би се подухват исплатио.<br/><br/>Земљиште и викендице су дате много раније као милостиње за смештај старих људи и држали су их у њихово име повереници Хорнсеи добротворних комесара. До 1890-их викендице су се срушиле, потребне су велике поправке. Јавно настројени, желећи да учине најбоље за своје старе станаре, повереници их нису могли побољшати јер нису имали новца. Неколико година пре него што су црквени комесари планирали да развију Гравел Пит Воод (сада Хајгејт Воод) као стамбено насеље, али то је наишло на такво противљење да су се повукли. Уместо тога, 1886. године, дали су јавности свих 69 хектара шуме. Истовремено су понудили да продају Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод Хорнсеи Урбан Дистрицт Цоунцил за 25.000 фунти, али то је било превише за Хорнсеи да се подигне сама. Савет је рекао да су људи који живе изван Хорнсеи такође уживали у дрвету и другим властима треба да помогну, али није дата помоћ. На крају је понуда пала у застој.<br/><br/>Мапа приказује Мусвелл Хилл Цоттагес који су били центар контроверзе.<br/><br/>Мусвелл Хилл Роад око 1880. године<br/><br/>Чини се вероватно да су ова три пара викендица била у центру спора.<br/><br/>Црквени комесари су желели да прикупе новац за свој црквени рад у Британији и иностранству. Сматрали су да им је дато земљиште да се користи за пропогатни јон религије и ако је то значило продају земље или шуме, то је било мање зло него ограничавање рада цркве. Они су дали Гравел Пит Воод јавности: на његовом мјесту би развили Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод.<br/><br/>Повереници Хорнсеи добротворних организација желели су да произведу приход како би помогли својим сиромашним људима, па су дали понуду комесарима. Њихов троугаони комад земље био је превише незгодан да би се економски развио, али ако би им комесари дали још земљишта да га претворе у квадратно мјесто, изградили би двадесет пет уредних вила. Они би донели земљишне ренте од 225 фунти годишње, које би се могле користити за ублажавање сиромаштва Хорнсеи људи. Заузврат би дозволили Комисији да пресече два пута кроз њихову земљу како би комесари могли да развију шуму.<br/><br/>Када је ова понуда постала позната, људи су одмах реаговали са алармом.<br/><br/>16. децембра 1893. посланик Карвел Вилијамс питао је у Доњем дому, да ли су црквени комесари пристали да продају траку земље Хорнсеи добротворним повереницима под условом да се постојећи пут прошири на 40 стопа, да ли је то прелиминарни план изградње и да ли ће Дом парламента имати прилику да изрази мишљење.<br/><br/>Господин Левесон Говер, комесар за црквену имовину, одговорио је "Да" на први део.<br/><br/>Господин Карвел Вилијамс, "Да ли разумем да је намера да се уништи тај део Хајгејт Вудса изградњом на њему?"<br/><br/>Два дана касније, The Star је објавио чланак вредан сваког модерног таблоида.<br/><br/>Звезда<br/>18. децембар 1893<br/><br/>"Парламент мора пажљиво пазити на те старе вандале и савезнике градитеља црквених комесара. Они увек отуђују неки комад земље или фаворизују градитеље насупрот општој јавности. Повереници нису хтели да продају дрво црквеног дворишта, већ сада предлажу да се „отвори“ тако што ће кроз њега проћи два широка пута у вези са једном од њихових бројних грађевинских шема. Зар неће неко поставити питање у парламенту и проверити политику комесара од цигле и малтера?<br/><br/>До тренутка када је ово одштампано, питање је било постављено и одговор је био или неистинит или лукав. Други радови су узели причу. Тајмс је у дугом извештају навео да Комнуссионери нису спремни да дају обавезу да Парламент, или било које друго јавно тело, треба да има прилику да размотри било коју шему за изградњу на месту дрвета.<br/><br/>Ситуација је трајала осамнаест месеци све док црквени комесари нису били приморани да покрену истрагу, која је почела у Хајгејту 31. маја 1895. године, на челу са помоћником црквеног комесара. Истрага је произвела вреву новинских писама од којих је ово било најважније.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5. јун 1895.<br/><br/>ВАНДАЛИЗАМ НА ВИСОКОМ ГРАДУ<br/><br/>Господине –<br/><br/>Угрожена је једна од најлепших шума у подводном Лондону. Хоћете ли нам помоћи да одбранимо оно што би била катастрофа, не само у непосредном округу, већ и у целом густо насељеном Северном Лондону? Ни у једном делу метрополе градитељ није био активнији него у Цроуцх Енду и Хорнсеиу. Прелепе ливаде пре годину или две су сада куће и продавнице. Баластне гомиле су заузеле место величанствених брезова и кестена, а некада пријатна села деле судбину Строуд Греен, Харрингаи, Финсбури Парк, Хигхбури и Ислингтон. ---<br/><br/>---- Објекат је изградња два четрдесет стопа путева кроз шуму. Ми у овом округу знамо значење четрдесет стопа путева кроз шуму. То значи да су шуме осуђене на пропаст. Пре десет година агитација је спасила сестринско дрво од шездесет пет хектара - Шљунчане шуме - и нико ко је видео гужву Банк Холидаи-а који се окупљају Арцхваи Роад из суморних улица Холловаи, Ислингтон и Цлеркенвелл, и гледао оштро уживање деце и породичних забава пикника на трави и међу дрве, могао је да не схвати огромно дрво. ----<br/><br/>Црквени комесари поседују скоро трећину велике парохије Хорнсеи. Либералним трошењем новца плаћалаца стопа на отварање путева и општим развојем округа, вредност њихове имовине је изузетно повећана, и од тог незарађеног прираста они сваке године извлаче велике приходе. Свакако, плаћаоци стопа чији је новац тако помогао у стварању огромног имања могу очекивати либерални третман заузврат.<br/><br/>Твоја покорност,<br/><br/>Потписао је Викар Сент Џејмс, Масвел Хил, министар парка Капела, Крауч Енд, адвокат који живи у Онслоу Гарденс и три члана окружног савета.<br/><br/>То је био пуцањ право преко лукова црквених комесара. Њихови верски лидери и Окружно веће, сви у оружју говорећи у ствари да је црква сувише богата и треба да буде добротворна, а не похлепна. Укључивање два свештеника је био лукав потез. Запамтите да је то још увек било на врхунцу Дарвин контроверзе. Дарвин је поделио веру у учења Цркве и многи људи би огорчили моћ Цркве само са те тачке гледишта. Црква није била тако сигурна као што се претварала да буде.<br/><br/>Вечерње вести, 7. јуна 1895. године рекао је:<br/><br/>Ако се Црквени савезници не ријеше одједном, хоботница ће добити дрво које ће касније бити веома тешко олабавити. Стога би требало да Лондонци буду и раде ако би сачували један од својих најлепших делова рустичног пејзажа. Јавна истрага је одложена за четвртак, а пре тога мора се урадити нешто како би се повереници уверили да грађани Лондона неће толерисати конфискацију једног од њихових омиљених игралишта.<br/><br/>Писмо у Даили Цхроницле следећег дана је рекао:<br/><br/>..... Било је велико олакшање да су становници, пре неких десет година, чули да је куповина Горње шуме извршена; и како је дивно благо то показало, свако ко их је посетио може сведочити, али сви који су се трудили да спасу ове горње шуме, које леже на западној страни пута Мусвелл Хилл, сматрали су да је њихова победа непотпуна све док је шездесет хектара на источној страни остала у опасности. То је, као што је, случајност да су шуме подељене широким високим путем. Може ли ико сумњати у ефекат који би био ако би Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод замијенили редови малих вила, од којих свака шаље свој допринос дима и чађи? Може ли ико сумњати у озбиљну разлику коју би то направило сликовитом окружењу купљене шуме ако би се линија зурећих нових кућа покренула право на њихову лиснату фасаду?<br/><br/>То је изразило мишљење многих људи. У ствари, Шљунчана јама, коју писац назива "Горња шума", није купљена, већ је дата округу од стране Црквене комисије, тачка коју су требали поновити изнова и изнова током година, али већина људи је игнорисала. Комисија није хтела да одустане од другог дрвета, шта год да је неко рекао, и задржала је ту позицију до краја.<br/><br/>Х.С. Цхамберлаин, од 5 Цранлеи Гарденс, у писму Тајмсу од 8. јуна 1895. године, позвао је на куповину.<br/><br/>Знам да је уобичајено да се оштро говори о пољима црквених комесара, али као мали повереници фонда они су обавезни да га управљају у највећу корист, и стога, ако се нешто може учинити да се спаси рушење дрвета, чини ми се да се то може учинити само куповином имовине од Цоннуссионера, за које знам, да су у потпуности живи за заштиту слободног простора.<br/><br/>(Ово се односи на Цроуцх Енд Плаиинг Фиелдс који је обезбеђен неколико година касније.)<br/><br/>Као председник конзервативне асоцијације Мусвелл Хилл, стално сам у контакту са становницима и могу са сигурношћу потврдити да би свака особа која живи у сусједству учинила све што је у разуму да се очува.<br/><br/>(Све што је лично желео био је добротворни приход за подршку свог сиромашног народа. Захтевао је свој јутар земље - не много сигурно - веровао је у уверавање комесара да дрво није у опасности.)<br/><br/>Мусвелл Хилл Роад је био један од најбољих у Хорнсеиу и остао би једнако леп, куће или без кућа.<br/><br/>(А онда је дошао велики реторички процват.)<br/><br/>Да ли ће сиромашни патити због сентименталних приговора и хистеричног крика "вука" које су подигли ваши дописници? Један јутар земље додате добротворној држави не би учинио никакву значајну разлику у преосталој земљи, док би добитак из ње помогао многим сиромашним старим и достојним особама у њиховим годинама опадања и омогућио нам да предамо нашим наследницима имање које би у далекој будућности било од велике вредности у пружању добротворне помоћи достојним сиромашним у парохији Хорнсе.<br/><br/>Читајући његово писмо, човек осећа хистерију веома близу површине. Зашто је мислио да комесари желе да изграде пут? Зашто би трошили сав тај новац ако не на изградњу кућа? Изгледа да никада није схватио да ће за један хектар земље све дрво бити изгубљено. Али он је био са проблемом дуго времена. Он је био особа којој су комесари раније понудили продају за 25.000 фунти и то је његово име које је почаствовано на плочи на торњу са сатом Цроуцх Енд за спашавање дрвета, али његово поверење у црквене комесаре изгледа наивно. Тужно је што је у истрази требало да буде бачен као ђаво.<br/><br/>Истраживање се наставило<br/><br/>Одложено је отворено у Хајгејту 15. јуна 1895. Очекујући велико окупљање, Саветска комора је потпуно промењена. Уобичајени столови су уклоњени, а соба је испуњена столицама. До поноћи у седам сала је била препуна, а људи су се борили за седишта.<br/><br/>Господин Мареј, комесар, рекао је да је истрага заиста једноставна. Хорнсеи Парохијалне добротворне организације желеле су да купе комад земље који се налази поред њихове добротворне имовине у позадини. Питање је било да ли је Комисија за добротворне сврхе, која је контролисала све добротворне сврхе, имала довољно моћи да их заустави. Црквени комесари су били спремни да продају земљиште под веома повољним условима, а приходи од добротворне сврхе би били знатно повећани.<br/><br/>Против тога су постојале три врсте приговора.<br/><br/>Првобитни Труст је био у сврху обезбеђивања кућа за сиромашне, али су повереници предложили изградњу вила које би биле прескупе за сиромашне. Међутим, то је било у моћи повереника да варирају услове Труста, тако да су могли да граде виле ако су мислили да ће сиромашни имати користи на крају. Сиромашни људи сами би могли да приговоре, али су им већ обећане либералне одредбе. Трећи приговор се односио на естетску и јавну страну питања. Из онога што је прочитао, он је узео да се Комисија за добротворне сврхе мора умешати како би спречила црквене комесаре да користе своју дискрецију у руковању својом имовином.<br/><br/>У истрази су се разматрале фине тачке, али су се говорници стално враћали на главни проблем спречавања било каквог уништавања дрвета. Носни службеник из Ислингтона, који је представљао 300.000 људи, направио је формални протест због било ког дела дрвета, толико вриједног за људе Ислингтона и Хорнсеи-а који се користе у приватне сврхе. Вилфред Вајт је рекао да ће, ако им повереници дају времена, моћи да прикупе новац за компензацију повереника.<br/><br/>Бомонт је рекао да не желе виле, већ викендице за сиромашне људе који су протерани из округа. Други су рекли да нема новца за изградњу викендица које би замениле садашње, али би виле биле економски предлог. Други су узвратили да постоји велики број вила које се могу пустити у Хигхгате. Дрво је било свето. Држите се питања о дрвету.<br/><br/>Др Флечер је рекао да је крик међу радним људима био да нема где да се иде. Радни људи су дошли до њега са криком, "Ми смо истерани из Хајгејта и обавезни смо да одемо у Хајгејт Нови град." Ако је продата фасада Мусвел Хилл Роад-а, није било сумње да би путеви могли бити пресечени кроз шуму у правцу Хорнсеи-а, али ако комесари нису могли добити земљу од Добротворне комисије, нису могли пресећи пут.<br/><br/>Био је веома сигуран да се викендице могу ставити у исправно стање поправке. Питали су га сиромашни људи, полиција и бројне радничке класе да представљају ове две тачке, да је смештај за викендице био веома потребан у Хајгејту и да ако једном допусте да се земљиште прода, није било познато где ће рука градитеља остати.<br/><br/>(Гласно и продужено ћаскање).<br/><br/>Бројни други људи су говорили, а саговорник је сумирао рекавши да је сматрао да је преовлађујуће мишљење у корист задржавања викендица, али састанак не би требало да доноси закључке из онога што је рекао (Гроанс).<br/><br/>Други су рекли да су повереници добротворне организације пропустили своје дужности тако што су дозволили да викендице пропадну.<br/><br/>Х.Р. Вилијамс, повереник који је раније писао новинама, рекао је да има најбоље овлашћење да црквени комесари не праве путеве и да неће имати користи од акција добротворних комесара. Остали су били далеко мање повјерљиви и састанак је завршен након скоро три сата.<br/><br/>„Суочени смо са чињеницом да у Хигхгатеу и Мусвелл Хиллу постоји велики број људи који желе Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод и неће бити срећни док га не добију - док изгледа да нико није вољан да потроши новчић да плати за то. Сви кажу да би било лепо имати дрво као отворени простор, али сви мисле да је дужност неког другог да га направи. Ислингтон Вестри је 'решио' на ову тему, али Ислингтон Вестри не нуди пени за куповину. Нема тежег проблема за заједницу или појединца да реши него како да стекну власништво над имовином других људи без плаћања за то. "<br/><br/>Плаћање за то је заиста био проблем као Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод постао предмет интензивне локалне и националне дебате. Заједнички комитет је формиран да прикупи новац да сачува дрво. Дана 20. новембра 1896, Ц.Ф. Цори-Вригхт, Хон Треасурер, написао је Стандарду, дневним новинама у то вријеме, позивајући на помоћ. Подсјетио је све о опасности од губитка дрвета и рекао да се може спасити само куповином. Црквени комесари ће продати за £ 25.000 и додатни (5,000 би било потребно за ограде и одводњавање, што укупно £ 30,000. То је било превише за Хорнсеи Савета да подигне, али су већ гласали £ 10,000 према укупном. Шума је била од непроцењиве вредности за цео Северни Лондон, па је апеловао на јавна тела и приватне људе да подигну преосталих 20.000 фунти. Он је упозорио да је садашња понуда црквених комесара била отворена само до краја 1898. године. Након тога, градитељи ће се преселити.<br/><br/>Жалба је била топло поздрављена од стране штампе. Приватни закон је прошао кроз парламент и Закон о очувању Хигхгате Воодс, 1897, постао закон. Цонуниттее је сада имао право да рекламира доприносе за куповину дрвета и очување.<br/><br/>У прилично кратком времену готово сав новац је прикупљен, али се последњих неколико хиљада показало веома тешким за прикупљање, а рок за комесаре био је само питање недеља. Кори-Рајт је написао молбу за више времена, али је добио само три месеца и онда само ако је камата од 4% плаћена за додатни период на пуну суму. На крају, Лондон Цоунти Цоунцил, који је првобитно понудио 2.500 фунти, направио је ово до 5.000 фунти и укупно је постигнуто, али то је била ствар изблиза.<br/><br/>Савет је одлучио да дрво преименује у "Краљичину шуму" у част дијамантског јубилеја краљице Викторије, а Хорнсеи је ставио фини приказ боја када је војвоткиња од Олбанија формално прогласила дрво отвореним "за слободну употребу јавности заувек".<br/><br/>Док су кампању за спашавање Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод водили и водили локални људи који су страствено осећали овај одређени комад шуме, позвали су на помоћ и искуство огромне мреже људи, од којих су неки радили заједно на сличним кампањама више од тридесет година. Одбор је издао жалбу, штампану на веома квалитетном папиру и са неким познатим именима.<br/><br/>Питања отвореног простора и јавног здравља била су главне теме викторијанске визије.<br/><br/>Покрет отворених простора<br/><br/>Октавија Хил, велика стамбена реформаторка, која је почела са три старе куће у Марилебонеу, коју јој је купио Јолм Рускин, брзо је постала стручњак за смештај сиромашних људи у најздравијим могућим условима. Њен начин је био да купи закуп, а затим сруши неке од препуних кућа како би донела светлост и ваздух осталима, верујући да су свеж ваздух и сунчева светлост једини начин да се сиромашни људи могу спасити од "трулежне грознице". Ово је научила као дете од свог деде, Соутхвоод Смитха, који је развио своје теорије у болници Февер у Кинг'с Цроссу.<br/><br/>Изградио је прве индустријске станове за сиромашне људе и статистички је доказао да је добар ваздух и пристојна дренажа спасила животе. Гибсон Гарденс, у Нортхволд Роаду, директан је резултат идеја Соутхвоод Смитха. Више информација о Гибсон Гарденс<br/><br/>Важност отвореног ваздуха<br/><br/>Отворени простори и прилика да се удахне чист ваздух, били су од суштинског значаја за људе који живе у једној или две гужве. Октавија Хил је преузела своје оптужбе из сиротишта Лисон Гроув, до Фитзјохнове авеније до Хампстеад Хеатх. Толико је волела поља Фитзјохн'с Авенуе да је покушала да их купи као јавни парк. Требало је да коштају 10.000 фунти, а у року од три недеље августа подигнуто је 8.500 фунти. Требало је само крај летњих одмора и повратак са одмора симпатичних пријатеља, а додатних 1.500 фунти би се подигло, али власници су изненада повукли своју понуду. Упркос свим молбама, поља су била покривена великим кућама.<br/><br/>Из овога је развијена кампања за спашавање Парламентског брда, следећег отвореног простора северно од Лиссон Гровеа, купујући поља на путу градитеља како би направили стални санитарни кордон против напредујућих цигли. Кампања Парламент Хилл Фиелдс била је толико успешна да је усвојен Хампстеад Хеатх Билл и било је новца од жалбе. Из тог новца и подстицаја према отвореним просторима, требало је да се развије Национално поверење. Оцтавиа Хилл је годинама била заинтересована за заштиту подручја као што је Цхурцх Боттом Воод, тако да је била природни савезник у борби за спашавање шуме.<br/><br/>Друштво за очување Цоммонс такође је било упознато са овом врстом агитације и прикупљања новца. Срушили су ограде када су господари имања затворили комаде заједничке земље, водећи и легалне и илегалне битке против арогантне приватизације традиционално слободне земље. Роберт Хантер, њихов почасни адвокат из 1868. године, увек је био забринут за обезбеђивање отворених простора, великих или малих, за јавност. Он је, сада Сер Роберт Хантер, постао председник Цркве Доњег жалбе. Председник Друштва за очување Заједнице био је господин Шоу-Лефевр (касније Лорд Еверсли) који је одиграо велику улогу у овој и другим кампањама у Доњем дому. Октавија Хил је била укључена у њихов рад од око 1875. године.<br/><br/>Истовремено, Оцтавиа Хилл је водила кампању за закон о сахрањивању.<br/><br/>Градска црквена дворишта постала су тако пуна и тако озбиљна опасност по здравље, загађивањем бунара из којих су људи црпили воду за пиће, да градске сахране више нису биле дозвољене. Уместо тога, гробља су створена на периферији града. Гробље Абнеи Парк је било једно од њих. Тада је постојао покрет за уклањање надгробних споменика на ивице старих градских гробља, поновно затрпавање тела на другом месту и претварање гробља у вртове и отворене просторе, уместо да се граде на њима. Ова земља у центру Лондона била је веома вредна и спекуланти су били жељни да је добију: Чак су и Квекери изградили једно од својих гробља и претили да ће то поново учинити изградњом над Бунхилл Фиелдс. Октавија Хил је имала мрежу савезника на десетак поља, тако да је њена помоћ у спасавању црквеног Доњег дрвета морала бити непроцењива.<br/><br/>Друштво Метрополитан Гарденс, основано 1882. године, поставило је око две стотине малих вртова у градским центрима до 1890. године. Касније су их предали локалним властима, тако да је њихова подршка Цхурцхиард Боттом Воод Апел била осигурана од самог почетка.<br/><br/>Друштво Кирле је сада заборављено, али је у своје време имало велики утицај на урбанистичко планирање и законодавство о отвореном простору. Друштво је основано око 1875. године за "Дифузију лепоте", да унесе боју и интерес у животе људи који живе у досадном, мрачном окружењу. Светле боје зидова и декорације, добро певање, отворени простори, Природа, књижевност и уметност. Све ово је било у надлежности Друштва. Постојала је Декоративна грана, за коју је Вилијам Морис предавао; Музичка грана за промоцију хорова и Срећних вечери за људе у локалним школским зградама; и Књижевна грана. Друштво је редовно апеловало писма у Тајмсу, на "богатије класе" за књиге и периодике које ће се дистрибуирати дечацима и девојчицама клубовима, милостињама и другде. Међутим, Комитет за отворене просторе је био најактивнији. Сам назив "Кирле" потиче од папе "Човек Роса", филантропа који је дао своје место рођења људима као јавни парк. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Са Дан захвалности иза угла, ево неких свечаних игара за датотеке које смо направили за дјевојчице. Обе игре захвалности фокусирају се на математичке вјештине. И још једном сам захвалан свом мужу Еду што је направио све клипарте за мене.<br/><br/>Дан захвалности Узорак Израда<br/><br/>Као што име каже, ова игра је о прављењу образаца. Мали само уче о обрасцима, могу једноставно подударати слике на тракама узорка, док други могу наставити образац са сликовницама на празним тракама.<br/><br/>Да бисте направили фасциклу датотеке, желите да исечете мрежу слика како бисте направили делове картице. Препоручујем да их ламинирате како би им помогли да трају дуже. Затим лепите траке узорка доле на фасциклу датотеке.<br/><br/>Желео сам да имам и празне траке узорка како би девојке могле да виде где да наставе образац и колико да положе. Причврстио сам их на страну фасцикле користећи траку како би се могли преклопити како би спаковали игру и проширили на распоред узорка.<br/><br/>Такође сам додао додатни празан један, тако да су девојке могле да направе и свој образац.<br/><br/>Турска Број игре<br/><br/>У овој игри девојке додају перје на тело ћурке док вежбате бројање и препознавање бројева. Користио сам безбојно перје да делује као водич за где да додате перје и тако да девојке могу да одговарају бројевима. И будите сигурни када лепите тело ћурке само лепите у центру тако да крила могу клизити испод тела.<br/><br/>Када су сва перја постављена, практикујемо неку једноставну аритметику, као што је одузимање три перја и гледање колико је остало, а затим додавање два назад да видимо шта је једнако.<br/><br/>Поред црно-белих крила, укључили смо и безбојну ћурку у случају да желите да малишани обоје свој сет. Уместо игре фасцикле датотека можете ово претворити у занат, бојење комада, их исећи и лепљење заједно.<br/><br/>Друга опција је да користите комаде како бисте направили причу од филца. Понекад певамо ћуретину верзију КСНУМКС Литтле Индианс:<br/><br/>Овако:<br/><br/>Ко сам ја?<br/><br/>Мислим да овде треба да кажем нешто духовито о себи. Ох, добро. Ја сам мајка која остаје код куће за троје дивне деце - наше ћерке близанце које сада имају седам година и двогодишњег сина који је пун енергије. У мом пред-дечјем животу био сам учитељ и ја сада домшкола нашу децу. Такође сам ожењен са Едом, који тренутно служи у ваздухопловству, и љубав мог живота (било би неугодно да није). Наша породица је велика у књигама, занатима и забави заједно. Само сам мислио да ћу поделити наше активности у свом малом углу интернета.<br/><br/>Зое изгледа да је све-богат, згодан муж, лако Нев Иорк живот--али она је направила грешке у прошлости и те грешке се враћају у свом новом животу. Нашао сам се на ивици мог седишта за већину књиге и био изненађен ...<br/><br/>Волео сам ову књигу, волим причу, и захвалан сам Маргот Схеттерли га је довео до светлости. Моја једина жалба је била да сам желео да је разговарала о улози Катхерине Јохнсон у каснијим мисијама мало више, али претпостављам да је прича морала да заврши Сом ...<br/><br/>Хтео сам да волим ову књигу и то сам урадио током већине тога.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Употреба алкохола од стране особа млађих од 21 године идентификована је као велики проблем јавног здравља. Студије напомињу да повећава ризик од инвалидитета и може бити штетан за мозак у развоју. Малолетници који пију вероватније ће извршити самоубиство, прекршити закон или бити жртве насиља. Алкохол је укључен у скоро једну трећину смртних случајева у саобраћају младих. Укупни годишњи трошкови пијења малолетника процењују се на 62 милијарде долара. Док је већина закона намијењена спречавању малољетног пијења усвојена на државном нивоу, на федералном нивоу је постојала законодавна активност и интерес за подршку напорима држава да обуздају проблем. Овај извештај описује степен употребе алкохола малолетника, недавне законодавне активности по овом питању и различите импликације политике. Биће ажуриран како нови подаци постану доступни. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Није политичко лобирање или јавна петиција резултирала реформом хране, већ грађански напор предвођен грађанима са моћи да заправо имплементирају и прате промене.<br/><br/>Завршио сам пост алудирајући на једно питање: Зашто нам је тако тешко да то урадимо сами, као појединци? Ако цела земља може да имплементира и шири заједнички поглед према храни, зашто ми не можемо?<br/><br/>Ништа нас не спречава да имитирамо успех Данске. Проблем је у томе што смо преплављени толико порука о томе шта треба да једемо и како треба да живимо, тешко је знати одакле да почнемо. Дакле, уместо да прате успешне оквире за које се показало да раде (као што је Манифест Нордиц Фоод), већина људи скаче од лудила за исхраном до лудила за исхраном, покушавајући да пронађу "прави начин да једу".<br/><br/>Али како је Цлаус Меиер успео? Који је био тајни сос који је помогао Манифесту? И да ли је разумно мислити да те лекције можемо применити на наше животе?
