Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Навигација порука<br/><br/>"Живот без докумената" освојио награду за најбоље писање<br/><br/>Пројекат блога "Живот без папира", који је креирао Лен Грант, садржи приче о породицама миграната без докумената и младим људима. Мигранти без докумената немају ништа. Не смеју да раде. Немају право на државне бенефиције нити на мјесто за живот. Они су невидљива и потенцијално најугроженија група у Великој Британији данас.<br/><br/>Недокументовани (или нерегуларни) мигранти укључују оне којима се тргује у сексуалној трговини или за домаће ропство; они укључују визе прекорачења; они чији су захтеви за азил одбијени и други који су били предмет неуспјеха у имиграционом систему. Све ово је можда првобитно дошло у Уједињено Краљевство легално.<br/><br/>"Илегални имигранти" - они за које се замишљало да су ушли у земљу на леђима камиона - чине мали део оних који немају документа.<br/><br/>Заиста, неки извори сугеришу да је половина процењених 120.000 недокументованих деце у Великој Британији заправо рођена овде од недокументованих родитеља. Ова деца су у неповољном положају од рођења, искључиво због њиховог имиграционог статуса.<br/><br/>Блог говори о причама недокументованих. Наглашава њихове дневне борбе и рањивости, али и њихову снагу и отпорност. Није лако читати.<br/><br/>Блогу можете приступити преко наше веб странице (десна колона на дну на почетној страници).<br/><br/>Блог је освојио онлајн категорију медијске награде Speaking Together. Награде су биле нови додатак ове године на прослави доделе награда Мигранткиња и избеглица године у Роиал Фестивал Халл у Лондону у склопу Међународног дана жена. Судски панел - укључујући романописца и драмског писца Џилијан Слово, и новинара и аутора, Хана Пул - посебно је тражио рад који оспорава митове и стереотипе.<br/><br/>Блог је такође освојио Blog North Awards 2013 у категорији најбољег писања, а такође је био у ужи избор за награду Амнести Интернатионал Медиа. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Сабат Школа Лекција<br/><br/>У Галатима, Павле се бави питањима као што су слобода, улога закона у спасењу, наше стање у Христу, и природа Духом вођеног живота, као и вековно питање, Како се грешни људи могу направити право пред светим и праведним Богом?<br/><br/>Многи научници верују да Галатима може бити најранији од Павлових писама. То је написано у АД 49, убрзо након чувеног Јерусалимског сабора (Дела 15). Стога, књига може бити најстарији познати хришћански документ. Као што Дела и Галатима јасно показују, рана црква се нашла у жестокој борби око природе спасења, посебно у случају незнабожаца. Према групи јеврејских верника, познатих као јудаисти, вера у Исуса није била довољна за незнабошце. Незнабошци такође морају бити обрезани и следити Мојсијеве законе (Дела 15:1).<br/><br/>Водич за проучавање Библије у овој четвртини позива нас да путујемо са апостолом Павлом док он моли Галатима да остану верни Исусу. Такође нам даје прилику да размислимо о сопственом разумевању истина које су отвориле пут за Мартин Лутхеров коначни раскид са Римом и обнову библијског еванђеља. |

Фредерик се сматрао популарним и интелигентним, током своје владавине, заједно са својом прелепом супругом, Цхарлотте, културни живот у малом граду достигао је свој зенит. Толико песника и уметника је провело своје време тамо да је Хилдбургхаузен добио надимак Клеин-Веимар, када је последњи војвода Саксо-Гота-Алтенбург умро без проблема 1825. године, остале гране куће одлучиле су о преуреди Ернестинских војводстава.

Жан Пол Фридрих Рихтер је свој роман Титан посветио четворици лепих, Шарлот је одрасла у Хановеру, где је њен отац служио као гувернер, у име његовог зета, краља Џорџа III од Уједињеног Краљевства, који је живео у Лондону. Када је Шарлота имала дванаест година, њена мајка је умрла и одгајила је њена сестра, Шарлота, која се удала за њеног оца 1784. године, а њене сестре је довела њена бака, Марија Лујза Албертина од Лејнинген-Фалкенбург-Дагсбурга у Дармштату. 3. септембра 1785. године, у петнаестој години, удала се за војводу Фридриха, војводу од Саксоније-Алтенбурга, брак није био срећан, Шарлота је била ментално супериорнија од Фридриха, који ју је почео игнорисати. Такође су имали проблема, Саксо-Хилдбургхаузен је био финансијски уништен катастрофалном политиком Фредерикових претходника. Примаоци су дозволили војводи и војвоткињи само смањену Цивилну листу, Шарлотин отац и два брата често су остали са Шарлотом у Хилдбургхаузену. 1787. године, она се трајно преселила у Хилдбургхаузен и постала председник кредитног одбора. Године 1792, Шарлотина бака и њене сестре су побегле пред напредујућом француском војском из Дармштата у Хилдбургхаузен, а њена бака је приметила Шарлотиног мужа.

Шарлот, која никада није волела овог човека, увек је трудна, породица је провела неколико безбрижних недеља у Хилдбургхаузену. 1793. године, Шарлотина бака се вратила из егзила и путовала са Шарлотиним сестрама у Франкфурт на Мајни, Шарлота је имала веома интимну и љубавну везу са својом сестром Фридериком и рођацима у Стрелицу. Године 1803. и 1805. пруски краљевски пар је посетио Хилдбургхаузен, за ову прилику, примаоци су дозволили војводском пару да обнови неки од свог намештаја. Лоуисе је помогла у изради објаве рата, хришћанин Труцхсесс вон Ветзхаусен зу Беттенбург био је пријатељ војводског пара и кум Шарлотовог сина Едварда. Многи гледаоци су дошли да виде баварску принцезу, када је примио своје госте, Трухсесс је покушао да доведе Шарлот у свој замак, али је она одбила, позивајући се на своју ћерку. Трухсес је одговорио: „Ваше Височанство ће ми опростити, али све док је овај дворац стајао овде, Тереза је затим зграбила бароне за другу руку, а њих тројица су заједно прошли кроз капију.“ Војвоткиња је дала око половине свог прихода сиромашнима, пензионерима.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Принц Чарлс од Хесен-Касела<br/>–<br/>Принц Чарлс од Хесен-Касела био је кадетски члан династије Хесен-Касел и дански генерал-фелдмаршал. Одрастао је са рођацима на данском двору, већину живота провео је у Данској, а његова мајка је била ћерка краља Џорџа II од Велике Британије и Каролине од Ансбаха и сестра краљице Лујзе од Данске. Његов отац, будући ландгроф, напустио је породицу 1747. године, а 1755. године формално је прекинуо брак са Маријом. Деда, Вилијам VIII, ландгроф од Хесена, дао је округу Ханау и његове приходе Марији, младом принцу Чарлсу и његова два брата, Вилијаму и Фредерику, одгајала је њихова мајка и неговали су их протестантски рођаци од 1747. године. Године 1756, Мери се преселила у Данску, да се брине о малолетној деци своје сестре, краљице Лујзе од Данске. Са њом је одвела своје синове који су одрасли на двору у палати Цхристиансборг у Копенхагену. Хесенски принчеви су касније остали у Данској, постајући њени важни господари, само се најстарији брат Вилијам вратио у Хесен, 1785. године, након успона на ландгрофство. Године 1758. именован је за пуковника, у доби од 20 година генерал-мајора, такође 1766. године, именован је за генерал-гувернера Норвешке, положај који је држао до 1768. године, али који је остао углавном титуларни, јер никада није отишао у Норвешку током овог периода. Године 1763, његов старији брат Вилијам се оженио својим првим рођаком, Чарлс је следио његов пример 30. августа 1766. године у палати Кристијанборг - његова супруга је била Луиза од Данске, а Чарлс је тако постао зет његовог рођака, краља Кристијана VII. Брак је одржан упркос савету који је дат против њега, због оптужби за разврат од стране принца Чарлса. Убрзо након тога, Чарлс је пао у неугодност на двору, а почетком 1767. године он и они су имали своје прво дете, Марие Софие, тамо 1767. године, а затим њихово друго дете, Виллиам, 1769. године. Године 1768, Чарлс је купио имовину и село Оффенбацх-Румпенхеим од породице Еделсхеим. У 1771 је имао имање проширен у дворац и кнежевско седиште и његова мајка Марија је живела у палати до своје смрти у 1772. Године 1781, Чарлс је продао палату Румпенхајм свом млађем брату, а Чарлс се настанио у замку Готорп у Шлезвигу са својом породицом. Тамо су имали своје треће дете Фридрих 1771. године, а 1770. краљ Кристијан VII је својој сестри дао имање Тегелхоф у Губију између града Шлезвига и Екернфердеа. Од 1772. до 1776. године, Чарлс је имао летњу резиденцију изграђену на месту које је назвао Лујзенлунд у част своје супруге, у септембру 1772. године, Чарлс је постављен за главнокомандујућег норвешке војске и он и Лујза су се преселили у Кристијану. Додељивање је било последица државног удара шведског краља Густава III 19. августа 1772. године, док је у Норвешкој принцеза Лујза родила њихово четврто дете Јулиане 1773. године.<br/><br/>Осамнаест.<br/>Луиза Каролина од Хесен-Касела<br/>–<br/>Лујза Каролина је рођена у Готорпу у Војводству Шлезвиг у породици ландгрофа Карла од Хесе-Касела и његове супруге принцезе Лујзе од Данске.

Хју је проглашен грофом, али није могао да надвлада Роберта, војводу Нормандије, у Инвеституре спору између Хенрија IV, Светог римског цара, и папе Григорија VII, Азо је покушао да посредује, али касније се придружио страни папе. Око 1073. године направио је замак у Естеу своју резиденцију, из које је Кућа Есте, пре његовог грађевинског пројекта, Есте била нешто више од села. Његов син Велф се преселио прво у Корушку, а затим у Баварску, што је довело до једне од најважнијих породица у европској историји, а други син, Фулк I од Милана, направио је прву документовану употребу титуле Маркуис дЕсте.

У складу са Хенријевим наређењима, он се одрекао и развео од своје војвоткиње Етелинде и овај догађај се догодио у Гослару 1070. године, када су се државе Баварске тихо предале новонасталом војводи, који је био представник једне од најстаријих породица у покрајини.

Хенри је, као последица поновљених побуњеничких аката, прогласио Велфа свргнутим у свом недавно стеченом војводству. Међутим, уз подршку својих верних Бавараца и уз помоћ свог оца у Италији, Велф је успео да задржи своје место, међутим, Григорије је умро 1085. године и његови наследници су мање интензивно учествовали у пословима Немачке.

Након смрти његовог оца Аза 1097. године, Велф је покушао да стекне очеву имовину јужно од Алпа, 1099. године, Велф се придружио ономе што ће постати познато као крсташки рат 1101. године, заједно са Вилијамом IX од Аквитаније, Хугом од Вермандоиса и Идом од Аустрије. Његов главни успех је био да спречи сукоб између других крсташа, који су пљачкали византијску територију на путу за Цариград, Велф је побегао од фијаска, али је умро на путу назад у Пафосу на Кипру 1101. године и сахрањен је у опатији Вајнгартен.

Настојао је да наследи свог свекра као саксонски војвода када је Магнус умро без наследника 1106. године. Ипак, војвода Хенри је одржавао блиске односе са владајућом салијанском династијом, 1116. године, придружио се цару Хенрију против друге италијанске кампање да заузме имања покојне маркизе Матилде од Тоскане.

То је далеко од КСНУМКС-а и нешто што смо дјеца увек имали у граду !!! Хубби не смета. На овај начин добија све доброте које нису дате!<br/><br/>КСНУМКС-а<br/>Коментари:<br/><br/>Синоћ је била Ноћ вештица и нисмо имали деце на вратима.<br/><br/>Ноћ вештица се овде не слави. Власници продавница покушавају да га промовишу оглашавањем и продајом разне опреме за Ноћ вештица, али то уопште не ухвати. У ствари, постоји отпор према томе од стране многих.<br/><br/>Забавите се за Ноћ вештица! сада је 6:30 и још увек нисмо имали никакав трик или третман. вечерас имам "детаљ слаткиша". мој муж вечерас води тц око комшилука.<br/><br/>дајемо мини чоколадне шипке и Цостцо микс слаткиша (лизалице, слатке пите, тоотсие ролне и слично). имамо неку гуму за грубу децу која не кажу трик или третирају, молим вас или хвала (нормаллих старији тинејџери). тако сам зла. Ако нису љубазни према мени, онда добију један мали слаткиш. Надамо се да неће касније те ноћи да нам напуне кућу. |
| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Пратите нас<br/><br/>Јеси ли ти<br/><br/>ИНСИДЕР<br/><br/>Жудња за шећером? Ево шта ваше тело покушава да вам каже<br/><br/>Џејмс<br/>Бирдие<br/><br/>ФОТО:<br/><br/>Јацкуемус<br/><br/>Повећање телесне тежине од неконтролисаних жеља може бити фрустрирајуће имати сталну жудњу за нечим нездравим и не знате зашто. Добра вест је да обично постоји разлог који лежи у тој горућој жељи да се смјести врећа чипса, или осјећај да бисте заправо могли умрети ако не добијете краставац у овом тренутку (чак и ако нисте трудни). Ако имате визије Млечног пута барова, на пример, то би могло значити да вам недостаје веома специфичан хранљиви састојак у вашој исхрани. (Да - то је компликованије од поменуте чоколаде бар је тако проклето укусно.)<br/><br/>Разговарали смо са дијететичаром из Лос Анђелеса Схира Ленцхевски, М.С., Р.Д., како би добили мршав на неким уобичајеним жудњама за храном, као и шта можете учинити да заситите глад без преласка преко брода. Наставите да се померате за неке озбиљно добре информације!<br/><br/>Ако желите чоколаду<br/><br/>То значи: Можда вам недостаје магнезијум у исхрани, каже Ленцхевски. "Магнезијум је есенцијални минерал укључен у производњу енергије, метаболизам глукозе и функцију мишића. Ово је посебно тачно за оне који ударају у теретану тешко", објашњава она. Поред тога, нивои магнезијума се смањују током предменструалних недеља вашег периода, што објашњава зашто ПМС тако често долази са чоколадним жудњама.<br/><br/>Уместо тога, посегните за висококвалитетном тамном чоколадом са ниским садржајем шећера, која је природно висока у магнезијуму. "Препоручујем да се држите 75 процената какаоа или више, и упарите га са другим извором богатим магнезијумом као што су семена сунцокрета", каже Ленцхевски. Она предлаже бренд чоколаде Ху, компанију за храну мале серије која се фокусира на висококвалитетне састојке који се производе локално. "То је мало скупо, али још више разлога да се делови држе под контролом", каже она. "То је мој лични фаворит." Такође смо велики љубитељи суперхране Зенбунни.<br/><br/>Ако сте жељни слаткиша<br/><br/>То значи: "Жеља за чистим шећером је добар показатељ да вам недостаје енергије", каже Ленцхевски. "Размислите о томе. Шта је једина ствар за коју чешљате након страшног ноћног сна или око 4 сата у току стресног радног дана? Одговор је обично шећер, јер се користи као тренутно гориво за ћелије нашег тела.<br/><br/>Уместо тога, посегните за јабуке са маслацем од ораха. "Ако раидинг слаткиша залиха ваших сарадника, препоручујем више споро гори угљених хидрата са извором масти или протеина", каже Ленцхевски. За разлику од једноставног шећера, ово ће подстаћи ваше ћелије док избегавате пад након шећера. Две опције које чине одличне пицк-ме-упс следећи пут када сте жељни слаткиша: нарезана јабука са вашим избором маслаца од ораха, или бобице са 2% незаслађеног грчког јогурта. Волимо да разбијамо слатки зуб са овим заразним кокосовим чиповима - они су пуњење, без икаквог додатог шећера и тако добро.<br/><br/>Ако сте жељни соли<br/><br/>То значи: "Ако ништа осим најсланији краставац ће учинити, можда нећете пити довољно Х2О", каже Ленцхевски. "Соли помаже тијелу да се држи воде, тако да га жудимо када смо у потреби течности."<br/><br/>Уместо тога, посегните за водом. "Останите хидрирани, поготово док се приближавамо летњим месецима", каже она. Следећи пут када жудња удари, покушајте да га угасите (буквално) са неколико освежавајућих чаша и можда ћете пронаћи хитност натријумског пијанства. "Ако вам обична вода досади, покушајте да додате менту, лимун или замрзнуто воће да бисте га помешали", каже Ленцхевски. А ако то и даље не ради трик, постоји здравија алтернатива врећама чипса или помфрита. "Ако сте заиста само жуди за сољу, на крају крајева, тост морске алге је одлична ниско-калорична опција", каже она.<br/><br/>Ако сте жељни скробних угљених хидрата као тестенине<br/><br/>То значи: "Будући да храна са високим садржајем угљених хидрата повећава хормон серотонин, жеља за скроба може бити знак да вам је потребан појачавач расположења", каже Ленцхевски.<br/><br/>Уместо тога, посегните за купањем! "Избаците соли Епсома, јер је време за неки озбиљан Р + Р", каже Ленцхевски. "Верујте ми. Упуштање у скроб бесплатно за све осећа се заиста добро у овом тренутку, али ће вас вероватно избацити више следећег дана." (Као што зна свако ко је икада претерано уживао у жељи за пиззом или тестенинама.) Дакле, следећи пут када желите прво да зароните главу у посуду са угљеним хидратима, нацртајте купку, запалите свећу и третирајте се без икаквог жаљења или густих калорија.<br/><br/>Ако сте жељни сладоледа<br/><br/>КСНУМКС / КСНУМКС<br/><br/>То значи: "Ваше тело вам може рећи да му је потребна нека здрава маст."<br/><br/>Уместо тога, посегните за кокосов сладолед. "Ја сам реалиста, па ако жуде за сладолед, нећу препоручити шачицу ораха, који су, наравно, пуни здраве масти", каже Ленцхевски. "За хитне случајеве сладоледа, препоручујем сладолед са нижим садржајем шећера као што је Цоцонут Блисс или Киппи'с сладолед са три састојка у Лос Анђелесу." Можемо гарантовати за чињеницу да сладолед од кокоса има невероватан укус и баш као права ствар.<br/><br/>Ако желиш хамбургер<br/><br/>То значи: Потребно вам је гвожђе. "Ако не можете да престанете да размишљате о црвеном месу, постоји шанса да ваше тело жуди за гвожђем, б12 и фолном киселином", каже Ленцхевски. "Ово је посебно тачно током или око тог времена у месецу."<br/><br/>Уместо тога, посегните за здравијим хамбургером. "Ја сам заговорник траве, антибиотика и црвеног меса без хормона једном недељно", каже Ленцхевски. "Покушајте да експериментишете са бизонским хамбургером са отвореним лицем - који је, за резање, виткији и има више гвожђа од говедине." Не једите месо? Покушајте да укључите неку врсту додатка гвожђа на биљној бази у вашу рутину, као што је спирулина. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Веб сервиси, продавци и сајбер закони!<br/><br/>Ажурирано:Април 21, 2014Билал Ахмад<br/><br/>Компјутеризација овог света променио сценарио људских перформанси у великој мери и да превише изван мерења. На пример, Сада можете послати виталне информације широм света са једним кликом миша, захваљујући интернет конекције. Нажалост, то је ова широка повезаност и популарност међу људима, интернет је такође повећао шансе за компјутерске злочине. Интернет злочини или компјутерски злочини су широко познати као "Цибер Цримес".<br/><br/>'Цибер закони' је нешто ново у правосудном систему, али је стекао много пажње у последње време. Термин сајбер криминал је нешто веома синоним за конвенционални криминал, једина разлика је средство извршења. Постоје углавном две врсте сајбер криминала, прва је у којој су рачунари главне мете и то укључују случајеве оштећења података, злонамерног кода, па чак и приступа криминалним подацима. Друга је у којој је рачунар само алат којим се користе конвенционални злочини почињени нпр. за сајбер тероризам, спам, сајбер ухођење и још много тога.<br/><br/>Ово је место где вебсајт консултант или продавац долази на сцену. Иако нису свјесни свих сајбер закона присутних до данас, продавац веб страница може вас савјетовати о неким од најважнијих сајбер закона приликом креирања вашег сајта.<br/><br/>Ово може укључивати заједничко знање о правима копирања или чак заштити садржаја сопствене веб странице. Објашњавање свих права која поседујете као власник веб странице је такође један од задатака које продавац веб странице може да уради приликом развоја ваше веб странице. Продавац вам такође може помоћи нудећи вам информације о различитим сајбер законима за заштиту података. Поред свега тога, продавац вам такође може понудити информације о било ком новом сајбер закону који можда нисте свесни док не знате. Цибер закони могу варирати од нације до нације, један недавни пример може бити закон о колачићима објављен у Уједињеном Краљевству, који спречава веб локацију да сачува било какве податке о прегледању корисника. Према Закону о колачићима, веб странице у Великој Британији не могу сачувати датотеке колачића без информативне сагласности сурфера.<br/><br/>Тек након имплементације таквог закона, веб странице сада имају поп-уп прозор, који тражи сагласност посетиоца за чување датотека колачића. Такве датотеке веб-сајтови користе за анализу обрасца прегледања посетилаца на основу којих се огласи затим објављују у корисничком прозору. Са хаковањем више није нова ствар за све нас, да ли мислите да таква правила и прописи могу спречити онлине фалсификовање или сајбер криминал? Технологија се развила брзом стопом, али и даље људи не преферирају куповину на мрежи због страха од личних или банковних рачуна који су хаковани. Са порастом сајбер криминала, потреба за строгим сајбер законима такође се повећала како би се обуздало исто и промовисало искуство куповине без ризика.<br/><br/>Класе сајбер криминала<br/><br/>Током година постојале су три главне класе сајбер криминала:<br/><br/>Неовлашћени приступ рачунарским системима, који укључује хаковање или крађу корисничких имена и лозинки за приступ личним подацима одговарајућег корисника.
