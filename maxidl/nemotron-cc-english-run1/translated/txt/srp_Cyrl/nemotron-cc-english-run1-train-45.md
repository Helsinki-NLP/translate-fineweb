| Political Selling 101<br/><br/>Written by Dave Stein<br/><br/>Note: To see charts in this article, view it on  Most people who have been selling for even a short period of time understand that some level of corporate politics is present in every organization into which they sell. As sales professionals' experience and political savvy increases, so does what they observe in their accounts. If you aren't aware of political activity in your accounts, it doesn't mean that it isn't there. It just means you can't see it and certainly can't leverage it. If your competitor is politically savvy, you are at a distinct disadvantage. What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster one definition is, "competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership." Winners have developed a set of skills that enables them to consistently succeed because of, or in spite of, politics. They've learned to select right competing interest groups and then ride power and leadership wave to success by devising and executing political strategies for each key influencer and decision maker. Being adept politically will rarely lead to a win by itself. There are many other components to winning. But to not understand and take advantage of interpersonal forces within an account is to leave assets unleveraged. Here are some of key skills required to elevate yourself into realm of political selling: Skill: A basic understanding of how corporate politics works. For our purposes, politics and influence are synonymous. People need help of other people to achieve certain business goals (i.e. my department's project gets funded) as well as business-driven personal goals (i.e. if it is successful, I get a raise--I can afford that new house). Within a company, it works something like this: "If you report to me I can just tell you to do something and you will do it." That's SAY-SO influence. You'll do it because I say so. But if you don't work for me--let's say you work in another department--it becomes more difficult. I then have to influence you to help me. I'll use POLITICAL influence. That requires a combination of skills and artistry and it takes time and strategy. Here is an example: Let's say that we both work for same company, but for different departments. If I need your help for my department to achieve its quarterly objectives, I might look for ways in which I can help you achieve your objectives (ideally, business and personal objectives) and subtly advertise those to you as benefits of helping me. In that way we are aligned with a set of common interdependent purposes. Win-win. When you are selling into a company, you have absolutely no SAY-SO over buyer. You can't tell anyone in your customer's company what to do. You can only influence them to give you information, insights, coaching and preference so that they influence others to look at you and your offering favorably. The best way to influence someone is to clearly communicate how and by how much you will contribute to advancement of their business and (business-related) personal goals. In diagram below, you'll see that when you can help a buyer or influencer meet their personal and business goals (Quadrant 1), you're much more likely to gain commitment from them in helping you win. In Quadrant 2, there is no personal win, so their commitment, although altruistic so far as a contribution to their company, will not be supported as strongly. Stay away from people in Quadrant 3. In those cases, person you are selling to is "in it for themselves," acting counter to what is in best interests of their company. You run risk of not only losing deal, but being associated with "dirty politics," which could affect your personal and your company's reputation. Quadrant 4 reminds you that if you find you can't contribute to person achieving their business or personal goals, your likelihood of gaining their support is minimal. Don't turn these people into enemies, but focus your efforts on finding and selling to influencers in first quadrant. Skill: The ability to see what's invisible As I suggested earlier, not everyone is skilled enough to observe sophisticated corporate politicians being influential. Savvy politicians do their thing privately. It's not unlike backroom deals done by government politicians. How do you know that there is influence being wielded? First, assume it is. Then begin to look at results and work backward. We can extract a good example from everyday government politics: If there is "pork"--say $650.3 million in corporate tax benefits for igloo manufacturers in Alaska--embedded in a House of Representatives education bill, you can quickly figure out who lent a hand getting it through committee. Ask your contacts within your customer's company or government department about prior purchases, projects and initiatives. Find out who sponsored them, whose budgets paid for them, who were ultimate decision makers and who benefited in some more personal ways. The names you come up with will likely be people of influence, either through their command of an organization, or through astute politicking. They are ones for whose influence you will be positioning during your sales campaign. Skill: Connecting dots You've done some discovery and have begun to make associations. When you asked about recent projects, several people referenced Carrie Miehome, who works in IT organization. She deftly led steering committee with CRM project last year. Funny thing though, that project was put ahead of others that already had funding. Why would that be, you might ask? Who benefits from a CRM implementation? The VP of Sales? The VP of Customer Service? Perhaps CFO who wants more visibility into revenue stream... It's perfectly reasonable to expect that she was influenced by a higher power. The challenge will be finding out whom, what was in it for them and what was in it for her if you are selling IT solutions to that company. Skill: Knowing how to map out organization You'll need to start with an organization chart. If they won't give you one, you can build one by getting answers to pointed questions about reporting structure, by reading information on web and, if your customer is a public company, from corporate SEC filings.<br/><br/>Why Write a Sales Letter for Each Product?<br/><br/>Authors/publishers are great at getting their books written. Entrepreneurs know their products. But after initial one-year honeymoon, sales slow down. To counter this make sure your ebook, product, or service you offer will keep on selling from first day, first year, even for life. Write a short sales letter for each product or ebook.<br/><br/>Whether you have a Web site or not, you can write a first class, must-buy-now sales letter. Write one for each teleclass, eBook, product, or service. I even write one for my bookcoaching services.<br/><br/>If you are like me and have a Web site, it is content driven. Why? Because that's why people come to any site--to get free information. You must also give them a reason to buy. Most home pages say too much about author or book instead of intriguing their potential buyers with a benefit- driven headline, which in turns leads them to benefits of their books--the sales letter.<br/><br/>My first Web site had many fine books and kits in personal growth and book writing and marketing. Sales never went over $200 a month. To correct that, I created a new site and paid special attention to its sales language (without hype) for each teleclass, eBook, and book coaching opportunities to suit each income and need. Sales were $75 first month, and in four months they reached $2265. The next year they went around $3000 a month.<br/><br/>What Every Sales Letter Needs to Pull Orders and Profits<br/><br/>You can write each sales letter in less than four hours first time. As you practice, you can write them in two hours.<br/><br/>1. Start Letter with a Benefit-Driven Headline.<br/><br/>Include these headlines throughout your sales letter. "Want a quick and easy way to quadruple your Online Income in Four Months?<br/><br/>If you answered, "yes" to yourself, headline succeeds, because you will keep reading. If you said "No, I don't believe this, " but I'm curious where this is going," headline still succeeds. You win when your headline seduces your potential customer to read on in your sales letter to discover your product[']s benefits and features, some fine testimonials, and finally to click "buy now" which takes them to order page.<br/><br/>2. List Top Five Benefits of your Product or Service in bullet form.<br/><br/>To define your top benefits start with a list of problems your client or customer wants solutions for. Each specific problem you answer can be labeled a benefit. If you are not rock sure of who your audience is, your sales copy dribbles away and doesn't meet its target. Keep redefining your audience and know as much about them as you can.<br/><br/>Remember that one benefit is top undeniable benefit—usually more money easier, more clients faster, more profits from Web sales, better relationships, and health.<br/><br/>If you have more than five benefits collected in a list, sprinkle rest throughout your copy. How will your book make someone's life easier, richer in time or money, help their personal growth, provide additional income, entertain them? How will your product or service make them a better business person, more attractive, feel better, avoid catastrophe, sickness, or surgery?<br/><br/>3. Address your Potential Buyer's Resistances.<br/><br/>Remember to tell a background story of where they are NOW so they will emotionally connect with your solutions (the product or service). Let's say they want to write an eBook or print book to make themselves "expert," make life-long passive income, or share their unique message. | Продаја 101<br/><br/>Написао Дејв Стајн<br/><br/>Напомена: Да бисте видели графиконе у овом чланку, погледајте га на Већина људи који продају чак и за кратак временски период разумеју да је неки ниво корпоративне политике присутан у свакој организацији у којој продају. Како се искуство продајних професионалаца и политичка памет повећавају, тако и оно што примећују на својим рачунима. Ако нисте свјесни политичких активности на својим рачунима, то не значи да их нема. То само значи да га не можете видети и свакако га не можете искористити. Ако је ваш конкурент политички паметан, ви сте у јасном неповољном положају. Шта је политика? Према Мерриам-Вебстер-у, једна дефиниција је "конкуренција између конкурентских интересних група или појединаца за моћ и лидерство." Победници су развили скуп вештина које им омогућавају да доследно успију због или упркос политици. Научили су да бирају праве конкурентске интересне групе, а затим возе талас моћи и лидерства до успеха осмишљавањем и извршавањем политичких стратегија за сваког кључног утицајника и доносиоца одлука. Бити политички вешт ће ретко довести до победе сама по себи. Постоји много других компоненти за победу. Али да не разумеју и искористе интерперсоналне силе унутар рачуна је да остави имовину без полуге. Ево неких од кључних вештина потребних за подизање себе у домену политичке продаје: Вештина: Основно разумевање како корпоративна политика функционише. За наше сврхе, политика и утицај су синоними. Људима је потребна помоћ других људи да би постигли одређене пословне циљеве (тј. Пројекат мог одељења се финансира), као и пословно вођене личне циљеве (тј. Ако је успјешан, добијам повишицу - могу приуштити ту нову кућу). Унутар компаније, то функционише овако: "Ако ми пријавите, могу вам рећи да урадите нешто и ви ћете то урадити." То је САИ-СО утицај. Урадићете то зато што ја то кажем. Али ако не радите за мене - рецимо да радите у другом одељењу - постаје теже. Онда морам да утичем на вас да ми помогнете. Користићу ПОЛИТИЧКИ утицај. То захтева комбинацију вештина и умјетности и потребно је време и стратегија. Ево примера: Рецимо да обоје радимо за исту компанију, али за различите одељења. Ако ми је потребна ваша помоћ за моје одељење да постигне своје кварталне циљеве, можда ћу тражити начине на које могу да вам помогнем да постигнете своје циљеве (идеално, пословне и личне циљеве) и суптилно оглашавате оне вама као користи од помоћи. На тај начин смо усклађени са скупом заједничких међузависних сврха. Вин-вин. Када продајете у компанију, немате апсолутно САИ-СО над купцем. Не можете никоме у компанији вашег купца рећи шта да ради. Можете само утицати на њих да вам дају информације, увиде, тренирање и преференције тако да утичу на друге да вас и вашу понуду гледају повољно. Најбољи начин да утичете на некога је да јасно комуницирате како и колико ћете допринети унапређењу њиховог пословања и (пословних) личних циљева. У дијаграму испод, видећете да када можете помоћи купцу или инфлуенцеру да испуни своје личне и пословне циљеве (Квадрант 1), много је вероватније да ћете добити посвећеност од њих у помагању да победите. У Квадранту 2 нема личне победе, тако да њихова посвећеност, иако алтруистична колико је то допринос њиховој компанији, неће бити подржана тако снажно. Држите се даље од људи у Квадранту 3. У тим случајевима, особа којој продајете је "у њему за себе", дјелујући супротно ономе што је у најбољем интересу њихове компаније. Ризикујете не само да изгубите посао, већ и да будете повезани са "прљавом политиком", што би могло утицати на вашу личну и репутацију ваше компаније. Квадрант 4 вас подсећа да ако откријете да не можете допринијети особи која постиже своје пословне или личне циљеве, ваша вјероватноћа да добијете њихову подршку је минимална. Не претварајте ове људе у непријатеље, већ фокусирајте своје напоре на проналажење и продају инфлуенцерима у првом квадранту. Вештина: Способност да се види шта је невидљиво Као што сам раније предложио, нису сви довољно вешти да посматрају софистициране корпоративне политичаре као утицајне. То није за разлику од бацкроом аранжмана које обављају владини политичари. Како знате да постоји утицај који се користи? Прво, претпоставите да јесте. Онда почните да гледате резултате и радите уназад. Можемо извући добар пример из свакодневне политике владе: Ако постоји "свињетина" - рецимо 650,3 милиона долара у пореским олакшицама за произвођаче иглуа на Аљасци - уграђена у закон о образовању Представничког дома, можете брзо схватити ко је пружио руку да га добије кроз одбор. Питајте своје контакте у компанији или владином одељењу вашег клијента о претходним куповинама, пројектима и иницијативама. Сазнајте ко их је спонзорисао, чији буџети су их плаћали, који су били крајњи доносиоци одлука и који су имали користи на неки личнији начин. Имена која ћете смислити вероватно ће бити људи утицаја, било кроз њихову команду организације, или кроз лукаво политичарење. Они су они чији утицај ћете позиционирати током ваше продајне кампање. Вештина: Повезивање тачака Урадили сте нека открића и почели сте да правите асоцијације. Када сте питали о недавним пројектима, неколико људи је споменуло Царрие Миехоме, која ради у ИТ организацији. Прошле године је вешто водила управљачки одбор са ЦРМ пројектом. Смешно је, међутим, да је пројекат стављен испред других који су већ имали средства. Зашто би то било, питате? Ко има користи од имплементације ЦРМ-а? ВП продаје? Потпредседник службе за кориснике? Можда финансијски директор који жели већу видљивост у проток прихода... Сасвим је разумно очекивати да је била под утицајем више силе. Изазов ће бити да сазнате ко, шта је било у њему за њих и шта је било за њу ако продајете ИТ решења тој компанији. Вештина: Знање како мапирати организацију Мораћете да почнете са организационом графиконом. Ако вам не дају један, можете га изградити тако што ћете добити одговоре на истакнута питања о структури извештавања, читањем информација на вебу и, ако је ваш клијент јавна компанија, из корпоративних СЕК поднесака.<br/><br/>Зашто написати продајно писмо за сваки производ?<br/><br/>Аутори / издавачи су одлични у писању својих књига. Предузетници знају своје производе. Али након почетног једногодишњег меденог месеца, продаја се успорава. Да бисте се супротставили овоме, уверите се да ће ваша е-књига, производ или услуга коју нудите наставити да се продаје од првог дана, прве године, чак и за живот. Напишите кратко продајно писмо за сваки производ или е-књигу.<br/><br/>Без обзира да ли имате веб локацију или не, можете написати прву класу, морате купити продајно писмо. Напишите један за сваку телекласу, е-књигу, производ или услугу. Чак и пишем један за моје услуге књиговодства.<br/><br/>Ако сте попут мене и имате веб локацију, то је садржај. Зашто? Зато што људи долазе на било који сајт - да добију бесплатне информације. Такође им морате дати разлог за куповину. Већина почетних страница говори превише о аутору или књизи уместо да интригирају своје потенцијалне купце са насловом који их покреће, што их заузврат доводи до предности њихових књига - продајног писма.<br/><br/>Моја прва веб страница имала је много финих књига и комплета у личном расту и писању и маркетингу књига. Продаја никада није прелазила $ КСНУМКС месечно. Да бих то исправио, створио сам нову локацију и посветио посебну пажњу свом продајном језику (без хипеа) за сваку телекласу, е-књигу и могућности обуке књига како би одговарали сваком приходу и потреби. Продаја је била $ КСНУМКС први месец, а за четири месеца достигли су $ КСНУМКС. Следеће године су износили око 3.000 долара месечно.<br/><br/>Шта Свако Продајно Писмо Потребно Да Повуче Наруџбине И Профит<br/><br/>Прво можете написати свако продајно писмо за мање од четири сата. Док вежбате, можете их написати за два сата.<br/><br/>КСНУМКС. Почните писмо са насловом који покреће корист.<br/><br/>Укључите ове наслове кроз ваше продајно писмо. "Желите ли брз и једноставан начин да удвостручите свој онлине приход за четири мјесеца?<br/><br/>Ако сте одговорили "да" себи, наслов успева, јер ћете наставити да читате. Ако сте рекли "Не, не верујем ово, " али сам радознао где ово иде," наслов и даље успева. Побеђујете када ваш наслов заведе вашег потенцијалног купца да прочита у вашем продајном писму како бисте открили предности и функције вашег производа, неке фине препоруке и коначно кликните на "купи сада" што их води на страницу за наручивање.<br/><br/>КСНУМКС. Листа Топ пет предности вашег производа или услуге у облику метака.<br/><br/>Да бисте дефинисали своје врхунске користи, почните са листом проблема за које ваш клијент или купац жели рјешења. Сваки специфични проблем на који одговорите може се означити као корист. Ако нисте сигурни ко је ваша публика, ваша продајна копија одлази и не испуњава свој циљ. Наставите да редефинишете своју публику и знате што више о њима.<br/><br/>Запамтите да је једна од предности врхунска неоспорна корист - обично више новца лакше, више клијената брже, више профита од веб продаје, бољих односа и здравља.<br/><br/>Ако имате више од пет погодности прикупљених на листи, посипајте одмор кроз вашу копију. Како ће ваша књига олакшати нечији живот, богатији временом или новцем, помоћи њиховом личном расту, пружити додатни приход, забавити их? Како ће их ваш производ или услуга учинити бољом пословном особом, атрактивнијом, боље се осјећати, избјећи катастрофу, болест или операцију?<br/><br/>КСНУМКС. Адресирајте отпоре потенцијалног купца.<br/><br/>Не заборавите да испричате позадинску причу о томе где су сада, тако да ће се емоционално повезати са вашим решењима (производ или услуга). Рецимо да желе да напишу е-књигу или штампану књигу како би постали "стручњак", зарађивали доживотни пасивни приход или дијелили своју јединствену поруку. |

Salt is a preservative but it is also something that adds savor and enjoyment to our daily food. Light is a symbol of truth; it is comforting, penetrating, guiding and exposes darkness. We seek to preserve biblical truth and shed the glorious light of the Gospel in a world that is consumed by darkness.<br/><br/>Watch the webcast eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ABOUT THE VIDEO<br/><br/>God has given progressive revelations throughout the Bible and it is with this knowledge that we can deduce there was a creation prior to Adam. We don't know how long it lasted but Lucifer was an angel who led a rebellion in heaven and started a war that affected the entire universe. The earth was his planet and he ruled from Eden, the same place where God would later put Adam and Eve. As Lucifer's last stand, the earth would have been damaged and looked much like Berlin did at the end of World War II. This would explain why the Bible speaks about a re-creation and God's call to replenish the earth. Adam and Eve were thrown into the conflict to prove that God is righteous to the angelic world. The rewards are potentially enormous: eternal life and being joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>If there was indeed a pre-Adamic civilization with commerce and war, then you shouldn't be surprised when a new world order emerges in the future that calls for peace and offers membership to anyone who will take an oath of loyalty and receive an identification mark that will give you access to the new financial system.

Ми смо група верника усредсређена на Библију која жели да расте у пуном знању Исуса Христа без компромиса са Његовом Речју. Ми верујемо, подучавамо и практикујемо све оно што је Исус учио и што је Црква практиковала у књизи Дела апостолска. Исус је позвао своје ученике да буду со и светлост. Сол је конзерванс, али је и нешто што додаје укус и уживање у нашој свакодневној храни. Светлост је симбол истине; она је утешна, продире, води и разоткрива таму. Настојимо да сачувамо библијску истину и бацимо славно светло Јеванђеља у свет који је прожет тамом.<br/><br/>Погледајте вебцаст еаец.орг/вебцаст.хтм<br/><br/>О ВИДЕО<br/><br/>Бог је дао прогресивна откривења широм Библије и са овим знањем можемо закључити да је постојало стварање пре Адама. Не знамо колико дуго је трајало, али Луцифер је био анђео који је водио побуну на небу и започео рат који је утицао на цео универзум. Земља је била његова планета и он је владао из Едена, исто место где ће Бог касније ставити Адама и Еву. Као Луциферов последњи став, земља би била оштећена и изгледала би слично Берлину на крају Другог светског рата. Ово би објаснило зашто Библија говори о поновном стварању и Божијем позиву да попуни земљу. Адам и Ева су бачени у сукоб да би доказали да је Бог праведан анђеоском свету. Награде су потенцијално огромне: вечни живот и заједнички наследници са Исусом Христом.<br/><br/>Ако је заиста постојала пре-адамска цивилизација са трговином и ратом, онда не треба да се изненадите када се у будућности појави нови светски поредак који позива на мир и нуди чланство свакоме ко ће се заклети на лојалност и примити идентификациони знак који ће вам омогућити приступ новом финансијском систему.

| Post oak leaves have distinctive cross shape<br/><br/>So said the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray, on page 451 in his encyclopedic "Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology," a book published in 1872.<br/><br/>I got my copy at an old bookstore several years ago. I can't remember where exactly. The book is some 700 pages long, not including a series of gorgeous line drawings of sedges, grasses and ferns in the back. The pages feature fore edge marbling…a bit faded now… and the front and back covers are ornamented, with the monogram of the publishing house. They don't make books like this anymore.<br/><br/>Professor Gray was, of course, referring to what we have as this week's Mystery Plant, the post oak, Quercus stellata. I'm pretty confident that all you botanists out there will recognize this instantly as some sort of oak.<br/><br/>Post oak leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces.(Photo: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Oaks belong to the genus Quercus…and they are not always large trees. Some species, of course, are called "scrub oaks", which seems to me a bit of a botanical "put-down", and other species are good examples of shrubs, not more than about knee-high.<br/><br/>Here in the Southeast, we have about 45 native oak species, most of which can rather easily be differentiated into two groups: "White oaks" (including our Mystery Plant) have rounded lobes, without any points or bristles on the tips.<br/><br/>"Red oaks" feature sharply pointed lobes, each with a prominent bristle at the top. There are some other differences, too.<br/><br/>Post oak is widely distributed in the eastern USA, from southern New England through Missouri and Texas, and then east from there, including northern Florida. It is a deciduous species, producing pale, somewhat shreddy or scaly bark. Really large, old individuals can be over 60 feet tall, and because of this, they make great shade trees along city streets and in parks.<br/><br/>The acorns take one season to mature, and they are a valuable wildlife food source. What most people remember about this species are the leaves. The leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces. Generally, the leaves have a distinctive cross-shaped ("cruciform") look, with two major lobes projected more or less horizontally from the midrib.<br/><br/>The cross-shape is not always well-developed from individual to individual, however, especially is there has been any hybridization going on. (Oak species are famous for mixing it up with each other.)<br/><br/>And this is interesting: Professor Gray refers to this oak in his book by using an incorrect name. The correct and first valid name came about in 1787, penned by a German botanist named Friedrich von Wangenheim. But for some reason, Gray printed the name Quercus obtusiloba, which had been proposed by the French botanist, Andre Michaux. But Michaux was 15 years late — je regrette.<br/><br/>John Nelson is the curator of the A. C.

Не сећам се тачно где. Књига је дугачка око 700 страница, не укључујући серију прекрасних цртежа линија седла, траве и папрати у позадини. На страницама је предњи ивичњак... сада је мало избледео... а предњи и задњи поклопци су украшени, са монограмом издавачке куће. Више не праве овакве књиге.<br/><br/>Професор Греј је, наравно, говорио о ономе што имамо као овонедељну мистериозну биљку, пост храст, Quercus stellata. Прилично сам сигуран да ће сви ви ботаничари одмах препознати ово као неку врсту храста.<br/><br/>Листови храста су светло зелени и гребани на површинама. (Фотографија: Кеитх Брадлеи)<br/><br/>Храстови припадају роду Куерцус ... и они нису увек велика дрвећа. Неке врсте, наравно, називају се "храстови храстови", што ми се чини помало ботаничким "пут-довн", а друге врсте су добри примери грмља, не више од колена.<br/><br/>Овде на југоистоку имамо око 45 аутохтоних врста храста, од којих се већина лако може диференцирати у две групе: "Бели храстови" (укључујући и нашу мистериозну биљку) имају заобљене режњеве, без икаквих тачака или чекиња на врховима.<br/><br/>"Црвени храстови" имају оштро оштре режњеве, сваки са истакнутом чекињом на врху. Постоје и неке друге разлике.<br/><br/>Пост храст је широко распрострањен у источној САД, од јужне Нове Енглеске преко Мисурија и Тексаса, а затим источно одатле, укључујући и северну Флориду. То је листопадна врста, која производи бледу, донекле схредди или љускаву кору. Стварно велики, стари појединци могу бити високи преко 60 стопа, и због тога, они праве одличне дрвеће сенке дуж градских улица и у парковима.<br/><br/>Жодови трају једну сезону да сазри, а они су вриједан извор хране за дивље животиње. Оно што већина људи памти о овој врсти су листови. Листови су јарко зелени и огреботине на површинама. Генерално, листови имају карактеристичан изглед укрштеног облика, са два главна режња пројектована више или мање хоризонтално од средишњег ребра.<br/><br/>Унакрсни облик није увек добро развијен од појединца до појединца, међутим, посебно ако је дошло до хибридизације. (Врсте храста су познате по мешању једни са другима.)<br/><br/>И ово је интересантно: Професор Греј се у својој књизи односи на овај храст користећи погрешно име. Исправно и прво важеће име дошло је 1787. године, написано од стране немачког ботаничара по имену Фридрих вон Вангенхајм. Али из неког разлога, Греј је одштампао име Quercus obtusiloba, које је предложио француски ботаничар Андре Мишо. Али Мишо је каснио 15 година - је жао.<br/><br/>Џон Нелсон је кустос хербаријума А.
