| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Смит Чак - Кроз Библију Ц2000 серијеДа ли ћемо се обратити књизи Дела апостолска, поглавље 1, као што смо почели наше проучавање ране цркве.<br/>Лука, аутор књиге Дела, пратилац апостола Павла, који је такође био аутор Јеванђеља према Луки, написао је ова два трактата пријатељу, Теофилу. Теофил је грчко име. То је име које има прелепо значење. Име значи љубитељ Бога. Постоје неки који верују да то уопште није био човек, већ да су еванђеље и књига Дела упућени љубитељима Бога, ко год да сте. Постоје и друге традиције које кажу да је Теофил заправо био Лукин господар. Да су у то време лекари били робови, обично роб богатог покровитеља. Тако да је Лукин господар био Теофил, и ослободио је Луку да буде са Павлом на мисионарским путовањима. Тако Лука пише назад свом бившем господару. Ово је рана традиција цркве, али је, наравно, немогуће доказати, као и многе друге традиције.<br/>Има и оних који верују да кад је Павле био у Троади и примио виђење човека који му је дозвао говорећи: „Дођи у Македонију и помози нам“, да тај човек у Павловом виђењу није био нико други до Лука. Јер први који је Павле заиста срео када је дошао у Македонију био је Лука. И пошто смо у књизи Дела, видећете да када дођемо до тог дела књиге Дела, Лука почиње да пише више у првом лицу него у трећем лицу. Дакле, очигледно је да је у овом тренутку у Делима апостолским Лука постао сапутник Павла и почео да путује са њим. Он је почео да користи замене "ми" и "нас" уместо "они" и "они". Ово је, без сумње, место где је Лука постао учесник и очевидац оних ствари које су се од овог тренутка дешавале. Ми ћемо вам то изнети када дођемо до те тачке.<br/>Он почиње Дела апостолска везујући га са Јеванђељем према Луки. Занимљиво је да је последња ствар коју Лука бележи у свом еванђељу је прва ствар коју бележи у Делима апостолским. Проналазимо еванђеље Луке затвара док Исус говори својим ученицима да чекају у Јерусалиму док не буду обухваћени снагом одозго. А онда је Исус уздигао на небо, и тако затвара еванђеље. У отварању Дела апостолска, он пише,<br/>Написао сам ти, Теофиле, прву расправу о свему што је Исус почео да чини и поучава (Дела 1:1).<br/>Кључна реч је почела. Јеванђеље према Луки није пуна прича о служби Исуса Христа. То је само почетак службе Исуса Христа. Исус наставља да служи потребама људи. Исус наставља да лечи болесне. Исус наставља да васкрсава мртве. Исус наставља да служи Његовој љубави и Његовом еванђељу свету, тек сада Он служи кроз оне ученике који су помазани Његовим Светим Духом. Али Христова служба се наставља; у основи, то је премиса коју Лука узима у Делима апостолским. Претходна расправа о свему што је Исус почео, и да ради и да учи.<br/>Због тога су Дела апостолска незавршена књига: у њој Господ и данас наставља да делује кроз животе оних који су се посветили да буду оруђа Божија. Да буде вођен и вођен и помазан Његовим Светим Духом, да настави службу Исуса у свету данас. Сада је Бог наредио да Његов рад треба да се оствари кроз људске инструменте. Не кажем да то мора да се оствари. Бог може да користи анђеоска бића за Своје дело, и доћи ће време, током књиге Откривења, када ће Бог користити анђеле да објављују Своје еванђеље људима широм света. Откривење, поглавље 14, "Први анђео лети кроз средину неба имајући вечно еванђеље" (Откривење 14:6). Али у овом тренутку, Бог је изабрао да користи људске инструменте. Као несавршени као што могу бити, ипак, то је оно што је Бог наредио да користи. Узбудљива ствар у вези са тим је, Бог ће ме користити и Бог ће вас користити. Толико пута, ми смо молећи од, "О Господе, не могу да говорим. Никада нисам био у стању да говори пре или чак и сада, Господе." Као Мојсије покушао да моли од позива Бога. Јеремија је рекао: "Господе, ја сам само дете; нико ме неће слушати." И сви имамо своје изговоре зашто не можемо бити коришћени. Зар не? Сви знамо разлоге зашто Бог није могао да нас користи.<br/>Једном, док је Господ звао пророка да учини Свој посао, рекао је: „Господе, пошаљи кога хоћеш.“ Господ је рекао: „Хеј, звао сам те.“ „Господе, добра идеја, пошаљи кога хоћеш.“ Често смо у тој позицији, "Господе, пошаљи руком кога хоћеш, било кога осим мене Господе." А ипак, Бог је наредио да нас користи.<br/>Сада свако од нас може показати своје несавршености. Свако од нас може указати на своје неспособности, и сви ми можемо наћи изговор зашто Бог не би желео да ме користи. Али ипак, Бог је изабрао да вас користи. Да би кроз свој живот Он могао да се открије сиромашном свету. Питате се када Бог има такве инструменте да користи како је икада урадио посао, зар не?<br/>До дана када је био узет, након што је кроз Духа Светога дао заповести апостолима које је изабрао (Дела 1:2):<br/>То је оно што је завршио Јеванђеље по Луки са. Дан када је Исус био узет, након што је рекао апостолима да чекају на давање моћи.<br/>Њима се показао и живим после муке своје многим непогрешивим доказима (Дела 1:3).<br/>Тешко је порећи чињеницу васкрсења Исуса Христа. Био сам забављен, као и узнемирен и иритирао, чланком који сам прочитао у Санта Ана Регистар прошле суботе. О науци о стварању и еволуционим теоријама које су представљене у окружним школама. Како то, овај један професор је рекао да предаје научну класу, и стога, они се баве само чињеницама, и да немају места за теорије. Зато што се наука заснива на чињеницама, а стварање се заснива на религијским сујеверјима. Потребно је пуно вере да би се веровало религијским теоријама. Када се бавите чињеницама, можете их једноставно прихватити. Помислио сам, "Веома интересантно у тој научној класи, научили су ме да је то чињеница да је свет стар четири милијарде година. Сада данас уче да је то чињеница да је свет стар дванаест милијарди година. И то није било тако давно да сам отишао у школу. "<br/>Занимљиво је да Библија никада није морала бити ревидирана или ажурирана како би се задовољили тренутни подаци које су људи открили. А ипак, ако бисте данас узели моје средњошколске научне уџбенике и покушали да од њих научите научну класу, открили бисте да многе ствари које су се училе као научне чињенице када сам био у средњој школи више нису препознате као научне чињенице. Једноставна ћелијска протоплазма више није једноставна ћелија, већ изузетно сложена. Ако постоји чињеница која се може потврдити у историји, то је чињеница васкрсења Исуса Христа из мртвих.<br/>Имамо систем судске праксе који се заснива на сведочењу сведока. Ако је човек оптужен за злочин и има људи који су били сведоци тог злочина док је био почињен, и они су доведени до стандарда, и они се заклињу да говоре истину, целу истину и ништа осим истине, тако им Бог помаже. И у свом испитивању они тврде да: "Видео сам тог човека у банци двадесет трећег маја. Видео сам га како извлачи пиштољ из капута. Чуо сам га како захтева да му се сав новац да. Видео сам га док је напуштао банку. Видео сам га као официр га је ухапсио напољу. "И ако можете да добијете три или четири сведока да укаже на тог човека и да ће држати своје сведочење под унакрсним испитивањем, тај човек је осуђен да буде крив. Он је тај који је то урадио. Имамо два или три сведока који сведоче исту причу о том човеку, и прихваћено је као чињеница да је он тај који је починио злочин и да је крив.<br/>Након Исусове смрти, када је устао, Он се јавио многим људима који су сведочили под заклетвом да су га видели. Да су разговарали са њим, да им се јавио на различитим местима под различитим околностима. И за период од четрдесет дана је у посети са њима. И у једном тренутку, до пет стотина људи који су се окупили на једном месту, Он се појавио. Тешко је само одбацити или порећи сведочанство ових људи. Да би се то урадило, дискредитује се цео наш систем судске праксе. Али не само то, ови људи који су сведочили да су видели васкрслог Господа, да су разговарали са Њим, да су јели са Њим, сви су, осим једног, суочени са насилном смрћу од стране других људи, јер су тврдили да је прича коју су испричали истинита. Говорите о сведоцима који су се заклели да ће говорити истину, целу истину, ништа осим истине. Ако је нечији живот био угрожен због тог сведока, а то је била лаж, бар један од њих би се сломио под притиском. Они би признали целу превару. "Показао се жив након своје страсти многим непогрешивим доказима."<br/>И видевши их четрдесет дана, говорећи им о царству Божијем (Дела 1:3).<br/>Понекад кривимо ученике због њихових питања о времену Божјег краљевства. Нека се запамти да је Божје краљевство било омиљени предмет Исуса Христа. Он је увек говорио о Царству Божијем, и то је велика нада да је Он засадио у срцима свих људи. Ствари неће увек остати корумпирана као што су. Свет неће заувек проћи под влашћу таме, под ропством зла. Бог ће једног дана успоставити Своје царство на земљи. Царство праведне радости и мира. "Исус ће владати, где сунце иде своје узастопне путовања. И Његово краљевство ће се протезати од обале до обале." И тај дан ће бити најславнији дан који је свет икада видео, као што ће болести и патње и бол бити укинуте у Његовом царству. Као грех и похлепа и те ствари које су учиниле свет тако неподношљивим место ће бити укинуте у Његовом царству. Безбожни комерцијализам, експлоатација човека, све ове ствари су укинуте у Његовом славном краљевству када Он влада. Није ни чудо што су ученици жељни да га добију. Једва чекам да га добијем; Једва чекам да дође Његово краљевство. И Исус нам је рекао када се молимо, прва молба је, "Дођи краљевство твоје. Нека буде воља твоја на земљи, као што је на небу" (Матеј 6:10 ). То је права врста жеље коју сви треба да имамо. Желим царство Божије. И тако им је говорио о царству током овог четрдесетодневног периода.<br/>И сабравши се с њима, заповеди им да не одлазе из Јерусалима, него да чекају обећање Оца, које сте чули од мене (Дела 1:4).<br/>А он рече: ево, сачекајте овде у Јерусалиму док не примите обећање Оца. Ово обећање на које се он односи је, без сумње, обећање у Јоилу где је Господ обећао, "И то ће се десити у наредним данима, вели Господ, да ћу излити дух свој на свако тело; и синови и кћери ваши ће пророковати, и младићи ваши ће сањати снове, и старци ваши ће видети визије; и на слуге своје и слуге своје Ја ћу излити Духа свога." Обећање Оца: доћи ће дан када ће Бог излити Свог Духа на свако тело, на све вернике. Они ће, сваки, примити ту динамику од Бога.<br/>Јер Јован је крштен водом, а ви ћете бити крштени Духом Светим за неколико дана (Дела 1:5).<br/>Идеја крштења била је идеја побјегавања, крштења. Јован је крстио водом, потопио људе у воду, "за неколико дана ћете бити потопљени у Духу Светом."<br/>А кад се окупише, питаху га говорећи: Господе, хоћеш ли у ово време вратити царство Израиљу?<br/>"Када ће то бити, Господе? Када је време за ову обнову?" И Исус им сада говори, не о краљевству, већ о моћи коју ће добити за службу. И тако Он одбацује њихово питање.<br/>Рекавши им: Није на вама да знате времена или времена која је Отац поставио у своју власт (Дела 1:7).<br/>"То није за вас да знате." Они су стално живели у очекивању непосредног успостављање краљевства. Током читавог Исусовог живота, они су очекивали да у сваком тренутку да уђе у телефонску кабину и изаћи као Спаситељ света. Схаззам! Показује своју моћ и свргавање влада света, успостављање Божјег краљевства на земљи. И они су свакодневно чекали ову промену да се деси. И сваки пут када би Исус говорио о одласку у Јерусалим, предао се у руке грешног човека, а затим био распет, "О, о не, Господе. Не, не разумеш царство, Господе. Буди тако далеко од Тебе." Када је Исус умро на крсту, сви су били веома разочарани.<br/>Два ученика на путу за Емаус, тако тужна. "Хеј, момци. Како то да сте тако тужни као што ходате?" "Како то мислите? Мора да сте странац овде ако не знате ствари које се дешавају у Јерусалиму у последње време." "Какве ствари?" "О, човек по имену Исус из Назарета...о човеку, био је моћан и моћан. Божије помазање је било на Његовом животу. Надали смо се да је у Њему било избављење Израела, али су га разапели. Надали смо се . . . сада је мртав. " Сада је васкрсао, и Он каже, "За неколико дана, људи, ви ћете добити обећање Оца." "Ох, какво обећање? Обећање успостављања краљевства?" Видите, било је легитимно да питају. "Да ли је то Господ? У реду! Да ли је време? Хоћете ли сада успоставити своје краљевство?" "Не. Није за вас да знате та времена да је Отац одређен или да Отац има у својој власти. Али, примићете силу када Дух Свети сиђе на вас. "<br/>Сада се овде грчки предлог епи користи да означи нови однос који су они требали имати са Светим Духом. У Јеванђељу по Јовану, поглавље 14, док је Исус обећавао да ће послати Духа Светога, Он је рекао: "Нећу вас оставити без утехе. Ја ћу доћи к вама, и помолићу се Оцу, и он ће вам послати другог утешитеља, Духа истине, кога свет не може примити, јер га не види и не познаје га, него га ви познајете, јер живи с вама, и он ће бити у вама“ (Јован 14:17-18). Исти грчки предлог као и наш, само га пишу "ен" уместо "у". Двоструки однос тамо у Јовану: Он је са вама, али Он ће живети у вама. Али сада Исус је рекао да ћеш примити моћ када Дух Свети сиђе на тебе. Грчки предлог епи, који се преводи у различитим текстовима широм Новог завета као "на" или "преко" или ми се свиђа, "прелива".<br/>У седмом поглављу Јеванђеља по Јовану: "У последњи дан, у велики дан празника, када је Исус стајао тамо на храмској гори и викао народу: "Ако је ко жедан нека дође к мени и пије; и ко пије воду коју дајем, из дубине његове ту ће тећи потоци воде живе." Јован је рекао, "Ово је говорио о Духу, који још није дат да они који верују у Њега треба да приме" (Јован 7:37-39 ). Шта је рекао о Духу? Да ће бити као поток живе воде која тече. Или: „Кад вас дух преплави“, или: „Кад вас дух преплави“, или: „Кад вас дух преплави“, или: „Кад вас дух преплави“. Дакле, троструки однос: Он је са вама пре вашег обраћења, Он је онај који вас наводи да схватите да сте грешник, Он је онај који указује на Исуса Христа као одговор док убеђује свет у грех, праведност и суд. У тренутку када отворите свој живот и срце Исусу Христу и позовете га да уђе, Свети Дух долази и почиње да вас насељава. Он ће бити у вама. "Зар не знате да нисте своји, скупо сте купљени, зато прославите Бога у свом телу и у свом духу, који су Његови. И не знате ли да је ваше тело храм Светог Духа који је у вама? Не опијајте се вином, у којем је вишак, него се испуните, или се испуните Духом" (1 Кор 6,19-20 , Еф 5:18 ). Али сада је трећи однос. Ово је оснажујуће искуство.<br/>Ви ћете примити динамику, када Дух Свети дође на вас, и када се то излије из вас, и ви ћете ми бити сведоци (Дела 1:8).<br/>И тако динамичан, да буде сведок за Исуса Христа. Занимљиво је да је реч сведок на грчком је реч мартус одакле добијамо нашу реч мученик. И на грчком то значи мученик. Сведок је онај који не само да објављује оно у шта верује, он живи оно у шта верује, он је оно у шта верује, и он у то толико чврсто верује, да ће, ако је потребно, умрети за оно у шта верује. То је колико је јака његова вера. Он је Мартус. Не можете га зауставити, не боји се да умре за оно у шта верује.<br/>Сећате се када се Павле враћао у Јерусалим, а Агав је сишао из Цезареје и узео Павлов појас, везао се и рекао: „Тако је онај који поседује овај појас да буде везан кад стигне у Јерусалим“. А Павлови пријатељи су почели да плачу, говорећи, "Ох, Павле, не иди, не иди." А он је рекао, "Шта мислиш под овим сузама? Да ли мислиш да ћеш ме одвратити? Да ли мислиш да сам забринут због везивања? Спреман сам да умрем." Он је био Мартус. "Ја сам спреман да умрем." Бити убијен за своју веру није те учинио мучеником; јер си био мученик, био си убијен. Јер си био сведок, јер си веровао тако јако. Дакле, то вас није учинило сведоком, то је само доказало шта сте. Све време сте били сведок. Да нисте били Мартус, никада не бисте отишли у смрт. Одрекли бисте се; рекли бисте: "Чекај, чекај, чекај. Чекај, хајде да променимо курс овде. Мислим да сам можда направио грешку." Онда кажете, "Па, он није био Мартус. Крађа коња не чини вас коња лоповом; то само доказује да сте били. Нико не краде коња осим ако је коњ лопов. Дакле, крађа вас не чини лоповом коња, то само доказује да сте били све време. Бити мученик само доказује шта сте били сведок, Мартус. "И ви ћете бити сведоци." И није ли занимљиво да је већина њих била мученик? "Сведоци за мене."<br/>Сведочење је требало да буде и у Јерусалиму и по целој Јудеји (Дела 1:8).<br/>Сведок је почео управо код куће. Најтеже место, зар не? То је да почне управо код куће у Јерусалиму, а затим подручје око Јерусалима, подручје Јудеје. А онда је требало да се шири у Самарији. А онда је требало да изађе у крајње делове света. И док проучавамо књигу Дела апостолска, видећемо овај исти напредак. Како је сведочанство почело у Јерусалиму. То ћемо добити у следећем поглављу. А онда ћемо видети како је почело да се шири по Јудеји. А онда Филип је отишао у Самарију, а онда су коначно Павле и Варнава позвани да иду у крајеве света. И тако се сведочанство ширило кроз помазање и снагу Духа Светога.<br/>Када је то рекао, док су гледали, он је био подигнут, и облак га је одвео од њихових очију (Дела 1:9).<br/>Ово је последње обећање које је Исус дао својим ученицима. То је то, последње речи пре Његовог вазнесења. Наравно, касније је дошао и разговарао са Павлом и другима, али пре Његовог вазнесења, ово је Његова последња реч. И на то, када је рекао ово, док су га гледали, он је био подигнут, и облак га је одвео од њихових очију.<br/>И док су гледали према небу док је ишао горе, гле, два човека стајаху поред њих у белим хаљинама (Дела 1:10).<br/>Претпостављамо да су то били анђели.<br/>А он рече: Људи Галилејци, зашто стојите и гледате на небо? овај Исус, који се од вас узноси на небо, тако ће доћи као што сте видели да иде на небо (Дела 1:11).<br/>Они су га видели како се уздиже на небо, и они ће га видети када се врати. "Гле, Господ долази са десет хиљадама својих светих, да изврши суд на земљи" (Јуд 1:14-15). А Он, Који нас љуби и даде Себе за нас, и Који нас учини Богу нашем царевима и свештеницима, који ће с Њим царовати на земљи, ево долази Господ, и свако око ће Га видети, и они који Га прободу оплакиваће се (Откривење 1:5-7). Дакле, Господ долази. Свако око ће га видети. Јеховини сведоци кажу да је већ дошао, али то је био тајни долазак. Пошто су га видели само ученици који су га видели како одлази, само су га ученици Јеховиних сведока видели како се враћа. Али Исус рече: "Ако вам кажу: 'Он је дошао у тајности и ушао у тајну одају, не верујте'" (Матеј 24:26 ). Дакле, морате изабрати да верујете Исусу или њима.<br/>"Овај Исус, који се узноси од вас на небо, тако ће доћи као што сте га видели да иде на небо."<br/>Сада постоји веома интересантан стих у ИИ Јохн, стих Дела 1:7 , "Јер многи преваранти су ушли у свет који не признају да је Исус Христ дошао у телу." То, нажалост, је лош превод грчког. Јер ово учешће је у садашњем времену и треба превести "долази у телу." Они који би порећи да Исус Христос долази у телу. Шта Јован каже о њима? "Они су преварант и антихрист. Пазите да не изгубимо оно што смо радили, него да примимо пуну награду. Јер ко год преступи и не остаје у учењу Христовом, нема Бога. Ко остаје у учењу Христовом, има и Оца и Сина. И ако неко дође на ваша врата (у суботу ујутру) и не донесе ово учење, не примајте га у свој дом, нити га поздрављајте. Јер онај ко га поздрави је учесник његових злих дела" (2Јн 1:7-11). Питајте их једно питање: "Да ли Исус долази у телу?" Само их питајте то питање. А ако кажу не, само се сетите шта вас је Јован упозорио и шта вам је Јован рекао. "Ако неко не признаје да Исус Христос долази у телу." Сећате ли се када је био са ученицима и Он је рекао, "Дај ми нешто да једем?" Он је рекао, "Знаш, духови не једу; додирните ме. Видите? То сам ја." Дакле, тај исти Исус долази поново на исти начин на који су га видели да иде на небо. И ја, за један, верујем да је долазак је врло брзо.<br/>Тада се вратише у Јерусалим са горе која се зове Маслина, која је од Јерусалима у суботу на путу (око две трећине миље). И кад уђоше, уђоше у горњу собу, где бораве и Петар, и Јаков, и Јован, и Андреј, и Филип, и Тома, и Вартоломеј, и Матеј, и Јаков Алфејев, и Симон Зилот, и Јуда, брат Јаковљев. И сви они једнодушно су се молили и молили, са женама и Маријом, мајком Исусовом, и са његовом браћом (Дела 1:12-14).<br/>Ово је последње помињање Марије, мајке Исусове. У овом тренутку и од тог тренутка, нема даљег помињања ње у Делима Апостолским или у посланицама. Нема помињања њене смрти или њеног чудесног вазнесења на небо, без смрти. Ништа се не спомиње у Писму.<br/>Његова браћа би се вероватно односила на Јакова и Јуду и на осталу браћу која су била синови Јосифа и Марије.<br/>Горња соба - постоје неки који кажу да је то иста горња соба у којој је Исус имао Последњу вечеру са својим ученицима. А ипак, постоје и други који држе ову горњу собу као собу у храму станицама где се састала рана црква. Изабери.<br/>И у оне дане уставши Петар усред ученика рече (број имена њихових беше око стотину и двадесет), браћо, мора да се испуни ово Писмо, које Дух Свети говори устама Давидовим о Јуди, који беше водич онима који узеше Исуса (Дела 1:15-16).<br/>Ево опет, Петар је још увек његов исти напорни себе. Они чекају у молитви и преклињање, а Петар устаје и каже, "Филловс, постоји стих који мора да се испуни." И знате да ће наставити, "Хајде да покренемо програм; хајде да бацимо жреб и сазнамо ко ће заузети Јудино место." Осећам да је Петар поново био у телу, испољавајући ту напорну природу која је била његова. И мислим да је будућа историја цркве у књизи Дела на то указује. Мене интересује Петрово разумевање Писма, како он цитира са толико места у Старом завету. Петар испољава веома велико разумевање Светог писма Старог завета, што је тачка у његову корист.<br/>Обратите пажњу да Петар приписује Светом Духу оно што је Давид написао. Тако, "Све Писмо је дато надахнућем Божијим" (2 Ти 3:16). Није део Писма. Јер, ако ми кажете да је део Писма дат надахнућем од Бога, онда морам да вас питам: "Који делови су надахнућем и који делови нису надахнућем?" А онда си ти ауторитет који ми говори у који део могу да верујем, а у који не могу да верујем, и у тренутку када Бог више није ауторитет, али ти си ауторитет, ја сам у невољи. Чувајте се оних који говоре: „Па, ви не можете да верујете у сва Писма.“ И сама Писма кажу: „Сва Писма су од Бога надахнута.“ И овде, Лука у писању онога што је Петар говорио, изјављује да је Давид заиста био говорник Светог Духа. Свети Дух, кроз уста Давидова, говорио о Јуди.<br/>Јер он је био избројан са нама, [био је један од дванаесторице] је добио део ове службе. Али сада овај човек купио поље за плату за безакоње; и пада наглавачке (Дела 1:17-18),<br/>Купио је поље, грнчарево поље, како каже Захарија у једанаестом поглављу.<br/>И паде наглавачке, и расцепи се у средини, и избухну сва утроба његова (Дела 1:18).<br/>Постоје они који проналазе несугласице у Писму, јер у једном од Јеванђеља нам је речено да када се Јуда вратио и покушао да врати новац, они су рекли: "Хеј, то је ваш проблем. Не можемо га узети." И ставио га назад у храмску ризницу. "То је крвави новац." Затим га је бацио тамо на под храма и изашао и обесио се. Овде нам Петар каже да је пао наглавачке и само се појавио. А постоје и они који замишљају неслагање. Врло једноставно, он је отишао на дрво да се обеси, везали конопац око врата и везали га за удове и скочио. И сила пада или сломио конопац или главу, и он је пао на доле у кањон и баш као што је рекао овде.<br/>То је било познато свим становницима Јерусалима, тако да се поље на њиховом језику зове Ацелдама, што значи: Поље крви. Јер је написано у књизи Псалма: „Нека опусте станови његови, и нека нико не станује у њима; и епископство његово нека други узме“ (Дела 1:19-20).<br/>Сада у стварности он цитира из два различита псалама овде. Из Псалама 69:25 , он га ставља заједно са Псалама 109:8 . И стављајући их заједно налази ове пророчанства о Јуди.<br/>Због тога ови људи (Дела 1:21)<br/>Ево где траже некога да заузме Јудино место да буде апостол. Ево квалификација које су тражили у то време.<br/>Зато од ових људи који су били са нама све време да је Господ Исус у и из међу нама (Дела 1:21),<br/>Сада се сећате да је било много ученика, од којих су многи ученици Исус изабрао десет да буду апостоли. А реч апостол значи "један који је послат." Или изабрао дванаест да буду апостоли, па је послао дванаест. Број људске владе. "Имамо само једанаест. Треба нам један да заузме место Јуде, али нам је потребан један који је био са нама све време од почетка са Исусом."<br/>Од времена када је крштен од Јована, до дана када је узет од нас, један мора бити одређен да буде сведок Његовог васкрсења (Дела 1:22).<br/>Дакле, то су били захтеви које су тражили. Неко ко је био око целог времена. Од времена Јовановог крштења до вазнесења. И онај који је видео васкрслог Господа, и на тај начин могао да поднесе чињеницу васкрсења, њихово сведочанство о томе.<br/>Апостол Павле, касније тврдећи да је апостол, рекао је: "Зар нисам видео васкрслог Христа?" Очигледно је да је то био један од услова апостолства. Неко ме је питао: "Да ли постоје апостоли данас?" Па, не знам. Мислим да не постоје у истом смислу као што су били у Новом завету. Сигурно не постоји нико данас који може да сведочи о васкрсењу као што су урадили.<br/>И поставише двојицу, Јосифа званог Варсава, који се звао Јуст, и Матија. И помолише се, и рекоше: Ти, Господе, који знаш срца свих људи, покажи да ли си од ове двојице које си изабрао (Дела 1:23-24),<br/>Мислим да често правимо ову грешку дајући Господу два избора, оба погрешна. Ограничавање Бога, видите. Ми смо тако склони да то урадимо. Очигледно, Павле је био Божији избор. Питер је био нестрпљив, и скочио је пиштољом и рекао: "Хеј, морамо да урадимо нешто, знаш, морамо да помогнемо Богу. Знаш, један је нестао и морамо да га попунимо." А ипак, "Боже, који од ове двојице желиш?" И дао Богу два избора.<br/>Да би могао да прими део ове службе и овог апостолства, из којег је Јуда пао преступом, да би могао да оде на своје место. И тако су дали своје жребове (Дела 1:25-26 );<br/>Занимљив начин на који су настојали да одреде вољу Божију. Хајде да бацимо коцкице, сазнајте шта је Божја воља је овде. То је интересантно за мене, различите начине на које су људи осмислили да разазнају вољу Божију. Сада, у старозаветним временима, имали су занимљив начин да дођу до свештеника, који би питао Господа за њих преко Урим и Тумим, "светла и савршенства." Управо оно што су ови Урим и Тумим били, не знамо. Сигуран сам да то нису обојене наочаре које је Џозеф Смит пронашао са Златним плочама; чаробне наочаре, да када их ставите, можете изненада прочитати хијероглифски натпис.<br/>Постоје они који кажу да су Урим и Тумим заправо црно-бели камен који се носио у торбици на грудима свештеника. Они би се молили и постављали Господу одређено питање. Сећаш се да је Давид постављао Господу одређена питања: „Господе, хоћемо ли изаћи на Филистеје?“ Одговор је био: „Не.“ А сутрадан: „Господе, хоћемо ли изаћи на Филистеје?“ Одговор је био: „Да.“ „Када ћемо изаћи?“ Постављали би специфична питања, а Господ би их водио кроз Урим и Тумин. Кажу да ће се свештеник молити, тражити Бога, а затим посегнути и извући један од два камена. Ако је то био бели камен, то је био одговор да. Ако би то било не, онда би то био црни камен који би извукао. Неки чак кажу да смо добили термин црна кугла од овог Урим и Тхуммим. Заправо, назад у оригиналу то је не гласа против одређеног пројекта или идеје. Шта су били Урим и Тумим, не знамо. Али током старозаветног периода, они су користили метод бацања жреба да би одредили Божју вољу.<br/>Дакле, овдје ученици узимају исту ствар као што бацају коцкице да виде који је од двојице које је Бог изабрао да замијени Јуду Искариотског.<br/>Жреб је пао на Матија; он је био избројан са једанаест (Дела 1:26).<br/>Сада ко у свету је Матија? Нико никада није чуо за њега пре или после. Биће занимљиво упознати Матија и сазнати ко је он и шта је урадио. Мислим из наредне историје, очигледно је претпоставити да је Бог изабрао Павла као апостола. Павле изјављује сам. Сада је ово последњи пут да смо икада прочитали о њима покушавају да разазнају вољу Божију бацањем жреба или случајно неку врсту ствари.<br/>Знам једног човека данас, у настојању да разазна вољу Господњу, да ће се молити и питати Господа једно питање. Он ће имати десет пенија у џепу, и док се моли, он ће узети пеније са затвореним очима и ставити их на сто, а ако сви дођу главе, то је да. Занимљива ствар, с времена на време, сви ће доћи до главе, и то је прилично добра шанса. Ипак, не налазимо никакав образац за то након што је дат Свети Дух. Када је Свети Дух дошао на цркву, онда је Свети Дух почео да им говори и усмерава их. И Свети Дух је рекао: "Одвојите ми Павла и Варнаву за службу где сам их позвао" ( Дела 13:2 ). И Свети Дух их је послао. Дакле, налазимо цркву више директно вођени Светим Духом. Када је Свети Дух дошао, ово бацање коцке да сазнате вољу Божију је одложено.<br/>"<br/><br/>Краљ Џејмс Верзија<br/><br/>Ово је верзија Библије краља Џејмса из 1769. године (позната и као Овлашћена верзија). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2. Most noise cancelling headphones use the built in mic for the DSP (the noise cancelling) and to make calls so the signal from the mic needs to be able to be sent to the phone too.<br/>3.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Међутим, потенцијално је ограничена у томе користи јер је већина примарних података написана са очигледним политичким ставовима и скривеним агендама.<br/>Стаљин је изазвао политичко уништење бољшевичке партије.

Стаљинова опозиција унутар партије, укључујући Бухарина, Јагоду и Рикова, била је очишћена на овим суђењима, јер их је Стаљин манипулативно присилио да признају злочине планирања државног удара и супротстављања држави, чак и ако није било доказа. Габор Т. Ритерспорн је рекао: "Многе жртве су искрено посвећене начелима бољшевизма." Ово појачава доказ да су бољшевички идеали који су некада били корени Комунистичке партије били неуређени и уништени чисткама. Партија је исцрпљена, а бивши чланови су беспомоћно гледали како Стаљин користи велику чистку као средство за трансформацију Русије из једнопартијске државе у неоспорну диктатуру. Опет, чистке су разбијале оквир Комунистичке партије, формиране током бољшевичке револуције. Ово се слаже са извором "Стаљин џелат" јер обојица показују манипулативни карактер, који је помогао диктатору да ојача свој захват за грло Русије.<br/>Манипулативни начин, којим је Стаљин инкриминисао своју циљану опозицију током чистки, у очима свакодневних Руса, такође је имао имплозивни утицај на совјетско друштво. Стаљин је био у стању да прикупи подршку од народа кроз употребу пропаганде и медија како би му помогао да развије "култ личности" и слику херојског и храброг вође. Кроз ову подршку Стаљин је усадио неповерење у умове људи, убеђујући их да су издајници револуције и оно што је он описао као "непријатељи народа" били међу њима.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Суперцелл је нервирајући свађачи уместо нервирајућих звезданих овлашћења. Био сам на КСНУМКС прошле сезоне са снагом КСНУМКС нита и веома је тешко проћи поред тога, као, звездане моћи играју заиста доминантну улогу. Матцхмакинг је такође смеће. Када играм драгуљ граб (око 600 трофеја), често постоје утакмице у којима непријатељски тим има једног играча више од нас који је максимиран и није чак ни да имамо лвл 9 да се такмичимо против тога. Понекад постоје чак и утакмице где је непријатељски тим је у потпуности максималан и нико од нас су. то је разлог зашто ја не играју свађа звезде озбиљно више. То није ни као да нема много играча који нису максималан и око 600 трофеја. То је досадно.<br/>Едит: Мислим да суперцелл треба да има барем основни механизам који узима просек нивоа свађа приликом постављања утакмица.<br/><br/>Осим што трофеји заправо не указују на вашу вештину. Они указују на вештину саиграча са којима сте постављени. И ја сам у реду са играњем против свађача вишег нивоа, али када је један тим на нивоу КСНУМКС, а други тим није, јасно је да је неуравнотежен.<br/><br/>Препоручујем да добијем неке добре пријатеље са којима се играм, ја и 2 пријатеља добили су моје пријатеље снагу 1 крпељ да рангирају 28 играњем драгуља са одређеном композицијом цео дан и то смо урадили без да се један од нас максимира са нашим свађачима.<br/><br/>Знам како се осећате да сам некада имао борце у високим трофејима са ниским нивоом и тешко је ићи даље и све што сам говорио себи "Желим да имам звездане моћи" стварно суперцелл треба да направи равнотежу са звезданим моћима или барем направити бољи систем подударања.<br/><br/>Некако осећам ово. Нисам тако добар у игри као ти, али сам добио Емз на КСНУМКС на снази КСНУМКС и подударање је било ужасно. Макеед играчи свуда! И није помогло што је већина мојих саиграча имала око КСНУМКС-КСНУМКСк трофеја ... Морао сам да прибегнем соло обрачуну у последњем тренутку јер могу или да заседнем играче без сумње или једноставно играм мало агресивно у право време. Али стварно бих волео да би то могло бити мало лакше за људе који желе да гурају борце на заиста високе трофејне опсеге без луксуза звезданих моћи.<br/><br/>Алтхо шиљак је још увијек добар без цурвебалла. Цурвебалл је био само помоћ за ударање ваших удараца чешће као шиљак. Али чак и прије него што је цурвебалл пуштен, шиљак је био стварно јак свађач, тако да ће сада остати исти.<br/><br/>Слажем се да су требали нервирати засједу, али мислим да покушавају да уравнотеже и Снаппи Снипинг и Амбусх, јер се обојица спајају са овом промјеном. Постајала је мало моћна, али још увијек није нервозна<br/><br/>Нисам сигуран у ово, али сада када је Даррил добио приметан буф, гледајући њихове нове статистике, изгледа да би Даррил могао да засенчи Булл, јер не само да увек може да се носи са више штете од Булл-а, он више неће умрети тако да ће њихова преживљавање бити слична без звездане снаге (иако је Буллов преживљавање и даље приметно боље од Даррил-а). Не само то, Дерилов супер може да се аутоматски регенерише, што значи да би Дерил могао да се ефикасно игра и као тешка категорија и убица у исто време (пре него што је усисавао као тешка категорија, али пристојан као убица)<br/><br/>Али он је прецењен аф. И добијате трофеје са њим заиста лако. Тако да сам некако у реду са нервом. Нисам га чак ни играо од када сам га добио на 500 (пре око 5 месеци), тако да ми није стало ни толико.<br/><br/>Зашто Поцо / Пенни не добије ХП нерв, ако су Марксман / Хеалер респективно не тенк?<br/>Зашто Росина танкост није нервирана, кашаљ 70% смањење штете?<br/>Зашто је Тицк дозвољено да има највећи опсег и најслободнији покедамаге у целој игри?<br/>Зашто Леон не добије ХП / Дамаге буфф?<br/><br/>Било како било, то је била заседа која је била ОП, а не база Пајпер. Ја бих тврдио да је заседа најбоља звезда у игри (сада још више јер је проценат повећања штете индиректно отишао горе) и база Пајпер је била доња КСНУМКС свађалица.<br/><br/>Оно што Суперцелл треба да уради је да врати оба нерва, смањи Амбусх на 600 и смањи Снаппи Снипинг на 0,25 јер би га индиректно буффирао основни буфф оштећења.<br/><br/>Да и ја верујем да су отишли мало предалеко са Росом, јер је сада у основи бољи бик сада када је у питању танкирање, што је већ неко време. Сада, Даррил би могао бити мањи, моћнији бик<br/><br/>Зашто? Осећам да јој је потребан буф у скоро свему осим њене звездане моћи. Њено здравље и брзина чине је супер мало тежом за употребу, јер може прилично лако умрети, а стварно јој је тешко да зароби брже свађаче попут Цров-а. Њена звезда моћ је помало сломљена... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment.

Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Самозапошљавање део 1<br/><br/>Када прихватите посао у било којој организацији, морате обављати различите послове према захтевима вашег послодавца и можете добити фиксни износ прихода као плату.
