| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>L'històric barri de Leclaire, abans conegut com el "barri del sud" d'Edwardsville, va ser fundat com una comunitat cooperativa el 1890 i va romandre com un poble separat fins que es va annexionar a la ciutat d'Edwardsville el 1934. Periòdics i revistes d'arreu dels Estats Units i Europa van informar sobre l'experiment Leclaire, particularment durant els primers 20 anys de la seva existència. El 1979, a causa de la seva història única, l'antiga vila va ser inscrita en el Registre Nacional de Llocs Històrics.<br/><br/>Leclaire va ser fundada per Nelson Oliver Nelson, un fabricant de fontaneria de St. Louis que, durant molts anys, va tractar d'avançar la difícil situació de la classe obrera. Nelson volia millorar les condicions de treball dels seus empleats i proporcionar habitatge a prop de les fàbriques perquè els treballadors i les seves famílies poguessin participar fàcilment en programes recreatius i educatius oferts de forma gratuïta per l'empresa. Abans de 1890, mentre encara estava a St. Louis, els negocis de fabricació i distribució de la N. O. Nelson Company van començar a proporcionar beneficis compartits juntament amb oportunitats educatives i recreatives. L'experiment cooperatiu de Leclaire aportaria beneficis addicionals.<br/><br/>Quan els empleats de Nelson van indicar que volien traslladar-se a una ubicació rural, els representants de la companyia es van acostar als líders de petites ciutats en diverses comunitats de Missouri i Illinois a prop de la seva seu de St. Louis. Estaven buscant una propietat adequada per construir noves fàbriques i un poble model. Al sud d'Edwardsville van trobar un terreny de 125 acres amb accés a aigua, carbó i transport. Els empresaris locals van actuar ràpidament per oferir un incentiu financer. En menys de tres setmanes, la comunitat va recaptar un fons de 20.000 dòlars a partir de contribucions individuals d'entre 1 i 1.000 dòlars per atraure Nelson a triar Edwardsville per a la seva empresa.<br/><br/>Els líders de la ciutat tenien l'esperança de localitzar propietats dins dels límits de la ciutat d'Edwardsville, però quan no es va poder trobar cap lloc adequat, estaven segurs que la inversió de Nelson al sud de la ciutat aviat es convertiria en una part d'Edwardsville. Tot i que Nelson va complir totes les contingències per a la construcció i la creació d'ocupació en el seu contracte, seria 44 anys abans de l'annexió a Edwardsville. Leclaire, limitat per Madison / Brown Avenues a l'est, les vies del ferrocarril a l'oest, Hadley / McKinley Avenues al sud i Wolf Street al nord, va romandre un poble independent de 1890 a 1934. Durant aquest temps es va guanyar una reputació per les innovacions en els negocis, l'educació i la planificació residencial.<br/><br/>El poble de Leclaire en un mapa de 1931 d'Edwardsville<br/>Guió: Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>La decisió de Nelson de construir un poble no es va fer per caprici. A finals de la dècada de 1880 va ser un líder internacional en els camps de la cooperació i la participació en els beneficis, intercanviant teories socials amb altres persones de tot el món mentre expandia el seu negoci a St. Louis. Va anomenar el seu poble experimental en honor del parisí Edme Jean Leclaire, però va visitar molts altres visionaris socials que van proporcionar informació i inspiració. Compilant les millors idees d'aquests exemples, Nelson va fundar Leclaire per, en les seves paraules, "donar feina, promoure la intel·ligència, proporcionar recreació, fomentar la bellesa i fer llars". Aquests van ser tots els factors que va determinar necessaris perquè els homes portin vides satisfactòries. Els escriptors posteriors van utilitzar aquestes paraules per formular els principis fundacionals de Leclaire: Treball, Llars, Educació, Recreació i Bellesa, però amb l'important principi addicional de Llibertat.<br/><br/>Treballs<br/><br/>El treball podria considerar-se el més important d'aquests factors, ja que sense els treballs de fàbrica a Leclaire, no hi hauria poble. Els edificis de la fàbrica de maó van ser dissenyats per l'arquitecte E. A. Cameron per proporcionar llum natural, ventilació a l'estiu i terres climatitzats a l'hivern. Hi havia un sistema d'extinció d'incendis i, encara que els accidents industrials no es van eliminar, es va fer tot el possible per garantir la seguretat dels treballadors. Els edificis de maó coberts d'herba estaven envoltats de gespa ben cuidada i jardins de flors que donaven al complex una aparença semblant al campus. El 1894, la periodista de New York World Nellie Bly va anomenar els edificis "la perfecció ideal dels edificis perquè l'home hi treballés".<br/><br/>El complex de fabricació de la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company a Leclaire<br/>Amics de Leclaire<br/><br/>Les polítiques de l'empresa Nelson es van dissenyar per protegir l'estabilitat financera dels empleats. Els treballadors podrien guanyar una part dels beneficis i tenir una veu a l'empresa si triaven aquesta opció. El pla de repartiment de beneficis va donar als empleats de Nelson un orgull de propietat que va resultar en una força de treball de suport. Hi va haver algunes vagues laborals de curta durada al llarg dels anys, però en la seva major part, els problemes laborals eren rars. Els treballadors també tenien hores raonables i salaris competitius. Hi havia un fons de previsió que proporcionava pensions i baixa per malaltia, així com pensions de vídua si un treballador moria, sigui o no la mort estava relacionada amb el seu treball.<br/><br/>La seu de l'empresa per a la N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) va romandre a St. Louis, però tota la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company es va traslladar a Leclaire. La companyia de fabricació es va dividir en botigues que fabricaven una varietat de productes. El 1900, les botigues es van convertir en empreses independents amb finalitats fiscals, però totes encara eren propietat de la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Les botigues incloïen el Molí de Gabinet on es produïen productes de fusta des de l'armari fins al molí. Els artesans qualificats que treballaven aquí també complien contractes especials, incloent gàbies per a un banc local i un altar encara en ús a l'Església Episcopal de Sant Andreu a Edwardsville. The Marble Shop es va especialitzar en el marbre arquitectònic que va ser tallat i instal·lat per les tripulacions de Nelson en cases, negocis i fins i tot en els capitolis estatals de tot el Midwest. La botiga de màquines, que es va convertir en Bignall i Keeler, va fer màquines d'instal·lació de canonades, bombes, calibres i diverses eines mecàniques esperades en el comerç de fontaneria. També es van ramificar per fabricar articles especialitzats com la Leclaire Bicycle a mitjans de la dècada de 1890. La Botiga de Llautó incloïa una foneria on es fabricaven diverses canonades i eines de fontaneria. Aquests exemples representen només alguns dels treballs realitzats a les fàbriques de Leclaire. El logotip de la companyia era un estilitzat "NONCO" que encara es pot veure en els aparells de fontaneria i alguns hidrants d'incendis a Edwardsville avui en dia.<br/><br/>Llars<br/><br/>Abans que es poguessin construir les cases, es necessitava habitatge per als treballadors que estaven completant els edificis de la fàbrica, així com la construcció de cases. Per satisfer aquestes necessitats, l'empresa va construir la "Casa del Club", un gran edifici que servia molts propòsits. A més de l'allotjament, va ser el primer edifici educatiu de la comunitat, i contenia una biblioteca ben proveïda.<br/><br/>La construcció de la part residencial de Leclaire va començar immediatament després que el poble fos fundat el juny de 1890. Julius Pitzman, l'arquitecte paisatgista innovador que va exposar els primers lots a Leclaire, els va establir amb una sèrie de pactes de protecció. Els pactes preveien carrers amples i curvilíneos, grans lots i una restricció d'actes que limitava les propietats només a propòsits residencials o educatius. La companyia va pavimentar els carrers, va proporcionar llums elèctrics, va instal·lar voreres i va plantar centenars d'arbres al llarg dels carrers de Leclaire. Seccions posteriors de Leclaire es van establir amb un disseny de reixeta convencional i lots més petits, però encara incloïen les restriccions de l'acte.<br/><br/>Una cabana victoriana de Leclaire el 1907<br/>Direcció: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inicialment, les cases van ser construïdes per l'empresa i després venudes a un cost proper als empleats de Nelson per fomentar la propietat de l'habitatge. Si un treballador es va posar malalt i no va poder fer la seva hipoteca, els pagaments es van suspendre fins després que tornés a treballar. Les cases es van oferir en una varietat de dissenys de cases i l'empresa va anunciar que no hi havia dos habitatges iguals. Les primeres cases eren principalment cases victorianes que venien amb electricitat i aigua corrent. Aquests van ser seguits per bungalous, foursquares, i fins i tot algunes cases de kit. Els residents podien comprar una casa construïda per l'empresa o comprar un terreny buit i construir una casa ells mateixos, sempre que el disseny arquitectònic compleixi amb els estàndards de l'empresa.<br/><br/>En els últims anys, els lots van ser venuts a inversors, normalment residents d'Edwardsville, i moltes cases en la dècada de 1920 van ser construïdes per contractistes locals que després els van vendre als residents de la zona.<br/><br/>Educació<br/><br/>Nelson creia en l'educació per a tothom, inclosa la classe treballadora. La programació educativa va començar amb un jardí d'infants al Club House el 1892 i va continuar en el nou edifici educatiu al 722 Holyoake Road. Comunament anomenada la "Casa de l'Escola", aquest edifici proporcionava una gran sala per a reunions i programes, però tenia particions mòbils per dividir-la en espais d'aula durant el dia. Al vespre, hi havia balls, reunions o programes del Leclaire Self-Culture Club que presentaven conferències setmanals de professors de la Universitat de Washington o oradors coneguts a nivell nacional que, com N. O. Nelson, formaven part del moviment de millora social a principis de segle. Aquests inclouen Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, i l'escriptora Charlotte Perkins Gilman, entre d'altres.<br/><br/>Nens matriculats a l'escola bressol Leclaire el 1913<br/>Direcció: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>En els deu anys següents a la construcció de l'edifici d'educació de 1895, hi va haver una sèrie d'experiments educatius que inclouen una escola industrial, una universitat, una escola nocturna i una acadèmia. L'esforç més antic i més longeu va ser el jardí d'infants del matí, fundat el 1892, que utilitzava el model Fröbel. Aquest programa de dos anys va ser gratuït per a tothom, inclosos els nens d'Edwardsville, fins al 1931, quan per raons financeres la companyia va començar a cobrar la matrícula als estudiants que no eren fills d'empleats. Nelson Manufacturing va operar un jardí d'infants fins a 1934, quan l'edifici va ser lliurat al districte escolar d'Edwardsville per una tarifa nominal.<br/><br/>Recreació<br/><br/>Barquers al llac Leclaire el 1915<br/>Direcció: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>L'esbarjo era una característica important de Leclaire. L'empresa proporcionava instal·lacions esportives per al beisbol, el tennis i, més tard, el futbol. Es va construir una sala de bowling i billar i hi havia un llac per a la navegació, la natació, la pesca o el patinatge sobre gel a l'hivern. Leclaire Park estava moblat amb casetes de vaixells, cases de bany masculines i femenines, i un gran pavelló. Els residents van organitzar balls, passejades per fencs, ortografia d'abelles i altres activitats, i la companyia va patrocinar una banda que tocava regularment en entreteniments al poble o a Edwardsville. Igual que les funcions educatives de la Casa Club i la Casa Escolar, les instal·lacions recreatives de Leclaire estaven obertes a tothom i sovint eren una destinació per als visitants d'Edwardsville i fins i tot de St. Louis.<br/><br/>Bellesa<br/><br/>Fotografia del llac Leclaire<br/>Direcció: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>L’últim dels factors que Nelson considerava importants per a una vida satisfactòria era el medi ambient. Nelson sabia de la importància d’una vida sana. Va valorar la bellesa i la neteja que es podia trobar al país, i va animar a tots els habitants de Leclaire a embellir la seva propietat plantant jardins i horts. El mateix Nelson va liderar amb l'exemple, de manera que un hivernacle de l'empresa va proporcionar flors gratuïtes i es van celebrar concursos per als patis més bells. Leclaire es va disposar de manera que tot el poble tenia un entorn com un parc encara evident avui.<br/><br/>Llibertat<br/><br/>La botiga cooperativa Leclaire<br/>Direcció: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson va enumerar cinc principis fundacionals per a Leclaire, però els escriptors moderns n'afegeixen un sisè: Llibertat. Tots els programes oferts per l'empresa estaven disponibles per als empleats, així com per als residents locals, però cap no era obligatori. La llibertat de triar si participar o no en els programes de l'empresa depèn totalment de l'individu. Els residents de Leclaire podien treballar per a Nelson Manufacturing o en un altre lloc, i els treballadors no tenien cap obligació de viure a Leclaire. La participació en programes recreatius i educatius també era opcional. També hi havia una botiga de l'empresa on els empleats podien comprar, però a diferència d'altres ciutats de l'empresa, ningú estava en deute amb la botiga de l'empresa. La botiga Leclaire era una cooperativa on els membres cobraven preus de mercat justos, però després es pagaven dividends trimestrals.<br/><br/>Una ciutat diferent<br/><br/>Tots aquests beneficis van fer que Leclaire fos única en altres ciutats de l'empresa. Però també hi va haver casos individuals en què l'empresa va mostrar compassió i cura pels empleats. La companyia va tancar les fàbriques i va contractar trens d'excursió per portar els treballadors i les seves famílies a St. Louis per un dia a l'Exposició Universal de 1904. Quan els diners eren escassos, Nelson ocasionalment col·locava diners extra en cada sobre de pagament per fer la vida més fàcil per als treballadors, i si instituïa un programa amb el qual els homes no estaven d'acord, ho parlaven i, amb freqüència, Nelson es revertiria a si mateix.<br/><br/>Nascut a Lillesand, Noruega, el 1841, N. O. Nelson era un home complicat. Era un capitalista que creia en la lliure empresa, però també un socialista, un seguidor de la "Regla d'Or", i un patriota que va servir per a la Unió en la Guerra Civil. El 1900 era multimilionari, però en el moment de la seva mort, el 1922, ho havia donat tot per a la millora de la classe obrera.<br/><br/>Encara que Leclaire no va ser l'únic experiment social de Nelson, es considera el seu esforç més reeixit. Altres grans esforços per a la millora social incloïen una cadena de supermercats cooperatius a Nova Orleans, un jardí d'infants per als fills d'empleats negres a la seva fàbrica de Bessemer, Alabama, i una llar per a consumidors a Indio, Califòrnia.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village de Leclaire va ser reconegut internacionalment com un experiment notable i reeixit. Va ser descrita al New York World en nombroses ocasions, però en particular per la periodista Nellie Bly el 1894, que va escriure llargament sobre la ciutat model on "La qüestió laboral es resol i tothom feliç en un petit poble prop de St. Louis". El Los Angeles Times també va informar regularment sobre N. O. Nelson, així com el Chicago Daily Tribune i nombroses altres publicacions.<br/><br/>En un discurs en la celebració del 15è aniversari de Leclaire el 1915, Nelson va dir: "Leclaire t'ofereix una àmplia hospitalitat oberta, i t'ofereix gaudir avui de la comoditat, la comoditat, la bellesa i la inspiració que gaudim cada dia". Més d'un segle ha passat des d'aquell dia, però la invitació encara es manté. Els residents i els investigadors estan convidats a conèixer la història de Leclaire i considerar les lliçons que es podrien aprendre per a la millora de les generacions futures.<br/><br/>Un dels antics edificis del complex de fabricació en 2019, que ara serveix com el N.

Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Visites d'autor a través de Zoom o Skype<br/><br/>Estic emocionat de visitar amb els seus estudiants a través de Zoom o Skype! Skype és una gran opció per a les escoles / classes que no estan portant autors en persona, però que volen explorar llibres i poesia, connectar amb un autor, i fer preguntes individuals.<br/><br/>Preu<br/><br/>Ofereix visites Zoom o Skype de 30-45 minuts amb les escoles per $ 125 per sessió (o $ 200 per a dues sessions que es fan en tres hores al matí o a la tarda; $ 325 per a tres sessions en un dia; $ 425 per a quatre sessions en un dia). En cada sessió, intento involucrar els nens el més activament possible. No, no és el mateix tipus de connexió que una visita en persona ofereix, però encara pot ser inspirador i motivador per als nens!<br/><br/>Què faig<br/><br/>Cada sessió per a un màxim de 50 alumnes inclou:<br/><br/>5 minuts d'instal·lació tecnològica<br/><br/>3 segments de 10ish-minutes cadascun — Vostè tria entre:<br/><br/>Com em vaig convertir en escriptor<br/><br/>Escriure aquest llibre en particular (tu tries en quin llibre m'enfoco)<br/><br/>Llegir (jo llegeixo alguns poemes i els nens m'ajuden a llegir-ne d'altres)<br/><br/>Presentació a l’aula (els teus alumnes han fet una lectura o una actuació per a mi, un públic molt agraït!)<br/><br/>Escriure un poema junts<br/><br/>Sessió de preguntes i respostes<br/><br/>5 minuts d'acomiadaments / acomiadaments<br/><br/>També parlo amb classes de professors de pre-servei o grups de professors en servei sobre poesia i escriptura.<br/><br/>Consells per a una gran visita virtual<br/><br/>Consells per a una visita virtual amb èxit<br/><br/>Un dels meus objectius per a les visites virtuals a l'escola és capturar la interactivitat que fa que les visites en persona siguin reeixides i divertides. Però la veritat és que de vegades és difícil ser virtualment interactiu! El temps pot no sincronitzar-se correctament, el que fa que llegir junts sigui un repte, i és molt difícil per a mi escoltar estudiants individuals a menys que vinguin i parlin directament al micròfon / ordinador. Però després d'alguna prova i error, he descobert algunes maneres de tenir les millors visites virtuals possibles. Aquí estan: 10 maneres de fer que la meva visita amb els seus estudiants una gran experiència!<br/><br/>Abans de la visita<br/><br/>Fes que els nens estiguin tan emocionats com sigui possible amb la visita. Visita la meva pàgina web amb ells. Llegeix alguns dels meus llibres amb ells. Reuneix algunes preguntes que els estudiants tenen per a mi. Qualsevol cosa que facis amb antelació per fer-ho sentir com un gran negoci anirà un llarg camí cap al compromís dels estudiants.<br/><br/>Posicioneu la càmera de vídeo o l'ordinador portàtil amb la càmera web perquè pugui veure la major part de l'audiència possible. És difícil avaluar el compromís dels estudiants quan només puc veure un parell d'estudiants.<br/><br/>Limita cada grup a 50 estudiants. És increïblement difícil involucrar grans grups a través de vídeo.<br/><br/>Vaig a passar ràpidament de tema a tema o poema a poema. Si us plau, recorda als estudiants que hauran d'escoltar atentament per entendre el que està passant.<br/><br/>De tant en tant, faig una mica de Reader's Theater amb els estudiants. Si t'envio alguna part de l'estudiant amb guió per endavant, imprimeix una còpia per a CADA sessió i tallar a trossos, si cal.<br/><br/>Durant la visita<br/><br/>Quan parlo d'un llibre, si teniu aquest llibre imprès, si us plau, agafeu-lo perquè els estudiants el vegin.<br/><br/>Ets el meu delegat. Sovint no puc trucar als estudiants i escoltar respostes individuals. Així que, podria dir, "Aconseguirem 3 idees. Aixequeu la mà si teniu una idea." A continuació, preneu el control, truqueu a tres estudiants i anuncieu aquestes respostes a tots els de l’aula i a mi.<br/><br/>Trieu estudiants confiats i sortints per parts d'estudiants amb guió (si n'envio cap amb antelació). Durant les meves visites presencials a l'escola, intento treure alguns dels estudiants menys confiats, però he trobat que això no funciona tan bé durant les visites virtuals perquè no els puc sentir.<br/><br/>Feu que els estudiants amb parts parlants s'asseguin al davant. Quan sigui el moment, aixequeu-los i recordeu-los que parlin en veu alta.<br/><br/>En les visites virtuals, la gestió del comportament recau únicament en tu. Sovint no puc veure exactament el que està passant, així que si us plau, interveniu segons sigui necessari. Si hi ha una gran interrupció, només em demana que aguanti un moment perquè no parli mentre ningú està prestant atenció:>)<br/><br/>Siéntase lliure de prendre fotos de mi a la pantalla i compartir en les xarxes socials, encara que les fotos de mi sovint semblen ridículs perquè estic fent cares divertides o alguna cosa mentre llegeixo!<br/><br/>Si teniu alguna pregunta, si us plau, pregunteu abans o durant la visita!<br/><br/>Programació d'una sessió virtual<br/><br/>Estàs interessat en programar una visita virtual amb mi? Només has d'enviar-me un correu electrònic per establir una data, i anirem des d'allà |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arxiu de notícies<br/><br/>Un nou llibre analitza les maneres d'abordar els desafiaments del VIH<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis amb Marjorie Human que va dissenyar la portada del llibre, Actuant sobre el VIH.<br/><br/>La pandèmia de VIH ha tret el millor i el pitjor dels humans en termes de resposta.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Paraula del dia: Opció<br/><br/>Opció: Un acord per mantenir oberta, per un període determinat, una oferta de venda o arrendament d'immobles. Es pot utilitzar una opció, per exemple, per donar al comprador temps per resoldre qüestions de finançament, títol, zonificació i viabilitat abans de comprometre el comprador a comprar. Les opcions s'utilitzen amb freqüència en el procés de muntatge del terreny. L'opció ha de ser recolzada per la seva consideració real, separada i independent del preu de compra de l'immoble. El simple consideració de consideració per si sola no és suficient excepte en una opció de lloguer en què les disposicions del contracte de lloguer són consideració suficient per donar suport a l'opció. Una opció simplement crea un dret contractual; no dóna a l'opcionat cap propietat en la propietat. En el moment de la signatura de l'opció, el propietari no ven, ni el comprador compra, la propietat. Tot i que el propietari està obligat a vendre si el comprador li avisa, el comprador no està obligat a comprar. Una opció de compra també es coneix com a trucada; una opció de venda es coneix com a put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Beneficis dels carotenoides per a la pell<br/><br/>Has sentit a parlar dels carotenoides? Aquests poderosos fitoquímics són els constituents pigmentats que es troben en les plantes que donen flors, fruites, i deixa els seus colors groc, taronja i vermell.<br/><br/>Des de la dècada de 1930, els científics han identificat uns 800 carotenoides i uns 40 es troben en el cos humà, incloent la capa més externa de l'epidermis, la dermis i el greix subcutani. Els carotenoides més comuns són beta-carotè, alfa-carotè, luteïna, zeaxantina, licopè i astaxantina. Podeu llegir més sobre astaxantina aquí.<br/><br/>El contingut de carotenoides a la pell està influenciat per nombrosos factors, com ara la ingesta de fruites i verdures, la seva biodisponibilitat a partir de diversos aliments, la suplementació, l'exposició a la radiació UV, la contaminació de l'aire, el consum d'alcohol, el tabaquisme i l'estrès.<br/><br/>Com ajuden els carotenoides a la pell?<br/><br/>Els carotenoides són alguns dels antioxidants més coneguts per a la pell i també tenen funcions importants com a agents antiinflamatoris.<br/><br/>Envelliment saludable i reparació de la pell<br/><br/>Els antioxidants són essencials per a una pell sana perquè ajuden a prevenir el dany dels radicals lliures a les cèl·lules. El dany dels radicals lliures provoca l'envelliment prematur i l'aparició de diversos tipus de càncers de pell. Els carotenoides, juntament amb la vitamina E, la vitamina C i l'enzim Co Q10 són importants antioxidants dérmics.<br/><br/>A causa de la seva activitat antioxidant, els carotenoides donen suport i fomenten la producció de col·lagen i elastina a la pell. Això ajuda a augmentar la densitat, el gruix, l'elasticitat i la fermesa de la pell. El col·lagen i l'elastina disminueixen a mesura que envellim, de manera que obtenir suficients carotenoides en la dieta i tòpicament és fonamental per envellir bé.<br/><br/>Els carotenoides poden millorar els signes de fotoenvelliment, la decoloració de la pell, l'elasticitat, la hidratació, la textura i poden reduir la pèrdua d'aigua transepidèrmica.<br/><br/>L'astaxantina, en particular, estimula els fibroblasts per produir col·lagen i elastina, inhibeix l'activitat dels enzims que descomponen col·lagen i elastina, i mostra efectes antiinflamatoris i filtres UV. S'ha demostrat que redueix la melanina a la pell, el que resulta en la disminució de l'aparició de les taques i el melasma.<br/><br/>Activitat antiacne: l'activitat antiinflamatòria dels carotenoides ajuda a amortir la inflamació i la irritació associada amb l'acne. Els carotenoides també ajuden a normalitzar i equilibrar les secrecions d'oli de les glàndules sebàcies. Són agents valuosos en la reparació de la pell i estimulen la regeneració epidèrmica, ajudant a suavitzar i suavitzar la pell.<br/><br/>On es poden trobar els carotenoides?<br/><br/>Hi ha dues maneres d'aconseguir la seva dosi diària de carotenoides: a través de la dieta i a través de l'aplicació tòpica. La combinació d'ambdós és l'enfocament ideal per a la cura de la pell de l'envelliment.<br/><br/>Els carotenoides són solubles en greix, de manera que el seu cos necessita greix per absorbir-los (pensa tomàquets i oli d'oliva, bròquil i mantega, o espinacs i alvocat). Les fonts comunes de carotenoides en els aliments són alvocat, rovells d'ou, col, espinacs, pastanagues, patates dolces, papaia i tomàquets.<br/><br/>Si bé advoquem per obtenir tants dels seus nutrients i antioxidants com sigui possible dels aliments en lloc de suplementació; un estudi va mostrar que l'astaxantina combinada amb hidrolitzat de col·lagen va millorar significativament la integritat de la barrera, va reduir la pèrdua d'aigua transepidèrmica, i va augmentar l'expressió de procol·lagen tipus I mRNA.<br/><br/>L'aplicació tòpica és clau per a una pell sana. Els estudis mostren que les altes concentracions d'antioxidants en la pell humana ofereixen la millor protecció per a una pell sana a qualsevol edat.<br/><br/>A Sarka Botanicals barregem plantes riques en carotenoides, plantes senceres com la calèndula, el lleó i extractes com l'astaxantina amb olis premsats en fred i ingredients funcionals. La calèndula sola conté més de 19 tipus diferents de carotenoides. Això pot explicar per què té una llarga història d'ús en la cura de la pell. Els estudis mostren que els carotenoides barrejats amb coenzim Q10 són especialment eficaços per reduir la inflamació i alentir l'envelliment prematur de la pell a causa de l'exposició al sol. |
