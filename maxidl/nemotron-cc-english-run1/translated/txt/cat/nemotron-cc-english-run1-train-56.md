| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Tot i reconèixer que és impossible argumentar a algú per estimar alguna cosa que odien, i viceversa, encara és sovint agradable intentar l'argument. Quan parlem amb persones les opinions de les quals contradiuen directament les nostres, ens veiem obligats a defensar els nostres gustos, definir les nostres opinions i analitzar per què reaccionem de la manera que ho fem. Per això tenim Why Don't You Like This?, en què dos dels nostres empleats intentaran descobrir si les persones amb opinions oposades poden anar més enllà de "No, estàs equivocat!" i tenir una discussió civil, constructiva, i possiblement fins i tot convincent sobre els seus punts de disputa. Perquè no importa el que digui la ràdio, encara hi ha un punt mitjà entre "Estem d'acord totalment" i "Tinc raó, i ets estúpid i dolent".<br/><br/>Scott: Des de discutir el meu Scott Pilgrim Vs. L'apostasia mundial, hem estat buscant un cas on pugui cridar a vostè per no agradar alguna cosa meravellosa, i no vam haver de buscar per molt temps. Estàvem asseguts l’un al costat de l’altre durant l’Hugo de Martin Scorsese, jo, completament encantat pel seu fantàstic homenatge a les meravelles del cinema mut primerenc, i tu, aparentment, en resistència a cada gir. El consens crític ha estat del meu costat: va aconseguir el lloc número 9 en el nostre col·lectiu Top 15 (encara que l'has catalogat com la teva opció sobrevalorada), ha guanyat (o col·locat) en diversos premis de la crítica cinematogràfica, i actualment gaudeix d'una puntuació de 83 a Metacritic. Això no vol dir que t'equivoquis, per descomptat, però és responsabilitat teva explicar per què Hugo era, en les teves paraules, "buit i artificial", on molts de nosaltres ho veiem com una encantadora evocació de la infància de Scorsese i el mitjà quan encara estava en la seva infància. Si us plau, si us plau, sigueu suaus mentre esquartereu aquesta papallona per les ales.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: No puc ser suau, Scott. De vegades fa menys mal si arrenques el Band-Aid d'una vegada. (I fins i tot si no ho fa, qui vol caminar amb un Band-Aid mig arrencat? Gross.) El fet és que vaig trobar que Hugo era un exercici de manipulació cansada en la falsificació, començant des del seu lliscament d'obertura a través d'una estació de tren de París, que em recordava més que res a The Polar Express de Robert Zemeckis. A diferència de Mike D'Angelo, sóc un fan de llarg, ininterromput pren com una manera d'establir un espai i encoratjar als espectadors a retenir inconscientment la respiració com una càmera explora una àrea; però quan l'espai que s'explora és una llisa, brillant creació CGI, i la càmera flota sense pes a través d'ell sense cap sentit físic que la càmera o l'entorn. I la resta de la pel·lícula em va semblar similarment sense porus i irreal, tant pel que fa a la seva ambientació com pel que fa a la seva història maliciosa i altament inventada.<br/><br/>No tinc necessàriament un problema amb els ambients fabricats i estilitzats de la pel·lícula. M'encantava l'obra de Baz Luhrmann, igual d'extensa i totalment artificial, sobre París al Moulin Rouge, per exemple, però aquesta pel·lícula té un sentit del seu propi ridícul, un sentit de l'humor sobre com de deliberadament exagerada és. Després de l’estilització de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularment en Amélie. (Tant Jeunet com Luhrmann sentien una forta influència visual aquí.) Vaig tenir la sensació, però, que Martin Scorsese volia que em prengués Hugo completament seriosament. Tot i que és una altra història dolorosament sentimental sobre un orfe atrevit que torna el color a la vida d'un vell maldestre.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>No hi ha res que gaudeixi més en el cinema que ser sorprès. I no hi ha res que resulti i resista més que ser manipulat obertament, ser dit en veu alta què sentir i quan sentir-ho. Una bona pel·lícula fa aquest tipus de coses subtilment; una dolenta utilitza senyals de música i cordes dolces - i en aquest cas, un orfe brut, d'ulls enormes i desencaixat mirant malament la càmera - per exigir pathos, i per dir als espectadors que són persones horribles si no serveixen a la demanda. Dit això, puc tractar amb nens tristos i adults rancorosos fent la vida millor els uns per als altres - realment vaig cavar Le Havre d'aquest any, que era essencialment la mateixa trama sense tota la valentia - però trobo que els ambients artificials es reflecteixen malament en les emocions artificials, i cadascun fa que l'altre sembli més fals per torns.<br/><br/>Comencem amb això. En el nostre vídeo de pel·lícules ignorades, tu i Noel vau portar a Keith a la tasca de defensar el Tiranosaure, perquè sentiu que no era prou realista: massa inventat, massa miserable, massa, massa lluny. Com és possible que no puguis comprar una vella manivela que trenca coses quan està enfadat, però pots comprar un orfe que viu dins d'un rellotge gegant de l'estació de tren i embarcar-te en un viatge extravagant per reparar un autòmat misteriós que creu que pot portar secrets del seu pare mort, però que en canvi el porta en un viatge peculiar d'autodescobriment, a la terra màgica del cinema? No heu trobat mai el disseny rococó d'Hugo, agressiu i agressiu, ni tan sols una mica excessiu o difícil d'empassar?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet i Luhrmann com a influències en Scorsese?! Oblida't de ser indelicat, ara m'estàs punxant deliberadament amb un pal afilat. Si busques inspiracions per a Hugo, de fet, si busques el nucli emocional d'Hugo, has de tornar a la infància de Scorsese a Elizabeth Street a Little Italy, on un nen asmàtic, incapaç de jugar a l'exterior amb els altres nens, es va retirar a les fantasies d'Alexander Korda com El lladre de Bagdad. O, més simplement, aneu directament a la font mateix: George Méliès, el viatge a la Lluna del qual segueix sent el Big Bang de totes les fantasies cinematogràfiques, aquell moment en què la càmera no era utilitzada per documentar el món tal com és, sinó qualsevol lloc extravagant, màgic, transportant que un cineasta vulgui inventar per a ell. I aquesta tradició s'ha desenvolupat i ampliat durant dècades abans que Jeunet i Luhrmann tinguessin les seves petites potes brutes.<br/><br/>I parlant de Jeunet, bonic intent de treure'm la meva arma retòrica, però ho diré de totes maneres: com pots estimar l'Amélie, però trobar l'Hugo sintètic i "excessiu" i "cansat de manipular"? Vostè diu que Amélie i Moulin Rouge han redimit "el sentit del seu propi ridícul" on Scorsese vol dir que ens prenem Hugo seriosament, i no crec que aquest sigui el cas, almenys en aquest últim punt. Que Scorsese sent una evident passió per les pel·lícules és, suposo, per què interpretes a Hugo com a seriós. Però per a mi, són aquests sentiments els que donen a la pel·lícula un llast emocional que les pel·lícules Luhrmann i Jeunet no tenen. Les tres pel·lícules fan un ús agressiu de les meravelles de CGI, i Scorsese afegeix 3D a la barreja, amb un efecte meravellós, però on tu i jo diferim és en el tema de l'ingravidesa. Estic d'acord que el CGI té un efecte de distanciament; mons composts enterament de plasticina digital són flexibles fins al punt que de vegades no tenen presència. Vostè es va referir a Hugo en la seva entrada "Overrated" per a la nostra peça Best Of Film com "una gimcrack CGI" - una dis... perfecta per a una altra pel·lícula.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>És just dir que Scorsese ha construït Hugo al voltant d'una trama estàndard de llibres per a nens / pel·lícules: Orphean troba a faltar el seu pare, crea el seu propi món de fantasia, s'aferra a un nou amic, convenç a un vell fuddy-duddy per suavitzar-se i potser adoptar-lo. Però això és només l'esquelet narratiu, i Scorsese proporciona molta carn i sang. Per una banda, no es pot veure a Hugo, el noi solitari, mirant des de les torres del rellotge a l'agitació d'una estació de tren de París sense pensar en Scorsese, un altre noi solitari, mirant per la finestra de la seva habitació al carrer Elizabeth. I fins i tot si no ets prou gran com per fer aquesta connexió, realment sento que el viatge d'Hugo no és trobar una nova figura paterna, sinó persistir amb la màgia mecànica que es manté com el llegat del seu propi pare. La persistència de la visió que ens permet acceptar una versió il·lusòria del món a 24 fotogrames per segon és ciència i màgia alhora. La relació d'Hugo amb Méliès no es tracta d'acostar-se a un nou pare, sinó que comparteix un entusiasme comú que el vell s'ha submergit en l'amargor. Per a mi, aquest és un angle molt més únic en una premissa potencialment desgastada.<br/><br/>Fins i tot els pocs detractors de la pel·lícula semblen disposats a admetre que les seqüències que evoquen la història del cinema i l'estudi de Méliès, amb Michael Stuhlbarg com l'heroi acadèmic del cinema, eren fantàstiques. Se sentia, de la millor manera possible, com una embriagadora compressió de la meva classe History Of Film 101 a la universitat, condensant el valor d'un semestre de clips i context en alguna cosa entre un muntatge i un llibre animat. I parla de l'enginyós disseny de la pel·lícula, que capta els fets i la fantasia tan bellament que és alhora una història de Méliès i el naixement del cinema, i només el tipus de meravella cinematogràfica simple, sumptuosament produïda que el mateix Scorsese hauria estimat de nen. Gràcies a Déu, Hugo no segueix el model de Jeunet/Luhrmann i té "un sentit del seu propi ridícul". Com a coneixedor de fantasia tu mateix, no diries que val la pena jugar-ho de manera directa i seriosa i desvergonyida en lloc d'aixecar un cop d'ull a l'audiència? Pot ser que trobis Hugo malaltís dolç, però no crec que l'autenticitat del seu sentiment sigui negada.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Sí, de fet vaig trobar parts d'Hugo encantadores. (Nota com estic responent a la teva pregunta per endavant, mentre que vostè estava massa ocupat escumant amb apoplexia per abordar la meva, encara que suposo que és una resposta en el seu propi dret. D'acord, "influència" pot estar exagerant el cas - només volia dir que l'estil visual semblava molt familiar. Tot i que, com Keith va assenyalar quan vas comentar això en persona, Scorsese no s'oposa ni a inspirar-se en les imatges d'altres persones, ni és immune a això.) Principalment, em van encantar les parts que tractaven de la història de Georges Méliès, amb el seu amor pel cinema, amb el treball que va posar en el seu art i l’alegria que en va treure. Hi ha una gran quantitat de bellesa i diversió en l'escenificació de l'escena subaquàtica de "Fairyland" de Méliès, i en la seqüència al final, centrant-se en les imatges de Méliès. Us asseguro que la connexió d'Hugo amb Méliès sobre un amor compartit pel cinema és un toc agradable. I gaudeixo d'una bona pel·lícula sobre el cinema.<br/><br/>Però Hugo no es tracta principalment de cinema, malgrat els vincles de Méliès. A més dels temes que cites, també es tracta de trobar el teu propòsit, com els personatges expliquen expressament, laboriosament entre ells i per a nosaltres. I es tracta de l'espectacle, i grans peces d'acció, i persecucions, i finals feliços per sempre on fins i tot el valent enfadat i la tímida parella més gran i els fergawdsakes fins i tot el cranky dachshund tots s'aparellen amb encantadors interessos amorosos al final. Es tracta de la super precoç Hermione Granger-tipus ser bossy i perky i intel·ligent i lloant els mons màgics tancats en llibres. I tot aquest negoci és molt familiar, i molt artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sí, Scorsese està jugant amb arquetips. El problema és que mai vaig sentir que els impregnava de res nou, fresc o creïble, malgrat la seva pròpia història. Hauria preferit una història sobre un jove Scorsese que creix amb asma, una cosa a petita escala i real, sense grans habitacions plenes de rellotgeria CGI i paraules de pols brillants d'or i somnis profètics i una guarda tirànica adulta enfurismada amb un cor d'or, tot això és una ximpleria sobredimensionada. Continues citant els antecedents personals de Scorsese i l'amor pel cinema com a evidència que realment està sentint el que està posant a la pantalla, però no sento el seu toc personal en res d'això, excepte els moments que són expressament sobre el cinema. Les emocions centrals poden ser reals, però això no fa que l'execució sigui menys falsa.<br/><br/>Vostè diu que l'autenticitat de l'emoció no s'ha de negar. No qüestiono si Scorsese personalment se sentia sol i aïllat quan era un nen, però no sento solitud i aïllament a la pantalla - veig un munt de significants exagerats (Hugo és brut i la seva roba es desgasta i tots els adults li criden i regularment se'l persegueix un gos espantós!) i grans batecs, amb crits i plors i Spielbergian mera. Per a mi, la sinceritat és més convincent i més personal quan és tranquil i directe; quan algú està cridant les seves opinions a mi, suposo que està realment enfadat, o simplement tractant d'aclaparar els meus sentits per impedir-me expressar la meva pròpia opinió. L'Hugo va ser un crit llarg, pel que a mi em preocupava.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Per què no vaig tenir aquesta sensació de falsedat de l'Amélie, et preguntes? De fet, ho vaig fer. Reconeixeré completament que Amélie i Moulin Rouge són construccions grans, manipuladores i artificials en la mateixa veta, que exigeixen emocions específiques a intervals específics, i que intenten vendre aquestes emocions amb emocions pesades i una banda sonora agressiva. Cap d'ells realment em va vendre les seves emocions com un autèntic sentiment humà. El que em va agradar d'aquestes dues pel·lícules va ser la construcció, en particular les enigmàtiques i risibles llistes d'Amélie de característiques i experiències que caracteritzen a l'atzar el seu repartiment, i les mashups i recontextualitzacions musicals-magpie del Moulin Rouge. Sovint em venen històries que fan coses creatives o ambicioses amb estructura, i ambdues pel·lícules qualifiquen, on Hugo és una missió infantil molt més lineal i estàndard.<br/><br/>Però al final, per a mi, realment es redueix a la sensació que aquestes pel·lícules són ximpleries, mentre que Hugo està destinat a ser pres seriosament en cada moment traïdor. No creus que això sigui cert, però al mateix temps estàs defensant la seva integritat en termes de la seva absolutament autèntica, arrelada en l'emoció de la història de Scorsese, i dient-me que estic equivocat, i ell no vol dir que sigui pres seriosament. Com conciliar aquestes dues afirmacions? Què passa amb la pel·lícula suggereix que no està destinat a ser pres al valor nominal? I és possible que aquest sigui només un altre cas curiós de la situació semblant a la de Benjamin Button, on trobo que l'ús dels nens en les pel·lícules de gran pressupost és en gran part sapigut i melodramàtic, mentre que vostè com a pare troba que eludeix el seu cinisme i va directament al seu sentiment familiar?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: No estic segur que volia dir que Scorsese no vol dir ser pres seriosament; és només que ha triat un vehicle extravagant a través del qual expressar un amor seriós per les pel·lícules. Quan dius: "Però Hugo no es tracta principalment de cinema, malgrat els lligams de Méliès", estic desconcertat. Us admeto que trobeu molts elements d’Hugo massa familiars i laboriosos i plens d’emocions meravelloses de Spielberg: no hi ha res que pugui fer per discutir sobre aquesta percepció, que comparteixen altres dubtadors d’Hugo. De vegades una pel·lícula significa encant i encant, i per a alguns no; tens l'Hugo i jo tinc l'Amélie, encara que crec que aquesta última, deliberadament artificial com és, significa per a nosaltres trobar-la romàntica. (En lloc de, per exemple, algun horrible aparell mecànic adequat per a una seqüela de Saw.)<br/><br/>Però dir que Hugo no es tracta principalment de pel·lícula? Si no es tracta de pel·lícula, llavors és la història més discursiva sense sentit sobre [el que creus que és] que he vist mai. La relació entre Hugo i Méliès és el cor de la pel·lícula, i en el cor d’això no és només una connexió entre Plucky Orphelan i Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, sinó una afinitat compartida per la màgia d’enginyeria, específicament la màgia de les pel·lícules. Crec que Scorsese i els seus col·laboradors han trobat una manera d'expressar el seu entusiasme durant els primers dies del cinema a través d'una fantasia accessible a totes les edats. El conte infantil ple d'arquetips és la mera escorça aquí; el cinema és el pastís. (Mmmmm... pastís.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Pel que fa al curiós cas de Benjamin Button, no veig gaire de connexió, a part d'intentar exposar-me com un defensor de Benjamin Button com una manera de danyar la meva credibilitat. (Per cert, com són els extres en aquest G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) T'he dit que el nou pare privat de son en mi potser era vulnerable a Benjamin Button, però no puc imaginar un moment en què la premissa de l'envelliment a l'inrevés no em mogués. I a més, no veig com Benjamin Button es relaciona molt amb Hugo com una pel·lícula sobre nens, ja que això és només un petit segment d'una història que abasta una trajectòria molt més gran.<br/><br/>Així que t'he convençut? Probablement no. Però estic content d'assabentar-me que Hugo no estava completament desproveït d'encanteris per a tu. Les seqüències sobre Méliès el cineasta són el que va posar Hugo per a mi, i en això, almenys, podem compartir un cert amor pel cinema.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: No, no puc dir que m'hagis convençut, més del que t'he convençut. És impossible argumentar a ningú en un amor visceral de qualsevol cosa, i realment hauria de ser igualment impossible convèncer algú de l'amor visceral. Sobretot, m'heu deixat veure Hugo a Scott-O-Vision, que és una experiència interessant; almenys ara estic lleugerament convençut que d'alguna manera no vam aconseguir veure pel·lícules completament diferents que d'alguna manera tenien el mateix nom i director.<br/><br/>Certament vam tenir diferents experiències, però, i en la meva ment, centrat en diferents aspectes de la producció: encara no veig el tema "la pel·lícula és meravellosa" com el fil únic de la pel·lícula, tant com un entre molts. "Sense sentit discursiu" gairebé la cobreix, encara que jo llençaria "sovint innecessàriament bonica i preciosa" a més d'això. Mentre et concentres en el saborós farcit de pastís de la pel·lícula, sento que aquest pastís estava cobert amb una lliura de sucre cristal·litzat, i crec que això fa una diferència, independentment del missatge central de la pel·lícula o d'un grapat d'escenes fantàstiques. Vegeu també Benjamin Button, que no he mencionat només per enganyar-vos: realment crec que teniu més sentimentalisme que jo pel que fa als nens al cinema, especialment quan s'utilitzen més com a símbols de vulnerabilitat i innocència que com a personatges humans. Ei, saps quina pel·lícula totalment no té bonics moppets d'ulls amples que portin esperança a un món cínic? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Potser aniré a veure aquests extres de Blu-ray. Podria utilitzar una mica d'explosió-insulina per compensar la dolçor d'Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Esperava que la meva filla estigués lliure dels moments difícils i preocupants": la història de Mee Mee com a mare refugiada<br/><br/>L'esperança en temps de crisi: la història d'un dia de la mare<br/><br/>Per Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee va sentir que els soldats venien. Va agafar el seu fill i es va unir frenèticament a la resta dels vilatans que corrien cap a la frontera entre Tailàndia i Birmània, on es trobava l'Oficina de l'Alt Comissionat de les Nacions Unides per als Refugiats (ACNUR). El seu marit estava en un altre poble corrent en la direcció oposada, Mee va saber més tard. Després que la persecució dels soldats acabés, Mee va tornar a casa al seu petit poble a Koechi, Birmània.<br/><br/>Durant 1997-2000, Mee i milers de persones com ella van viure sota l'amenaça constant de la violència dels soldats birmans. Moltes persones es refugiaven temporalment a la selva, i tornaven a casa al seu poble després que els soldats abandonessin la zona, només per fer-ho de nou dies després. Aproximadament un cop a la setmana, Mee i altres estarien en moviment per evitar la captura, violació o mort per soldats.<br/><br/>Durant un incident, el marit de Mee va córrer per davant de la seva dona per assegurar menjar per a la seva família. La bala va trencar una part de la seva gàbia toràcica, deixant-lo greument ferit i en perill mentre viatjava cap a la selva amb la seva família per seguretat.<br/><br/>Durant tres mesos, el marit de Mee va amagar i traslladar la família amb una ferida exasperant al seu costat. No va rebre cap atenció mèdica, excepte la cura de Mee.<br/><br/>"Vaig tenir por de tornar a Birmània", va dir Mee a través d'un intèrpret. "Vaig tenir por de morir. Vaig plorar i plorar cada dia", va continuar.<br/><br/>El marit de Mee finalment va agafar prou força per caminar cinc dies cap a un petit poble de Tailàndia on van aprendre la ubicació d'un hospital i un camp de refugiats. Quan Mee i el seu marit finalment van arribar a l'hospital, es va sotmetre a una cirurgia immediata i més tard es va recuperar.<br/><br/>Símbol de l'esperança<br/><br/>La vida a la jungla per als soldats birmans que fugien era de fet aterridora i difícil. Les tendes improvisades de bambú amb només cobertes de sostre i sòl es van convertir en habitatges temporals adequats. Moltes dones, incloent-hi Mee, van donar a llum a nens a la selva. El fill de Mee, llavors de sis anys, va ajudar en el lliurament de la seva germana anomenada Eh Ku Hser. El seu nom significa amor - fred - dolç. "Fred" en la cultura birmana significa per no passar pel foc de la vida, ja que la calor representa temps difícils.<br/><br/>"Esperava que la meva filla estigués lliure de moments difícils i preocupants", va dir Mee. "No volia que passés pel que havia experimentat", va continuar.<br/><br/>Per a Mee, el naixement de la seva filla enmig de la foscor, el turment i la por, va ser un símbol d'esperança per a una nova vida per venir. L'esperança en temps de crisi, la mateixa premissa del Comitè Metodista Unit d'Ajuda (UMCOR) recentment co-marcat UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, és també l'essència d'allò que les espelmes il·luminen.<br/><br/>Un nou començament<br/><br/>Amb l'ajuda de l'ACNUR, l'esperança d'una nova vida es va materialitzar per a Mee i la seva família quan es van reassentar a West Springfield, Massachusetts. Allà, Mee va conèixer Moo Kho Paw, una altra dona que va emigrar de Birmània, i que treballava a Prosperity Candle a Florència. L'organització ajuda les dones refugiades que han escapat de zones de conflicte a reconstruir les seves vides a través de l'art de la fabricació d'espelmes. Moo Kho va recomanar que Mee s'unís a l'organització, i Mee va acceptar amb gust.<br/><br/>"Estava emocionada d'estar fora de casa", va dir Mee, "m'han criat per creure que, com que era una dona, el meu paper era quedar-me a casa i criar la meva família", va continuar. "Tot i que moltes dones birmanes volen fer més per si mateixes, sovint se les anima a seguir sent mestresses de casa".<br/><br/>Avui, Mee té plans d'entrar en el negoci de la fabricació d'espelmes per si mateixa i donar suport als seus cinc fills, però va expressar la necessitat d'aprendre anglès primer.<br/><br/>"Al camp de refugiats tailandesos, teníem educació, però no era tan bona", va dir Mee. "Quan era un nen, volia anar a l'escola, però em van dir que em quedés a casa perquè era una dona. Ara tinc l'esperança que les meves filles puguin anar a la universitat i convertir-se en metges o policies", va continuar Mee.<br/><br/>Mee ha trobat un equilibri en la seva vida que desitjaria que els altres haguessin trobat: una vida senzilla i feliç on el treball, la cura dels membres de la família i la llibertat d'elecció tinguin el seu lloc.<br/><br/>Donar suport a les dones refugiades als Estats Units<br/><br/>Comparteix aquesta història del Dia de la Mare amb els teus éssers estimats. I, quan compreu espelmes fetes a mà per Mee, Moo Kho i Naw, una altra dona refugiada birmana que treballa a Prosperity Candle, sabeu que esteu ajudant a mantenir els seus mitjans de vida mentre reconstrueixen les seves vides i les dels seus familiars als Estats Units. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | L'assaig de precedència<br/><br/>1562 paraules - 7 pàgines<br/><br/>L'acció afirmativa és una política governamental que dóna oportunitats a les minories, les dones i qualsevol grup que hagi estat víctima de discriminació en el passat. L'acció afirmativa és el resultat del moviment pels drets civils de la dècada de 1960, que va sorgir de la Llei de drets civils de 1964 que va prohibir la discriminació basada en la raça, l'ètnia o el gènere. Va ser la decisió de la Cort Suprema de 1978, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, que va permetre l'ús de preferències basades en la raça com a mitjà per fomentar la diversitat, permetent que l'acció afirmativa s'utilitzi en les polítiques d'admissió. Va ser creat amb la intenció de proporcionar igualtat d'oportunitats per als membres dels grups minoritaris en l'educació i ...veure al mig del document ...<br/><br/>No obstant això, segons un informe de 2007 del Pew Research Center, el suport a l'acció afirmativa entre el públic nord-americà ha augmentat substancialment en els últims anys, passant del 58% el 1995 al 70% el 2007. Els partidaris de l'acció afirmativa fan molts arguments en suport de l'acció afirmativa, amb l'esperança d'aconseguir que els altres vegin el bé genuí que les polítiques d'actina afirmativa porten a la nostra societat. Els partidaris creuen que l'acció afirmativa és més un procés que una política d'admissió. Col·legis i universitats prenen la iniciativa extra per arribar a grups minoritaris, animant-los a aplicar. Col·legis i universitats ofereixen ajuda financera addicional i proporcionen recursos en el campus per ajudar a millorar l'educació universitària de l'estudiant. Els partidaris també observen l'augment del nombre de sol·licituds minoritàries a col·legis i universitats, en part a causa de les polítiques d'acció afirmativa.<br/>Les estadístiques han demostrat que quan s'elimina l'acció afirmativa, com quan va ser a Berkley College i UCLA el 1998, les admissions d'estudiants minoritaris van caure un 61% i un 36% respectivament, demostrant que l'acció afirmativa juga un paper important en el procés d'admissió d'estudiants minoritaris a la universitat. Els partidaris de l'acció afirmativa també creuen que la diversitat en l'educació superior proporciona un millor ambient educatiu per a tots els estudiants, personalment i intel·lectualment. Si s'eliminessin les accions afirmatives, hi hauria menys estudiants minoritaris matriculats a les universitats, el que faria que la diversitat fos bastant escassa. Les polítiques d'acció afirmativa també són necessàries per compensar segles d'opressió racial, econòmica i social. Les persones amb un estatus socioeconòmic més alt tenen més oportunitats que les de menors orígens socioeconòmics. Els partidaris creuen que certs grups racials o ètnics estan en desavantatge perquè sovint es troben en llars de baixos ingressos i, en conseqüència, no estan exposats als mateixos recursos que els estudiants de classes socioeconòmiques superiors. Els defensors donen suport a la noció de competència entre estudiants basada en el mèrit, però argumenten que l'acció afirmativa compensa les diferències econòmiques. Els graduats universitaris, que s'han beneficiat de l'acció afirmativa, també han dit que van rebre millors llocs de treball, van guanyar més diners i, en general, viuen millors vides a causa de les oportunitats afortunades que van rebre a través de l'acció afirmativa.<br/>Els partidaris de l'acció afirmativa subratllen contínuament la grave importància de l'acció afirmativa, tenint en compte les seves contribucions a millorar tant l'experiència universitària com la societat en general. No obstant això, els opositors de l'acció afirmativa creuen que ha arribat el moment de posar fi a l'acció afirmativa. Els opositors creuen que l'acció afirmativa es va crear per garantir pràctiques d'admissió justes per portar el canvi a un llarg període de discriminació racial. Creuen que la política està obsoleta."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinacions<br/><br/>Les combinacions són defenses contra un cop de puny, respostes coreografades a diferents tipus d'atacs. Tenen molts noms a través de les arts marcials però (en la meva experiència) cada art té una versió d'ells. Això les fa diferents de les formes perquè hi ha moltes arts marcials que no tenen formes. Què fa que els exercicis de parella siguin tan universals? Per què practicar una resposta específica quan (en realitat) el temps, el tipus d'atac, la mida de l'atacant i un centenar d'altres factors ho faran perquè mai utilitzeu tota aquesta resposta coreografiada? I, finalment, com podem practicar per a una situació de defensa real i evitar lesions al mateix temps?<br/><br/>La universalitat de les combinacions és impressionant, per dir el mínim. El nostre estil de karate Kenpo té una llista de 108 combos que es poden aprendre. (La majoria dels estudiants només aprenen 20-30 però) En el Jiu-Jitsu brasiler passes classes senceres practicant barres de braços i estrangulaments, aprenent totes les subtileses del moviment mentre que la teva parella ofereix poca o cap resistència. Cada boxejador ha passat hores davant de la bossa i / o mirall llançant la mateixa combinació de cops de puny fins que el seu cos es mou només per reflex. Les combinacions són universals perquè no tenim millor manera d’introduir el moviment i després practicar les posicions subtils necessàries per fer-les funcionar. Colpejar un petit punt de pressió a través de la roba requereix molta pràctica, atrapar una barra de braços amb control requereix un maluc acuradament col·locat i una configuració furtiva, i una gran combinació només és útil si es pot travessar des d'una posició equilibrada i protegida. Pots pensar en una millor manera d’aconseguir aquestes habilitats?<br/><br/>Hi ha una sèrie de factors que determinen com respons a un atac i si en un sparring match o en una baralla, MAI he utilitzat una combinació completa en la meva defensa. Per què, llavors, passem hores practicant-los? Practiquem aquestes respostes coreografades perquè l'objectiu no és treure la combinació 8 cada vegada que veus un punxó de ganxo sinó mostrar-te una manera de bloquejar-lo i després una possible manera de seguir-lo. Mai he triat utilitzar la combinació 3 en una situació de realitat però el bloc és un dels meus moviments de go-to. Les combinacions afegeixen eines a la caixa d'eines que no arreglen el cotxe.<br/><br/>L'última pregunta és una qüestió de seguretat. Si practiquem pel bé de la realitat necessitem replicar la realitat. Com evitem lesions mentre ho fem? Quan es redueix a això, es tracta de construir confiança. Comencem a poc a poc i aprenem a confiar que tenim control sobre nosaltres mateixos. Aprenem a confiar que els nostres socis també tenen control. A mesura que aprenem a confiar en el nostre control sobre la nostra parella i (una mica més aterridor) aprenem a confiar en el control de la nostra parella sobre nosaltres. Al final (amb molta pràctica) es pot moure són a tota velocitat, llançar la seva parella, i ser llançat sense por de lesions.<br/><br/>Les combinacions són universals per una raó; es practiquen perquè puguin ser disseccionades en les seves parts, i ens mantenim segurs començant lent i construint confiança. Com amb tot en les arts marcials, les combinacions tenen moltes raons darrere de la seva pràctica i execució. |
