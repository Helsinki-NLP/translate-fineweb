| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Per exemple, l'Article VI, Clàusula 2 de la Constitució Americana té les disposicions que "tots els tractats ... han de ser la llei suprema de la terra." Tot i que és evident que els tractats per si sols no tenen el mateix efecte que les lleis federals. En realitat, només esdevenen operatives una vegada que aquestes disposicions entren en vigor com a llei federal amb l'aprovació del Senat i de la Presidència. Tot i que aquesta és la pràctica, és un principi generalment acceptat en el dret internacional que certs tractats tenen un efecte vinculant en els països. El tractat ha de complir el requisit de ser un tractat d'auto-execució per afectar el país sense cap legislatura nacional corresponent directament.<br/><br/>Això planteja la pregunta sobre quin tractat es qualificarà com a "autoexecutiu" i quin no?<br/><br/>Si un tractat és un tractat d'auto-execució o no és decidit pels jutges nacionals sobre una base cas per cas (Buergenthal, 1992). Per tal d'entendre això, l'article analitzarà primer els dos tipus de teories seguides pels països sobre la naturalesa dels tractats que s'apliquen al dret intern. Aquestes dues teories són el monisme i el dualisme. Bàsicament veuen el marc del dret nacional i internacional com una única jerarquia i dues jerarquies separades, respectivament (Wildhaber, 1971). Els països que segueixen el monisme creuen que certs tractats són immediatament vinculants i tenen un efecte immediat sobre el país. Una vegada que el tractat ha estat ratificat, es pot invocar en els tribunals nacionals i es considera que forma part de la llei del país. Els països que segueixen el dualisme creuen que un tractat no afecta el dret intern fins que no hagi estat reforçat per una legislatura aprovada al parlament. Un exemple de dualisme és com la Convenció Europea de Drets Humans es va fer operativa al Regne Unit després de l'aprovació de la Llei de Drets Humans de 1998 al seu parlament (Lleis, 2000).<br/><br/>El dret internacional és divers, i també ho són els tipus de procediments que segueixen diferents països per a l'acceptació de tractats. Algunes constitucions esmenten els procediments per a la ratificació d'un tractat. Alguns països fins i tot tenen un tracte diferent al dret internacional de tractats i al dret internacional consuetudinari. Certes organitzacions internacionals com la Unió Europea sovint afecten el dret intern dels seus estats membres. Els estats membres de la Unió Europea han de donar efecte a certes formes de legislatura comunitària. Tot i que, té una diferència essencial dels tractats d'auto-execució. La diferència és que no correspon als jutges nacionals decidir si les disposicions són autoexecutives o no, sinó que correspon al Tribunal Europeu de Justícia interpretar-les en virtut dels seus tractats constitutius. Altres formes de dret internacional formades a través de resolucions o tals poden no tenir el mateix efecte per a aquests estats. No obstant això, podrien considerar-les com a formes de "dret suau" i mirar-les per interpretar la intenció de la llei. De vegades, les proclamacions fetes pels òrgans judicials d'organitzacions internacionals com la Cort Interamericana de Drets Humans afecten els seus estats membres. Tot i que aquestes proclamacions no són vinculants per als estats membres, els jutges nacionals semblen referir-se a aquests per a una interpretació autoritzada.<br/><br/>Per tant, s'ha d'adoptar un enfocament cas per cas mentre s'analitzen els procediments i els precedents establerts en diferents països. Per examinar el concepte de tractats d'autoexecució, aquest article compararà els precedents establerts per diferents jurisdiccions. Si el lector desitja realitzar una anàlisi similar, pot fer-ho mirant els diferents anuaris nacionals de dret internacional. Principalment, aquests anuaris tindran una secció dedicada a la relació entre dret internacional i nacional.<br/><br/>Jurisprudència internacional:<br/><br/>La qüestió més important que sorgeix per als tribunals nacionals és si el tractat és autoexecutable? Si el tractat es pot aplicar sense que s'hagi aprovat cap legislació interna addicional per reforçar-lo. Aquesta qüestió es va plantejar en el cas de Czesław S v Tresor de l'Estat i Ministre del Tresor de l'Estat, en què el Tribunal Constitucional polonès va dictaminar que, ja que les disposicions del tractat es referien a les mesures internes que s'havien de prendre, el tractat no era de naturalesa autoexecutiva (Reclamacions del riu Bug, Czesław S v Tresor de l'Estat i Ministre del Tresor de l'Estat, 2003). Essencialment, quan el tractat es refereix a les mesures internes que s'han de prendre, no crea en si mateix noves obligacions, sinó que reforça la intenció del tractat perquè el procés jurídic intern prengui mesures per al mateix. Una qüestió similar es va plantejar en el cas Sosa als Estats Units d'Amèrica. En aquest cas, el tribunal va considerar si el Pacte Internacional de Drets Civils i Polítics era un tractat d'autoexecució. La Cort Suprema dels Estats Units també ha declarat que el Pacte Internacional de Drets Civils i Polítics no és un tractat d'autoexecució (Court, 2004). El Tribunal Suprem Federal de Suïssa també va examinar la naturalesa autoexecutiva del Pacte Internacional de Drets Civils i Polítics. La qüestió davant del tribunal era si l'article 13 (2) (b) i (c) eren autoexecutius en la naturalesa. El tribunal va examinar si el tractat era parcialment autoexecutiu i ho va fer comprovant si hi havia un contingut bàsic mínim perquè el tractat fos aplicable. El tribunal va considerar que no trobava tal disposició dins del tractat (A i B contra el Govern del Cantó de Zuric, 2000).<br/><br/>És essencial entendre que aquestes qüestions difereixen de la qüestió fonamental de si el dret internacional es pot aplicar com a part del dret de la terra? Per respondre a aquesta pregunta, el document examinarà la sentència del Tribunal Suprem de la República Dominicana. El Tribunal Suprem va declarar que l'article 3 de la Constitució de la República Dominicana va fer el dret internacional vinculant en l'ordre jurídic nacional. El tribunal va rebutjar la interpretació del Tribunal Superior de la Terra que aquests tractats eren "legislatura estrangera" i no formaven part de l'ordre jurídic intern. El Tribunal Suprem va establir que tots els tractats ratificats per la República Dominicana formaven part de la llei dominicana i, per tant, poden denominar-se autoexecutius (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción i ors, 1997). El Tribunal Suprem Federal de Suïssa ha examinat si el Tractat de Libson era autoexecutiu i directament aplicable a les universitats suïsses. Segons la jurisprudència pertinent, una norma del tractat és directament aplicable si el seu contingut és prou precís i clar per formar la base d'una decisió en un cas particular. Per tant, la norma ha de ser justiciable, és a dir, definir els drets i obligacions d'un individu i dirigir-se a les autoritats competents" (X contra Universitat de Lucerna, 2014). Això implica que si el tractat és directament aplicable o no, depèn de si la norma és justiciable. El Tractat de Lisboa es basa en el principi de les qualificacions adquirides a bord. Això es transmet a través de l'article IV (1) del tractat. El propòsit era crear una obligació per als estats de demostrar que el seu procés de presa de decisions és just, transparent i no discriminatori. La responsabilitat de demostrar que el sol·licitant no ha complert els criteris exigits recau en l'"òrgan que realitza l'avaluació". El tractat garanteix les garanties procedimentals, que són generalment acceptades pels països i, per tant, el tribunal va considerar que aquest tractat era autoexecutiu. Això mostra les diferents interpretacions que realitzen els tribunals de diversos països.<br/><br/>És essencial observar si les normes establertes pels tractats s'estan complint realment. Les lleis de casos de diverses jurisdiccions han subratllat que els tribunals nacionals són l'autoritat final sobre la qüestió de si un tractat és autoexecutable. També hi ha un deure inherent als països per a l'observança i l'execució deguda dels tractats. Aquest és el cas per la regla Pacta Sunt Servanda consagrada en l'article 26 de la Convenció de Viena sobre el Dret dels Tractats (VCLT). L'article 27 continua reforçant-lo afirmant que no es poden ignorar les obligacions del dret internacional utilitzant el dret intern com a justificació. Els tribunals de molts països l'han utilitzat com a font d'interpretació, com el Tribunal Constitucional de Letònia. En el cas d'una norma nacional en conflicte amb una norma internacional, el tribunal va considerar que la norma nacional era nul·la. Per arribar a la seva conclusió, el tribunal va confiar fermament en l'execució necessària dels tractats de bona fe tal com es preveu a l'article 26 del VCLT (Linija v Letònia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusió:<br/><br/>A partir d'això, és clar que els tractats tenen requisits particulars abans de poder ser considerats autoexecutius. No obstant això, mantenint tot això de banda, el més important segueix sent la interpretació dels tribunals nacionals. Els tribunals nacionals decideixen si el tractat es pot anomenar autoexecutiu o no. Tot i que la seva Constitució podria contenir una disposició sobre la llei dels tractats com a llei suprema del país, els tribunals de diferents països interpreten aquestes disposicions de maneres diferents. Això es pot veure com les Constitucions dels Estats Units i de la República Dominicana contenen aquestes disposicions, però segueixen interpretacions completament diferents de les mateixes. El terme "autoexecució" pot no ser congruent per a aquests tractats, ja que, en la pràctica, encara necessiten l'aprovació dels tribunals nacionals. Idealment, el camí a seguir hauria de ser que els països reconeguin la naturalesa autoexecutiva dels tractats i els tractin d'una manera en què es respectin els articles 26 i 27 del VCLT. Una vegada més, aquesta és la situació "ideal" i no és probable que trobi el seu camí en la pràctica estatal de certes jurisdiccions en un futur pròxim. Tot i això, l’esperança es pot guanyar mirant les interpretacions dels tribunals nacionals que respecten aquestes normes i esperem que preparin el camí perquè altres tribunals ho reconeguin.<br/><br/>Referències:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Tragèdies darrere de les escenes que van afectar el repartiment de la captura més mortal de la televisió<br/><br/>Reducció de les quotes de pesca<br/><br/>Tot i que la tripulació de Deadliest Catch guanya la majoria dels seus diners amb Discovery, això no vol dir que en realitat no venguin el seu transport. Per tant, es podria dir que tenen dues fonts d'ingressos, que és una cosa que la majoria de la gent en la seva línia de treball no tenen.<br/><br/>No obstant això, el 2017, el Departament de Pesca i Caça d'Alaska va començar un sistema de quotes, que limitava la quantitat de peix que qualsevol vaixell de pesca podia portar de tornada a la costa a la meitat. Això va significar que la tripulació de Deadliest Catch va experimentar una caiguda enorme en els beneficis durant diversos anys. Ei, almenys tenen Discovery per pagar les factures, oi? |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Fes un cop d'ull a la nostra col·lecció de blogs escrits per companys de feina.<br/><br/>BLOGS INFORMACIONALS<br/><br/>No ho estressis<br/><br/>Preguntes Freqüents - FAQ<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Setembre 12, 2020<br/><br/>L'estrès, no importa com de grans les coses van, que sempre pot trobar una manera d'aixecar el seu cap lleig. Ja sigui una sol·licitud de feina d'última hora o un paper que va oblidar escriure i és degut al dia següent, l'estrès sempre pot trobar una manera en el seu dia si ho permet. Avui us ensenyaré algunes coses que podeu fer per eliminar o prevenir l’estrès.<br/><br/>El primer que pot fer és fer exercici. L'exercici és una gran manera d'alleujar l'estrès, ja que disminueix l'hormona de l'estrès en el seu cos conegut com a cortisol. Els nivells més baixos de cortisol en el seu cos, com més baix sigui el seu nivell d'estrès. L'exercici també pot augmentar la seva confiança, i quan la seva confiança està amunt, llavors el seu estrès és generalment avall. Per a mi, quan em sento estressada, sempre faig exercici anant al gimnàs i practicant boxa, m’ajuda a cremar calories i reduir l’estrès mentre m’ho passo bé.<br/><br/>Escriure les coses ha estat una manera de calmar la gent durant molt de temps, i és el següent tema a la nostra llista. Escriure el que està fent estressat és una manera de netejar la ment, i ajuda a desfer-se de l'estrès també. Tinc una experiència similar a l'hora d'escriure històries, normalment si no puc pensar en una idea nova a causa d'una vella, escriuré la vella idea i hi pensaré. És llavors quan comencen a sorgir noves idees i puc continuar escrivint amb normalitat. És el mateix amb l'estrès. Penseu en un corrent que continua fluint pel seu camí fins que colpeja una presa de castor, i que la presa bloqueja el flux d'aigua i tot comença a acumular. L'única manera de tornar el flux d'aigua a la normalitat és eliminar la presa. Aquí és on entra en joc l'escriptura. Quan l'escrius, estàs eliminant l'estrès peça per peça fins que puguis tornar a pensar normalment.<br/><br/>L'estrès pot entrar a les nostres vides a través de portes en la nostra vida que mantenim obertes. La procrastinació és una manera que podem deixar les portes obertes per a l'estrès. Esperar fins demà pot ser divertit per avui, però et farà mal demà, i és una solució molt miope. Com més temps esperes per fer alguna cosa, més gran esdevé alguna cosa, i com més gran esdevé, més estrès estaràs convidant a la teva vida. Tenir cura d'alguna cosa tan aviat com la rebem és una gran manera d'evitar l'estrès, però és una cosa que requereix una gran disciplina per fer. Com més es tregui la procrastinació de la seva vida, més lliure d'estrès serà. Tanca la porta i deixa sortir tot l'aire fred.<br/><br/>Així que anem a revisar: Exercici, Escriu el que t'està estressant, i no procrastinar. Aquestes són només algunes maneres d'alleujar l'estrès, però per a mi, són els més eficaços. Tot i que sé que això pot no funcionar per a tothom, m'agradaria convidar a qualsevol persona que se senti estressada a investigar com desfer-se'n. |
