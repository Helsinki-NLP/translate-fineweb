| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

Va ser guardonat amb els "Millor Poeta 2014 i 2021" Premis Hubby.<br/><br/>Madame Monet en un quimono japonès, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domini públic], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Una breu història de la poesia col·laborativa, col·lectiva o en cadena<br/><br/>La poesia col·laborativa, col·lectiva o en cadena és una tècnica alternativa i creativa per escriure poesia per més d'una persona. L'objectiu principal d'aquest tipus de poesia és crear poemes a través de la col·laboració de diversos autors/poetes, tractant de formar una veu unificada mentre encara mantenen les seves veus individuals.<br/><br/>Els exemples de col·laboració abunden en la poesia japonesa. Tot i que els relats i registres precisos de molts d'aquests esdeveniments estan perduts o desapareguts.<br/><br/>Un dels exemples més famosos d'escriptura de poesia col·lectiva va ser la col·lecció de poemes titulada Ralentir Travaux dels poetes surrealistes francesos André Breton, Paul Éluard i René Char. Aquests tres poetes van col·laborar per escriure els poemes en aquesta col·lecció durant només cinc dies el 1930.<br/><br/>Durant la dècada de 1940, Charles Henri Ford, un poeta americà, va inventar el que va anomenar el "poema en cadena", on cada poeta va escriure una línia i després va enviar el poema a una altra persona (per continuar) en una altra part del món, per correu postal.<br/><br/>El 2007 una col·lecció de poesia col·laborativa nord-americana Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry va ser editada i publicada per Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton i David Trinidad.<br/><br/>L'escriptura poètica col·laborativa s'ha utilitzat en escoles i col·legis per ensenyar als estudiants el treball en equip i per descobrir maneres en què estan connectats.<br/><br/>Estudi d'una figura a l'aire lliure: Dona amb un para-sol, mirant cap a l'esquerra, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domini públic o domini públic], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>L'objectiu d'aquest article i com afrontar el repte<br/><br/>Fa uns anys vaig escriure un article anomenat "Poem Without an End" que incloïa un poema de Nadal que havia escrit que es prestava per ser afegit. Em va sorprendre la resposta, ja que en aquella etapa només tenia uns pocs seguidors aquí. La gent va escriure una estrofa de poesia cadascuna en "comentaris" al nucli per seguir de l'estrofa del comentarista anterior. Va funcionar molt bé i al final vaig compilar totes les contribucions en un sol poema com a part del nucli.<br/><br/>Des de llavors s'han emés reptes similars, incloent-hi un de Frank Atanacio anomenat "Spirits Sat as Mourners" que també va tenir molt d'èxit. La diferència és que en aquest cas els col·laboradors van escriure els seus propis nuclis per a la seva estrofa de poesia i van col·locar un enllaç al nucli original de Frank.<br/><br/>Per a aquest repte en particular no espero que tothom passi un temps valuós escrivint centres separats per a una estrofa de poesia (llevat que realment vulguis). El problema principal és que per fer-ho efectiu hauries de copiar les parts anteriorment escrites del poema al teu hub i probablement seria colpejat amb l'etiqueta de "duplicació".<br/><br/>Per tant, que sigui el cas, i també per estalviar haver de deixar enllaços a tot arreu, només demano que qualsevol persona que vulgui participar només escriure la seva estrofa aquí en "comentaris". Comprovar l'últim comentari abans de la seva que està contribuint al repte i seguir endavant. Si veig més d’un seguiment de la mateixa estrofa utilitzaré la meva llicència poètica per treballar-los com crec millor.<br/><br/>En algun moment, quan crec que hi ha hagut prou estrofes afegides, probablement posaré fi al repte i després els compilaré tots junts com el poema completat com a part de l'article (també donant crèdit a cada col·laborador).<br/><br/>Riu amb flors, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domini públic], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>El repte!<br/><br/>I ara arriba la part interessant. Si t’uneixes a aquest repte de poesia en cadena has d’intentar mantenir l’estil i la veu del poema el més a prop possible dels versos anteriors, de manera que als lectors desinformats els sembli que només un autor ha escrit el poema sencer.<br/><br/>Sona fàcil, dius? Bé, potser seria si el poema tingués un estil tradicional, rima o metre. Però aquest no! El poema que afegiràs va ser iniciat per un conegut meu Andriealphus com un "desafiament de poema en cadena" en un altre lloc. En el moment d'escriure jo era l'única altra persona que havia acceptat el repte, i perquè m'agradava el tema vaig pensar que seria un gran repte per als meus companys escriptors i vaig decidir utilitzar-lo aquí i veure si la resposta seria millor. (Conec uns poetes aquí que escriuen d'acord amb aquest estil)<br/><br/>Normes :<br/><br/>Segueix les estrofes anteriors en els comentaris<br/><br/>Intenta mantenir la veu i l'estil del poema<br/><br/>Mantingui la seva estrofa / vers a aproximadament la mateixa longitud que els anteriors<br/><br/>Claude Monet va ser un dels pintors més famosos de la història de l'art i una figura destacada en el moviment impressionista.<br/><br/>El 1883 Monet es va traslladar a Giverny. Aquí, li encantava pintar a l'aire lliure als jardins que va ajudar a crear. Els lliris d'aigua trobats a l'estany tenien un atractiu particular, i va pintar diverses sèries d'ells al llarg de la resta de la seva vida; el pont d'estil japonès sobre l'estany també va ser objecte de diverses obres.<br/><br/>El 1912 Monet va pintar una sèrie de 12 pintures aquàtiques encarregades per l'Orangerie des Tuileries, un museu de París. Va optar per fer-les a gran escala, i per servir com a "refugi de meditació pacífica". Aquest projecte va consumir gran part dels anys posteriors de Monet. Monet va declarar una vegada: "Aquests paisatges d'aigua i reflexió s'han convertit en una obsessió per a mi. Està més enllà de les meves forces com a vell, i no obstant això vull rendir el que sento."<br/><br/>La seva salut era ara un obstacle, també. Gairebé cec, amb els dos ulls greument afectats per cataractes, Monet finalment va acceptar sotmetre's a cirurgia per a la malaltia el 1923.<br/><br/>Els famosos lliris d'aigua de Monet es van tornar més vermells a mesura que avançaven les seves cataractes. Després de rebre una cirurgia correctiva, va destruir la majoria de les pintures del "lliri vermell", enfadat perquè ningú realment li ho va esmentar. Irònicament, aquestes pintures van ser probablement el que va fer el seu estil impressionista tan famós en aquell temps - els artistes van començar a prendre més riscos amb el color i així durant aquest punt.<br/><br/>L'obra mestra<br/><br/>"El noi assegut darrere teu diu que sembles una obra mestra.<br/><br/>Pregunteu-li, ha vist alguna vegada un Monet de prop?<br/><br/>Prou a prop per no veure res més que traces confuses de males herbes a la vora del llac?<br/><br/>Prou a prop per enfonsar els dits a les crestes<br/><br/>on les pintures a l'oli s'endureixen sota la mirada d'un artista?<br/><br/>Prou a prop per respirar sobre els lliris de sang?<br/><br/>Pregunteu-li, per què els va pintar de vermell?" (Andrealphus)<br/><br/>Va somriure com el gat Cheshire de Carroll.<br/><br/>"A través d'ulls ennuvolats i ensangonats m'imagino.<br/><br/>Sigueu els meus aiguamolls!", diu,<br/><br/>"Sentiu la meva respiració i deixeu que els meus dits s'enfonsin,<br/><br/>convertir-se en la meva obra mestra.<br/><br/>Un pinzell mai ha tocat un llenç tan fina com la seva pell clara.<br/><br/>Que els amos plorin de gelosia,<br/><br/>i Van Gogh li talla l'orella en enveja per la bellesa de la teva nuesa" (Jodah)<br/><br/>Autoretrat amb orella embenada<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Domini públic], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Respostes<br/><br/>Ara és el vostre torn.

He estat fent tot el possible per organitzar-los com crec que és millor amb només una mica d'edició. Probablement publicaré el poema acabat com un centre separat amb un enllaç a aquest. El meu llibre està disponible en Lulu i iBooks ... hi ha un enllaç a un dels comentaris anteriors. Realment m'agrairia si hagués de purhase una còpia. Tingueu en compte que és el meu primer llibre electrònic pel que el format, etc no és perfecte, però m'ha portat set revisions crec que per aconseguir-ho on és. Tot serà més fàcil la propera vegada.

Originalment estaven en diferents formats, un ePub, l'altre PDF però ara són tots dos ePub. Estan disponibles a través de Lulu i iBooks, aviat Barnes i Noble i Nook (no Amazon).

Només esperant per veure si hi ha més per afegir. Publicar amb Lulu no era dolent i ara que ho he fet una vegada que serà més fàcil la propera vegada. Aconseguir el format per mirar bé en el llibre electrònic va ser el més difícil, encara que vostè i simplement escriure en un document de paraula i Lulu produeix automàticament la pàgina de continguts i converteix el document a ePub o PDF només pot utilitzar certes fonts i ha d'assegurar-se que els noms dels capítols o títols de poemes estan a la capçalera 1.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | En primer lloc, el mateix EEQT necessita ser desenvolupat per tal de proporcionar una resposta teòrica i computacional a les necessitats de l'enginyeria quàntica moderna i la tecnologia. Hem d'incloure sistemes clàssics amb un nombre infinit de graus de llibertat - com ara camps electromagnètics i / o gravitacionals. També hem d'incloure sistemes quàntics infinits per tal de comprendre i simular el gas de Bose i les seves transicions de fase. Però, també hi ha passos que s’han de prendre molt més enllà del paradigma de l’EEQT.<br/>Com hem subratllat tantes vegades: la teoria quàntica encara no s'ha entès en termes d'una "teoria clàssica no lineal". Però el que entenem per "teoria clàssica" és una cosa molt més avançada i més general que la mecànica clàssica o la teoria de camps clàssica. Per "teoria clàssica" entenem en primer lloc, una teoria que no es basa en probabilitats des del principi; una teoria en la qual les probabilitats apareixen en una etapa posterior, derivada de la teoria; derivada potser, d'una manera necessària. Aquesta teoria no només ha d'especificar els objectes matemàtics i les seves relacions, sinó que també ha de fer "prediccions".<br/>Una teoria clàssica és, en particular, una teoria en la qual poden succeir esdeveniments discrets, esdeveniments que són "objectius". Poden ser esdeveniments que afecten principalment l'estrat físic, però també poden ser "esdeveniments mentals", canvis d'estats de "consciència"; siguin els que siguin, fins i tot si es tracten de ramificacions d'universos, - que ocorren.<br/>Aquesta teoria, que abasta la teoria quàntica tal com la coneixem avui en dia, encara no existeix, però podem preveure la seva possible forma. Res serveix millor que un exemple, així que donem aquí un exemple de com es pot interpretar aquesta teoria.<br/>Imagineu una teoria desenvolupada amb la teoria de camps unificats d'Einstein, però amb una signatura mètrica variable, possiblement amb una xarxa causal complexa, múltiple.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (vegeu també [41]) ponts, bucles de temps, no diferenciabilitat, estructura fractal, tot això addicionalment complicat per la dimensionalitat variable de l'espai i del "temps" (cf [42]. Imagineu una teoria com aquesta que sigui capaç d'acomodar les quatre forces fonamentals que coneixem, però també implica un camp addicional, que és diferent dels camps físics, i que no és local en el sentit que no sobreviu prenent un límit macro-mitjana quan es recupera l'estructura causal de l'espai-temps de la relativitat general d'Einstein. Aquest camp addicional seria un lloc per a "formes de pensament" i la nostra teoria acoblaria aquestes formes de pensament a nivells més "físics" de la realitat. El mateix concepte de<br/>"temps" sorgiria només en una estructura limitant particular. Res impedeix que una teoria d'aquest tipus tingui estructures matemàtiques prou riques per acomodar la consciència i la ment. A causa de la seva complexitat, densitat de bucles de temps, estructura causal semblant a una bombolla, fer prediccions en aquesta teoria només és possible aplicant probabilitat.<br/>com és el cas amb sistemes que evolucionen d'acord amb la dinàmica determinista però caòtica. La funció d'ona quàntica emergiria en una teoria com una manera efectiva de predir. Aquest tipus d'explicació de l'indeterminisme quàntic va ser postulat fa molt de temps per I. J. Good. En<br/>Va especular que l'indeterminisme quàntic es pot entendre si admetem que els esdeveniments quàntics individuals que realment succeeixen aquí i ara tenen causes futures avançades també han passat causes retardades.<br/>Una visió d'aquest pensament pot haver-li ocorregut a Alan Turing quan va escriure la seva famosa frase, ja citada: "la predicció ha de ser lineal, la descripció ha de ser no lineal".<br/>Una teoria que va parcialment en aquesta direcció està sent desenvolupada per L. Nottale.<br/>[43] que afirma l'observació, atribuïda a Feynman, que "els camins típics de les partícules mecàniques quàntiques són continus no diferenciables". El comportament quàntic esdevé, en aquesta teoria, una manifestació de la geometria fractal de l'espai-temps, de la mateixa manera que la gravitació és, en la teoria d'Einstein de la (moció-)relativitat general, una manifestació de la curvatura de l'espai-temps.<br/>Un altre pas en aquesta direcció prové del treball dels científics russos, que van començar amb les idees més originals de N.A. Kozyrev.<br/>i A. Sàkharov [45], i s'està desenvolupant a Moscou, els Urals i Sibèria, vegeu per exemple [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Millor nutrició i exercici per perdre pes<br/><br/>Com és realment saludable l’esmorzar?<br/><br/>Al matí com un emperador, al migdia com un rei, al vespre com un mendig, diu un proverbi ben conegut. Un estudi de l'organització mèdica Endocrine Society confirma el missatge clau darrere de la dita: Mostra que l'esmorzar juga un paper més important del que sovint s'assumeix. Al matí, el cos humà té més del doble d'activitat metabòlica que en altres moments del dia: un gran esmorzar no només el manté ple durant molt de temps, el sucre en la sang i els nivells d'insulina també augmenten lentament. L'apetit per als dolços està regulat, mengem aperitius amb menys freqüència durant el dia. Per tant, l'esmorzar no s'ha de saltar ni tan sols durant una dieta.<br/><br/>Per descomptat, tenir un gran esmorzar no vol dir que hauríem de tenir diversos croissants amb crema de torró de fruits secs i pancakes d'esmorzar dolç al matí. L'esmorzar és saludable millor quan és alt en proteïnes i fibra, així com proporcionar vitamines i minerals. Pa de gra sencer o muesli, flocs de civada, fruites i fruits secs són proveïdors d'energia que són bons per a vostè i mantenir-se ple durant molt de temps.<br/><br/>El fet que un gran esmorzar sigui millor que un gran sopar no vol dir necessàriament que l’esmorzar sigui essencial per perdre pes. Una metaanàlisi realitzada el 2019 va mostrar, que la ingesta diària total d’energia de les persones que esmorzen és de mitjana més alta, que la d’aquells que no ho fan. Aquests últims eren de mitjana poc menys de mig quilo més lleuger. Per tant, d'acord amb els resultats d'aquest gran estudi, no necessàriament ha de menjar l'esmorzar si vol perdre pes.<br/><br/>Perdre pes amb la dieta correcta - que és el fàcil de posar saludable en el seu plat<br/><br/>Menjar saludable de cap manera significa menys sabor. Verdures fresques, peix o carn com a fonts de proteïnes i altres ingredients saludables conjuren gust a l'olla i un somriure als llavis - idealment també quan es trepitja les escales. Un estudi nord-americà ha demostrat que les persones que cuinen els seus propis aliments i tracten conscientment amb el que mengen tenen un índex de massa corporal en el rang normal. Les visites al restaurant o el menjar ràpid, d'altra banda, us atrauen ràpidament a la trampa del sucre: Sovint no hi ha cap indicació de quant sucre hi ha en els amanides, quant de greix es fregeixen les patates o si la carn no s'ha tractat.<br/><br/>Un dinar saludable consta de tres parts - la major part són fruites o verdures i ha de cobrir la meitat del plat. Un quart del menjar ha de consistir en proteïnes, és a dir, peix, carn o tofu. La quarta part restant consisteix en carbohidrats i està idealment feta de productes de cereals integrals. Important: No mengeu a l'escriptori a l'oficina, sinó que estimuleu el metabolisme i, idealment, feu una caminada curta abans o després de dinar.<br/><br/>Quan has de menjar per perdre pes?<br/><br/>A la nit, haureu de centrar-vos en menjars lleugers que són bastant baixos en hidrats de carboni. Aquests són els menys propensos a fer que la insulina s'escalfi, el que és bo per al nostre cos. Les verdures, els productes lactis i els fruits secs, per exemple, són molt adequats per a això.<br/><br/>També ha de tenir cura de no sopar massa tard. És millor haver menjat fins a les 7 p.m. – llavors el cos pot relaxar-se i preparar-se per a la nit. Dormir prou és important per a la pèrdua de pes saludable. Un estudi nord-americà va trobar que les persones que dormien unes vuit hores per nit tenien millors dipòsits de greix. Tan bona nit! Permeteu-vos més de sis hores de son perquè pugui començar el dia següent en forma i refrescat.<br/><br/>Perdre pes sense fer exercici és realment possible?<br/><br/>Seria tan fàcil, si el pes del somni es pogués aconseguir simplement reduint la ingesta de calories. Però probablement coneixeu la saviesa que la dieta és només un costat de la moneda i l'exercici és l'altre. Així que res ajuda: poseu-vos la roba esportiva i aneu!<br/><br/>Qualsevol persona que, a més del programa esportiu com córrer, caminar o nedar, també deixa que l'ascensor vagi sol i prengui les escales, prengui un petit desviament o utilitzi la bicicleta en lloc del cotxe, està fent wellis també anomenat alguna cosa bona. Fins i tot caminar és bo per a la salut. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Per què obrim el servidor d'aplicacions Anvil<br/><br/>Per què Open Source?<br/><br/>Fa poc, vam obrir el Anvil App Server. La reacció de la comunitat ha estat gran, fins i tot una mica aclaparadora (sí, cada resposta a aquest anunci realment va aterrar a la meva safata d'entrada!). Ja hem incorporat un munt d'aquesta retroalimentació en la nostra versió 1.2. Però ens segueixen preguntant, " Per què va open-source una part tan bàsica del seu producte? "<br/><br/>Per què fer això?<br/><br/>Anvil és una eina que fa que sigui el més senzill possible construir una aplicació web. Ho fem permetent construir tota l'aplicació en un llenguatge, Python.<br/><br/>El simple allotjament forma part d’això.<br/><br/>La plataforma web està trencada, i Anvil és el nostre intent de solucionar-ho. I, com que hi ha tanta complexitat en desplegar una aplicació web, un servei allotjat en el núvol era la millor manera de proporcionar la simplicitat que volem. D'aquesta manera, es pot construir la seva aplicació en l'Editor Anvil, i fer-ho viu a Internet amb un clic.<br/><br/>Però seguim sentint a la gent que deia: "Això és genial, però..."<br/><br/>"...però necessito executar això en una plataforma offshore sense accés fiable a Internet"<br/><br/>"...però vull empaquetar la meva aplicació en un dispositiu IoT que venc"<br/><br/>o simplement, "...però si estic posant els meus ous en aquesta cistella, com puc estar segur que encara puc executar la meva aplicació en deu anys?"<br/><br/>Tots aquests són bons punts! Un servei en el núvol no és la solució adequada per a tothom. Si volem servir aquests usuaris, ha d'haver alguna manera per a ells de treure les seves aplicacions d'Anvil i executar-los localment, sota el seu propi control complet.<br/><br/>Font oberta: escotilla d'escapament, no un seient expulsor<br/><br/>Creiem en les escotilles d'escapament, no en els seients expulsors. A les conferències, de vegades ens pregunten, "puc exportar això com una aplicació Flask + JS?". És clar, seria possible: podríem generar un paquet de servidor, compilar el client Python al Javascript i escopir una aplicació web clàssica. Però tindria seriosos inconvenients, perquè:<br/><br/>No és un passeig còmode.<br/><br/>La generació de codi és un seient ejector. El codi generat és millor que res, almenys pots editar-lo! Però en el moment que edites aquest codi, perds tots els beneficis del sistema que el va generar. Si utilitzeu Anvil a causa del seu editor d'arrossega i deixa anar i Python en el navegador, per què els nostres usuaris locals haurien d'utilitzar vim i Javascript?<br/><br/>Així que ho vam fer de la manera correcta: vam obrir el motor d'execució d'Anvil. És el mateix codi que serveix a la teva aplicació en el nostre servei allotjat, i representa la teva aplicació de la mateixa manera. Podeu editar el vostre codi amb un editor de text, executar-lo i després empènyer-lo de nou al nostre IDE en línia. No és un seient expulsor: no hi ha cap transició explosiva. És una escotilla d'escapament: podeu sortir i tornar a pujar.<br/><br/>I el nostre model de negoci?<br/><br/>Anvil mai va ser pensat per ser un d'aquells sistemes d'empresa de baix codi que li cobren $ 20 / mes per cada persona que utilitza la seva aplicació. Anvil és una eina de desenvolupador. Les aplicacions que desenvolupeu són vostres. Permetre-vos executar-los en un Raspberry Pi és genial, però no canvia el nostre model de negoci.<br/><br/>Estem fent el que sempre hem estat: Fem i venem una eina de desenvolupament que fa que sigui dràsticament més senzill construir aplicacions web. Oferim allotjament per a aplicacions Anvil. Oferim tota la plataforma de desenvolupament i allotjament in situ per als clients empresarials. I, per descomptat, oferim un pla gratuït perquè tothom pugui utilitzar Anvil per aficions o propòsits educatius - o per començar a construir alguna cosa i veure com va.<br/><br/>Hem obert el Anvil App Server per al (relativament petit) nombre de persones que ho necessiten, i per proporcionar la política d'assegurança definitiva. Per descomptat, pots construir una aplicació amb vim i allotjar-la tu mateix, sense ni tan sols registrar un compte amb nosaltres (tenim documents per mostrar-te com!). Però l'Editor d'Anvil és la manera més fàcil del món de construir una aplicació web, i el nostre servei allotjat és la manera més fàcil de desplegar-la, de manera que això és el que esperem que la majoria dels nostres usuaris continuïn fent. I pots construir amb confiança, sabent que el codi obert està allà si el necessites.<br/><br/>Prova-ho tu mateix<br/><br/>Si la nostra filosofia de desenvolupament ressona amb vostè, per què no provar Anvil vostè mateix? |
