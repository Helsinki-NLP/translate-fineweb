Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Preguntes Freqüents - FAQ<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" guanya el premi al millor guió<br/><br/>El projecte del blog, "Vida sense papers", creat per Len Grant, presenta històries de famílies migrants indocumentades i joves. Els migrants indocumentats no tenen res. No se'ls permet treballar. No tenen dret a beneficis estatals ni a un lloc on viure. Són invisibles i potencialment el grup més vulnerable del Regne Unit actualment.<br/><br/>Els immigrants indocumentats (o irregulars) inclouen aquells que són tractats en el comerç sexual o per a la servitud domèstica; inclouen visats de sobreestada; aquells les sol·licituds d'asil han estat rebutjades i altres que han estat subjectes a errors en el sistema d'immigració. Totes elles poden haver arribat al Regne Unit legalment.<br/><br/>Els "immigrants il·legals" -els que s'imaginava que havien entrat al país a l'esquena de camions- representen una petita proporció dels indocumentats.<br/><br/>De fet, algunes fonts suggereixen que la meitat dels estimats 120.000 nens indocumentats al Regne Unit en realitat van néixer aquí a pares indocumentats. Aquests nens estan desfavorits des del naixement, únicament pel seu estatus d'immigració.<br/><br/>El blog explica les històries dels indocumentats. Destaca les seves lluites i vulnerabilitats quotidianes, però també la seva força i resiliència. No és una lectura fàcil.<br/><br/>Podeu accedir al blog a través de la nostra pàgina web (a la part inferior de la columna de la dreta a la pàgina principal).<br/><br/>El blog ha guanyat la categoria en línia dels premis dels mitjans de comunicació Speaking Together. Els premis van ser una nova addició aquest any a la celebració dels Premis Dona Migrant i Refugiada de l'Any al Royal Festival Hall de Londres com a part del Dia Internacional de la Dona. El panell de jutges -incloent la novel·lista i dramaturga Gillian Slovo, i la periodista i escriptora Hannah Pool- buscava treballs que desafiessin els mites i els estereotips.<br/><br/>El blog també ha guanyat els Blog North Awards 2013 en la categoria de Millor Escriptura i també ha estat preseleccionat per a un Premi Amnistia Internacional de Mitjans de Comunicació. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Lliçó de l'Escola Sabàtica<br/><br/>En Gàlates, Pau aborda qüestions com la llibertat, el paper de la llei en la salvació, la nostra condició en Crist, i la naturalesa de la vida guiada per l'Esperit, així com l'antiga pregunta: Com poden els humans pecaminosos ser fets justos davant d'un Déu sant i just?<br/><br/>Molts estudiosos creuen que Gàlates pot ser la més antiga de les cartes de Pau. Va ser escrit en el 49 dC, poc després del famós Concili de Jerusalem (Actes 15). Per tant, el llibre pot ser el document cristià més antic conegut. Com ho aclareixen Fets i Gàlates, l'església primitiva es va trobar en una ferotge batalla sobre la naturalesa de la salvació, especialment en el cas dels gentils. Segons un grup de creients jueus, coneguts com a judaitzadors, la creença en Jesús per si sola no era prou bona per als gentils. Els gentils també han de ser circumcidats i seguir les lleis de Moisès (Actes 15:1).<br/><br/>La guia d’estudi bíblic d’aquest trimestre ens convida a viatjar amb l’apòstol Pau mentre prega als Gàlates que es mantinguin fidels a Jesús. També ens dóna l'oportunitat de reflexionar sobre la nostra pròpia comprensió de les veritats que van obrir el camí per a la ruptura definitiva de Martí Luter amb Roma i la restauració de l'evangeli bíblic. |

Tants poetes i artistes van passar el seu temps allà que Hildburghausen va ser sobrenomenat Klein-Weimar, quan l'últim duc de Saxònia-Gotha-Altenburg va morir sense emissió el 1825, les altres branques de la casa van decidir un reordenament dels ducats ernestins. El 12 de novembre de 1826, Frederic es va convertir en duc de Saxònia-Altenburg, a la qual va donar una primera Llei Bàsica l'any 1831, a canvi, dels mitjans relacionats amb Frederic, duc de Saxònia-Altenburg a Wikimedia Commons.<br/><br/>Frederic, duc de Saxònia-Altenburg<br/>--<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15.<br/>Carlota Georgina de Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>--<br/>Charlotte Georgine va néixer a Hannover, Electorat de Brunswick-Lüneburg.

Truchseß va respondre, Vostra Altesa em perdonarà, però mentre aquest castell ha estat aquí, Therese llavors va agafar els barons altre braç, i els tres d'ells van caminar a través de la porta junts.

El 1756, Maria es va traslladar a Dinamarca, per tenir cura dels fills menors de la seva germana, la reina Lluïsa de Dinamarca. Amb ella, va portar els seus fills que van ser criats a la cort al Palau de Christiansborg a Copenhaguen.

És considerat el fundador de la Casa d'Este, havent estat el cap de la primera família a ser mestre d'Este, Alberto Azzo II era l'únic fill d'Albert Azzo I, Margravi de Milà. Va heretar les seves oficines paternes al voltant de 1020, i va augmentar contínuament les seves propietats al nord d'Itàlia, en 1069-1070, va intentar adquirir Maine per al seu fill Hug, perquè la seva esposa, Garsende, era cohereva dels comtes anteriors de Maine. Hug va ser declarat comte, però no va poder prevaler contra Robert, duc de Normandia, en la controvèrsia d'investidura entre Enric IV, emperador del Sacre Imperi Romanogermànic, i el papa Gregori VII, Azzo va intentar mediar, però més tard es va unir al costat del papa. Al voltant de 1073 va fer d'un castell a Este la seva residència, de la qual la Casa d'Este, abans del seu projecte de construcció, Este era poc més que un poble. El seu fill Welf es va traslladar primer a Caríntia i després a Baviera, donant lloc a una de les famílies més importants de la història europea, un altre fill, Fulc I de Milà, va fer el primer ús documentat del títol de Marquès d'Este. Azzo II es va casar amb Kunigunda, la filla de Welf II, comte d'Altdorf i van tenir un fill conegut, Welf Duc de Baviera de 1070 a 1077 i de 1096 a la seva mort que va ser el primer membre de la branca Welf de la Casa d'Este.

Welf es va casar amb Ethelinde de Northeim, filla d'Otó II, duc de Baviera, quan el seu sogre, el duc Otó s'havia convertit en un enemic del rei Enric IV i va perdre el seu ducat, Welf va romandre lleial al rei. En compliment de les ordres d'Enric, va repudiar i divorciar-se de la seva duquessa, Ethelinde, i aquest esdeveniment va tenir lloc a Goslar el 1070, quan els Estats de Baviera es van sotmetre en silenci al nou duc, que era el representant d'una de les famílies més antigues de la província. El seu repudi de la duquessa, que podria haver considerat un acte d'injustícia. Papa i emperador es van reconciliar superficialment el 1076, però l'any els va veure de nou involucrats en hostilitats actives. Enric, com a conseqüència de repetits actes de rebel·lió, va declarar Welf deposat en el seu ducat recentment adquirit. No obstant això, recolzat pels seus fidels bavaresos, i ajudat pel seu pare a Itàlia, Welf va ser capaç de mantenir el seu lloc, però Gregori va morir el 1085 i els seus successors van prendre una part menys intensa en els assumptes d'Alemanya. Welf, tot i que encara s'adheria al partit de l'església, després del divorci, el 1070, de la seva primera esposa, es va casar amb Judit de Flandes, filla de Balduí IV, comte de Flandes, i la vídua de Tostig Godwinson, comte de Northúmbria. El 1089, el fill de Welf, Welf es va casar amb Matilde de Toscana, enfortint així les relacions amb el papa, però, després que el jove Welf es divorciés de Matilde el 1095, Welf es va arreglar amb el rei Enric IV i va ser reconfirmat en la seva posició com a duc de Baviera.

El seu principal èxit va ser evitar un enfrontament entre els seus companys croats, que havien estat saquejant territori bizantí en el seu camí a Constantinoble, el mateix Welf va escapar del fiasco, però va morir en el seu camí de tornada a Pafos, Xipre, el 1101 i va ser enterrat a l'abadia de Weingarten.

Va aspirar a succeir al seu sogre com a duc saxó quan Magnus va morir sense hereus el 1106. No obstant això, el duc Enric va mantenir estretes relacions amb la dinastia saliana, i el 1116 es va unir a l'emperador Enric contra la segona campanya italiana per apoderar-se de les finques de la difunta Margravina Matilde de Toscana. Va succeir al seu germà gran Welf II com a duc de Baviera, quan aquest últim va morir sense fills el 1120, Enric també va ser instrumental en portar a terme el Concordat de Worms de 1122, posant fi a la llarga controvèrsia d'investidura entre el Papa i l'Emperador. El matrimoni es va concloure el maig de 1127, l'alienació entre les dinasties Welf i Hohenstaufen va durar fins al segle XIII.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Segueix-nos<br/><br/>SÓC UN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Desitjant sucre? Aquí és el que el seu cos està tractant de dir-li<br/><br/>Preguntes Freqüents - FAQ<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Augment de pes a partir de desitjos fora de control a part, pot ser frustrant tenir un desig constant per alguna cosa poc saludable i no saber per què. La bona notícia és que normalment hi ha una raó subjacent que el desig ardent d'allotjar una bossa de patates fregides, o la sensació que en realitat podria morir si no té un picada rightthisinstant (encara que no està embarassada). Si vostè està tenint visions de barres de la Via Làctia, per exemple, podria significar que vostè està perdent un nutrient molt específic en la seva dieta. (Sí, és més complicat que la barra de xocolata dita que és tan fotudament deliciós.)<br/><br/>Vam parlar amb la dietista basada a Los Angeles Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., per obtenir la flaca en alguns desitjos comuns d'aliments, així com el que pot fer per saciar la fam sense anar per sobre de la borda. Continuar desplaçant per obtenir una informació seriosament bona!<br/><br/>Si estàs desitjant xocolata<br/><br/>Significa: Vostè podria estar mancant de magnesi en la seva dieta, diu Lenchewski. "El magnesi és un mineral essencial involucrat en la producció d'energia, el metabolisme de la glucosa, i la funció muscular. Això és especialment cert per a aquells colpejant el gimnàs dur", explica. A més, els nivells de magnesi disminueixen durant les setmanes premenstruals del seu període, el que explica per què el síndrome premenstrual sovint ve amb anhels de xocolata.<br/><br/>En el seu lloc, arribar a la xocolata negra d'alta qualitat, baix en sucre, que és naturalment alta en magnesi. "Recomano adherir-se a 75 per cent de cacau o superior, i emparellar-lo amb una altra font rica en magnesi com llavors de gira-sol", diu Lenchewski. Ella suggereix la marca de xocolata Hu, una empresa d'aliments de petit lot que se centra en ingredients d'alta qualitat produïts localment. "És una mica car, però encara més raó per mantenir les porcions sota control", diu. "És el meu favorit personal." També som grans fans de Zenbunni amb superaliments.<br/><br/>Si estàs desitjant caramels<br/><br/>Significa: "El desig de sucre pur és una bona indicació que vostè està tenint poca energia", diu Lenchewski. "Penseu-ho. Què és el que està picor després d'una nit terrible o al voltant de 4 pm durant un dia de treball estressant? La resposta és normalment sucre perquè s'utilitza com a combustible instantani per a les cèl·lules del nostre cos.<br/><br/>En el seu lloc, arribar a les pomes amb mantega de fruits secs. "Si vostè està atacant l'amagatall de caramel dels seus companys de feina, recomanem un carbohidrats més lent cremar amb una font de greix o proteïna", diu Lenchewski. "A diferència del sucre simple, això alimentarà les cèl·lules i evitarà el xoc post-sucre. Dues opcions que fan per a grans pick-me-ups la propera vegada que estàs anhelant caramels: una poma llesca amb la seva elecció de mantega de fruits secs, o baies amb 2% de iogurt grec sense sucre. Ens agrada trencar una dent dolça amb aquestes xips de coco addictius, també - que estan omplint, lliure de qualsevol sucre afegit, i tan bo.<br/><br/>Si tens ganes de sal<br/><br/>Significa: "Si res més que el cogombre més salat farà, és possible que no estigui bevent prou H2O", diu Lenchewski. "La sal ajuda al cos a aferrar-se a l'aigua, així que anhelem quan tenim necessitat de fluids."<br/><br/>En el seu lloc, arribar a l'aigua. "Mantenir-se hidratat, especialment a mesura que ens acostem als mesos d'estiu", diu. La propera vegada que un desig colpeja, tractar d'apagar-lo (literalment) amb unes ulleres refrescants i es pot trobar la urgència de sodi binge desapareix. "Si l'aigua plana us avorreix, proveu d'afegir menta, llimona o fruita congelada per barrejar-la", diu Lenchewski. I si això encara no fa el truc, hi ha una alternativa més saludable a les patates fregides en bosses o patates fregides. "Si vostè està realment només anhelant sal després de tot, algues torrades és una gran opció de baix contingut calòric", diu ella.<br/><br/>Si estàs anhelant carbohidrats amb midó com la pasta<br/><br/>Significa: "Com que els aliments rics en carbohidrats augmenten l'hormona serotonina, els anhels de midó poden ser un signe que necessites un estimulador de l'estat d'ànim", diu Lenchewski.<br/><br/>En el seu lloc, arribar a un bany! "Escapar les sals d'Epsom, perquè és hora d'alguns seriosos R + R," diu Lenchewski. "Confiï en mi. Perdonar-se en un midó lliure per a tots se sent molt bé en el moment, però és probable que et faci més malbé l'endemà." (Com qualsevol que hagi complagut alguna vegada una pizza o pastes desitjos.) Així que la propera vegada que vulgui submergir-se cap primer en un bol de carbohidrats, dibuixar un bany, encendre una espelma, i tractar-se sense cap penediment o calories denses.<br/><br/>Si estàs desitjant gelat<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Significa: "El teu cos pot estar dient que necessita una mica de greix saludable."<br/><br/>"Sóc un realista, així que si vostè està anhelant gelat, no vaig a recomanar un grapat de nous, que, per descomptat, estan plens de greix saludable", diu Lenchewski. "Per a emergències de gelats, recomano gelats de coco amb un contingut baix en sucre com Coconut Bliss o el gelat de tres ingredients de Kippy a Los Angeles." Podem garantir el fet que el gelat de coco té un sabor increïble i igual que el real.<br/><br/>Si estàs desitjant una hamburguesa<br/><br/>Significa: necessiteu ferro. "Si no podeu deixar de pensar en la carn vermella, hi ha una possibilitat que el vostre cos estigui desitjant ferro, b12 i àcid fòlic", diu Lenchewski. "Això és especialment cert durant o al voltant d'aquesta època del mes".<br/><br/>En el seu lloc, arribar a una hamburguesa més saludable. "Sóc un defensor de l'herba alimentat, antibiòtics i carn vermella lliure d'hormones un cop a la setmana", diu Lenchewski. "Intenta experimentar amb una hamburguesa de bisó de cara oberta, que, tallat per tallar, és més prim i té més ferro que la carn de boví ". No mengis carn? Intenta incorporar algun tipus de suplement de ferro a base de plantes a la teva rutina, com l'espirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Serveis web, venedors i lleis cibernètiques!<br/><br/>Actualitzat a:Abril 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>La informatització d'aquest món va canviar l'escenari del rendiment humà en gran mesura i que també més enllà de la mesura. Per exemple, Ara es pot enviar informació vital a tot el món amb un sol clic del ratolí, gràcies a la connectivitat a Internet. Malauradament, és aquesta àmplia connectivitat i popularitat entre la gent, internet també ha augmentat les possibilitats de delictes informàtics. Delictes d'Internet o delictes informàtics són àmpliament coneguts com 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' és una cosa nova en el sistema judicial, però ha guanyat molta atenció últimament. El terme delicte cibernètic és una cosa molt sinònim de delicte convencional, l'única diferència és mitjà d'execució. Hi ha principalment dos tipus de delictes cibernètics, el primer és en el qual els ordinadors són els principals objectius i aquests inclouen casos de danys a les dades, codi maliciós i fins i tot accés criminal a les dades. El segon és en el qual l'ordinador és només una eina que utilitza delictes convencionals es cometen per exemple el terrorisme cibernètic, spamming, cyber stalking i molts més.<br/><br/>Aquí és on un consultor de lloc web o un proveïdor entra en escena. Encara que no és conscient de totes les lleis cibernètiques presents fins a la data, un proveïdor de lloc web pot assessorar sobre algunes de les lleis cibernètiques més vitals mentre crea el seu lloc.<br/><br/>Això pot incloure el coneixement comú dels drets de còpia o fins i tot protegir el contingut del seu propi lloc web. Explicar-li tots els drets que posseeix com a propietari del lloc web també és una de les tasques que un proveïdor de llocs web pot fer mentre desenvolupa el seu lloc web. Un proveïdor també pot ajudar a oferir-li informació sobre diferents lleis cibernètiques per protegir les dades. A més de tot això, un proveïdor també pot oferir-li informació sobre qualsevol nova llei cibernètica que pot no ser conscient de fins que sàpiga. Les lleis cibernètiques poden variar d'un país a un altre, un exemple recent pot ser la llei de cookies alliberada al Regne Unit, que impedeix que el lloc web desi dades de navegació de l'usuari. Segons la Llei de cookies, els llocs web al Regne Unit no poden guardar arxius de cookies sense el consentiment informatiu del navegant.<br/><br/>És després de l'aplicació d'aquesta llei, els llocs web ara tenen una finestra emergent, que sol·licita el consentiment del visitant per guardar arxius de cookies. Aquests arxius són utilitzats pels llocs web per analitzar el patró de navegació dels visitants en funció de quins anuncis es publiquen en una finestra d'usuari. Amb la pirateria informàtica ja no és una cosa nova per a tots nosaltres, creus que aquestes regles i regulacions poden prevenir la falsificació en línia o el delicte cibernètic? La tecnologia s'ha desenvolupat a un ritme ràpid, però encara la gent no prefereix comprar en línia a causa de la por de les dades personals o bancàries de ser piratejat. Amb l'augment de la delinqüència cibernètica, la necessitat de lleis cibernètiques estrictes també han augmentat per frenar el mateix i per promoure una experiència de compra lliure de risc.<br/><br/>Classes de delictes cibernètics<br/><br/>Al llarg dels anys s'han produït tres grans tipus de delictes cibernètics:<br/><br/>Accés no autoritzat de casos de sistemes informàtics, que implica piratejar o robar noms d'usuari i contrasenyes per obtenir accés a la informació personal de l'usuari respectiu. Aquest tipus d'accés per backdoor s'organitzen amb l'ajuda de Cavall de Troia. Alliberar programes maliciosos com Trojan House, cucs o virus informàtics, etc. L'última classe inclou l'assetjament cibernètic a un usuari o l'assetjament en línia.<br/><br/>Implicacions directes dels delictes cibernètics<br/><br/>Disminució de les vendes<br/><br/>Disminució de la producció de personal a causa dels retards de la xarxa<br/><br/>Pèrdua d'informació personalitzada com el treball d'investigació<br/><br/>Disrupció en el procés de comunicació<br/><br/>Implicacions indirectes dels delictes cibernètics<br/><br/>Qüestió de credibilitat en el nostre sistema financer<br/><br/>La imatge de marca es manxa al mercat<br/><br/>Els delictes cibernètics afecten les relacions comercials al mercat<br/><br/>Es perd el sentit de la confiança en les polítiques estatals i les agències governamentals<br/><br/>Prevenció del delicte cibernètic<br/><br/>Com a internautes hi ha certes precaucions que hauríem de tenir en compte per a una experiència en línia segura i segura. Aquí en teniu algunes:<br/><br/>El primer que has de fer és mantenir la informació personal per a tu mateix i evitar compartir la mateixa en línia.<br/><br/>Evitar compartir fotografies amb amics de xat en línia o estranys.<br/><br/>Instal·lar l'última versió de l'antivirus en el seu sistema pot oferir-li una bona línia de defensa contra les amenaces d'Internet com virus i malware.<br/><br/>Mantenir una còpia de seguretat de les seves dades valuoses és una bona opció per evitar problemes com la contaminació per virus.<br/><br/>Evitar l'enviament d'informació de targetes de crèdit a llocs que no estan segurs i no tenen cap certificat vàlid.<br/><br/>Instal·lar un programa de seguretat que li ofereix control sobre les galetes del lloc i li estalvia ser rastrejat per llocs web.<br/><br/>Posar dispositius de detecció d'intrusions basats en l'amfitrió als servidors l'ajudarà a fer un seguiment de les irregularitats en el trànsit del seu lloc web.<br/><br/>S'aconsella l'ús del firewall.<br/><br/>Per què els ciberatacs són tan populars?<br/><br/>Més barat que els mètodes tradicionals d'engany<br/><br/>Seguiment de delictes cibernètics no és fàcil<br/><br/>Les ubicacions exactes no es poden rastrejar fàcilment<br/><br/>Absència de barreres físiques al món d’Internet<br/><br/>Els delictes cibernètics afecten un gran nombre de persones<br/><br/>Conclusió<br/><br/>El fet que la ment humana tingui un poder insondable és innegable, i és per això que els delictes a Internet estan augmentant a un ritme enorme. Fins i tot la història ha estat testimoni d'algunes de les majors seguretats d'Internet que han caigut per les mans dels pirates informàtics, que també s'han escapat fàcilment. L'única manera de frenar aquest delicte és mantenir-se conscient de les lleis cibernètiques que tenim avui, que poden ser a través d'Internet o a través de proveïdors de llocs web / TI. La Llei de Tecnologia de la Informació ha de ser equilibrada de tal manera que resulti massa estricta per a les persones que estan involucrades en delictes cibernètics i, al mateix temps, mai hauria d'impedir el creixement de la indústria d'Internet.<br/><br/>Autor Bio:– Maneet Puri actualment dirigeix una empresa de disseny web de qualitat situada a Nova Delhi, Índia.
