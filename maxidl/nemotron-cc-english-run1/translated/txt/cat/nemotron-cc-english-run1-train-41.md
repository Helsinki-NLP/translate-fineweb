| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 de nov. de 2015<br/>Publicat per Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa és una planta perenne que prospera a les regions subtropicals i tropicals pantanoses de tot el món. L'herba molt apreciada és un ingredient clau en Doxiderol, un suplement nutricional que millora la funció cognitiva. La Bacopa va ser escollida per la seva capacitat de protegir el cervell i augmentar l'acetilcolina, un missatger bioquímic que permet al sistema nerviós retransmetre informació.<br/><br/>Els practicants ayurvèdics van descriure per primera vegada les propietats terapèutiques de la bacopa el 300 aC. Els metges van registrar les habilitats de la bacopa per millorar la intel·ligència i la memòria. Gairebé 2.500 anys després, un cos creixent de recerca moderna confirma els beneficis cognitius de la bacopa registrats en el text ayurvèdic.<br/><br/>El 1987, els investigadors de l'Índia van avaluar els efectes de la bacopa en la funció intel·lectual dels nens en edat escolar. Durant l'estudi de quatre setmanes, van administrar bacopa a 40 nens de 6 a 8 anys. Els científics van determinar que la bacopa va augmentar la percepció i la memòria. Els nens van ser capaços de resoldre exercicis de laberint més ràpid i amb més precisió després de rebre bacopa. Molts pares a l'Índia utilitzen habitualment bacopa per millorar el desenvolupament intel·lectual dels seus fills.<br/><br/>Un estudi de 12 setmanes publicat en el número d'agost de 2001 de Psychopharmacology va investigar els efectes de la bacopa en la funció cognitiva. Els científics van assignar aleatòriament als voluntaris sans, d'edat 18 a 65, per rebre bacopa o una substància inactiva. També van utilitzar una configuració doble cec per a l'estudi per ocultar les identitats dels productes. Els investigadors utilitzen aquest disseny per assegurar que els resultats de les proves són vàlids perquè elimina el biaix per part dels investigadors i els participants. El grup de bacopa va experimentar una millora significativa en la velocitat a la qual van poder processar la informació visual. Els participants també van aprendre més ràpid i van emmagatzemar nous records de manera més eficient.<br/><br/>El 2007, un estudi de laboratori del Texas A&M College of Medicine va revelar un dels mecanismes responsables de la capacitat de la bacopa per promoure la salut cerebral. Segons els científics, la bacopa utilitza polifenols per prevenir l'estrès oxidatiu i el dany que causa a les cèl·lules cerebrals sanes. La bacopa també redueix els dipòsits nocius d'una substància coneguda com a beta-amiloide, que és el component primari de la placa en el cervell dels pacients amb malaltia d'Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Un estudi doble cec publicat al número de juliol de 2008 del Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine va avaluar l'efecte de la bacopa en pacients d'edat avançada. L'estudi va confirmar que la bacopa va augmentar el rendiment cognitiu mentre reduïa l'estrès. Segons els autors, els beneficis aconseguits en aquest estudi van confirmar els resultats d'investigacions anteriors.<br/><br/>Un estudi de 90 dies publicat al número de desembre de 2008 de Phytotherapy Research confirma els beneficis cognitius que es van demostrar anteriorment en altres estudis de bacopa. Bacopa va millorar significativament la capacitat dels participants per emmagatzemar temporalment i utilitzar la informació necessària per completar una tasca complexa. L'estudi doble cec també va demostrar que la bacopa va reduir el temps necessari per processar la informació visual.<br/><br/>A més de millorar la transmissió del senyal nerviós, els científics teoritzen que la bacopa augmenta la funció cognitiva reduint l'ansietat. Nombrosos estudis indiquen que l'ansietat interfereix amb la capacitat de realitzar tasques que requereixen funcions cognitives de nivell superior, com l'aprenentatge i la memorització. L'estrès interromp els missatgers bioquímics i la transmissió de senyals nerviosos saludables. Bacopa alleuja l'estrès i restaura una sensació de calma mitjançant l'augment dels nivells d'acetilcolina, que redueix la freqüència cardíaca i li permet prendre respiracions més profundes.<br/><br/>Doxiderol és una gran manera d'obtenir els beneficis de la bacopa. Aquest suplement holístic també conté altres ingredients naturals que promouen la salut del cervell i donen suport a la seva capacitat de centrar-se i concentrar-se en tasques complexes, així com memoritzar informació. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

També pot sentir aures demoníaques, així com aures malignes. Quan va néixer i va créixer, però, els seus poders van ser segellats i ella era molt menys poderosa. Des de la derrota de la que segellava els seus poders, Kagome ha arribat al seu màxim potencial.<br/><br/>PURIFICACIÓ En fer una connexió física, Kagome té la capacitat de purificar tant el verí com la foscor d'un subjecte (vivent i inanimat). Per fer-ho, projecta els seus poders espirituals a través de la seva mà.<br/><br/>BARRERES ESPIRITUALS Amb tot el seu potencial, Kagome té la capacitat de crear una barrera al seu voltant i expandir-la al voltant dels altres. És una barrera en forma de cúpula que pot destruir els dèbils dimonis que fan contacte amb la barrera.<br/><br/>VISIÓ MILLORADA<br/>Kagome té la capacitat de veure coses que sovint són invisibles a l'ull humà: fantasmes, esperits, aures divines i malignes.<br/><br/>HABILITATS AMB ARMES<br/>Kagome té la capacitat d'utilitzar un arc i una fletxa. Ha estat auto-entrenada, i després d'anys de pràctica, la seva fletxa rarament perd la seva marca. Al costat d'això, Kagome té la capacitat d'infundir les seves fletxes amb poders. Ella pot infundir una fletxes amb els seus poders espirituals que els permet penetrar forces demoníaques, destruir encanteris, i purificar objectes. Ella pot infundir el seu arc amb els seus poders i desviar atacs enemics. Té la capacitat d'infundir les seves fletxes amb energia purificadora per purificar el verí, així com poderosos atacs demoníacs de llarga distància. I, finalment, té l'habilitat de saltar-se els altres amb la seva fletxa: si el seu objectiu passa a estar darrere d'una barrera o un ostatge, la fletxa pot teletransportar-se i colpejar només el seu objectiu.<br/><br/>La resta de les seves habilitats s'han tornat bastant insignificants, ja que estan relacionades amb el viatge en el temps (a través del pou del menjador d'ossos), la joia de Shikon, o la seva encarnació anterior.<br/><br/>el cànon<br/><br/>Kagome ha estat retirat uns dies després de la seva graduació de l'escola secundària, però, abans que el pou del menjador d'ossos s'hagi obert de nou per permetre-li tornar al passat permanentment.<br/><br/>lliurament<br/><br/>Memòries<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>El so del seu nom era un suau xiuxiueig al darrere de la seva ment, com una trucada amordaçada pel vent. Era el so d'un record llunyà, una veu que havia començat a oblidar però desesperadament s'aferrava a tot el mateix. Era la veu de la seva mare, retorçada pel dolor de la seva filla perduda. Després, Kagome va desterrar sense deixar rastre. Va recordar vívidament aquells moments, la manera en què el dia havia començat, el que havia menjat per esmorzar i l'última cosa que havia dit a la seva mare. Era obsessiu, aquells records, perquè era com qualsevol altre moment que havia lliscat entre mons. S'havia despertat, sense afanys, perquè no tenia cap propòsit fora de l'escola. Ella podia trobar una feina, i estava programada per a una entrevista aquell dia. El seu cor no hi havia estat, però era el que havia de fer.<br/><br/>Va recordar la sensació de por, succionant-ho i donant-se una xerrada de pep que ella podia fer això. Que ella podria progressar en la vida que estava destinat a ara que les coses s'havien assentat en el passat. Per descomptat, tenia la sensació persistent que ja no pertanyia al seu propi temps o a la seva pròpia vida. No amb tot el que havia deixat enrere.<br/><br/>Kagome va recordar la sensació de la fusta sota els seus dits, la manera en què la seva mà s'havia encreuat a la mà per lliscar la porta oberta. Ella va recordar que es va aturar, girant-se cap a la seva mare amb un somriure brillant i vibrant com ella es va sacsejar de la seva estupor. "M'estic enlairant." Va recordar el fort que sonava la seva veu, el somriure en els llavis de la seva mare com els seus ulls brillaven amb orgull. La seva mare li va dir adéu, cosa que no semblava diferent d'abans, però d'alguna manera el pes de les paraules es va assentar més pesat sobre les espatlles de Kagome com més reflexionava.<br/><br/>Breument, els pensaments parpellejaven cap endavant, preguntant-se si la seva mare es preocupava per ella, la va trobar a faltar com ho va fer. Kagome podia admetre obertament que la força de la seva mare, el seu suport al fet que la seva filla lliscava a través del temps amb tanta freqüència. Hi havia moments en què es pensava feble per no tenir la dona per recolzar-se.<br/><br/>No obstant això, va recordar que va reunir una petita quantitat de força. Podria recordar el canvi en l'aire, la temperatura notablement diferent del que havia esperat, parpellejant en l'entorn sobtat i desconegut. No era el santuari de la seva família. I quan es va girar per tornar enrere, per lliscar per la porta que havia entrat, es va trobar amb metall desconegut i fred sota la punta dels seus dits i un interior que no era l'entrada de casa seva. Un home es va posar davant d'ella, darrere d'un taulell, que la mirava amb ulls tan amplis com els seus.<br/><br/>Almenys no va entrar en pànic. Al ser esquinçada a través del temps i col·locada en situacions impossibles, almenys va construir la seva força de voluntat pel que fa a esdeveniments estranys va anar. Perquè no era cada dia que algú es trobava arrossegat al passat per un dimoni, amb la intenció d'arrencar una poderosa joia del seu cos que ni tan sols sabien que hi era. I després hi havia el fet que ella havia trencat dit potent joia en qui sap quantes peces i va ser encarregat de trobar-los. Aquestes coses no eren normals, i ella havia necessitat de quadrat i rodar amb ella una vegada que es va adonar que era la seva realitat. Havia semblat tan simple, només recollir els trossos i arreglar la joia.<br/><br/>Però no havia estat fàcil, hi havia molts dimonis després dels trossos i la joia mateixa. I un dimoni particularment poderós amb un desig que estava decidit a veure complit. Fins al dia d'avui, ella mai havia après el seu desig, però sabia que mai s'havia concedit ni tan sols una vegada que havia acabat la cosa explosió. Havia arruïnat tantes vides per no res. Va arruïnar tantes vides per a una tasca tan inútil. Naraku havia estat l'enemic més difícil, i el que havia estat el centre de tot el que havia sortit malament en totes les vides de la seva amiga.<br/><br/>Però va ser aquesta impredictibilitat, aquesta necessitat de rodar amb el que estava succeint i la força de voluntat que havia obtingut de la seva aventura que va recordar inspirar-se en una història que encaixava en el moment que no semblava massa capritxosa o llunyana. S’havia de creure, havia de sobreviure.<br/><br/>Després de tot, es va enfrontar pitjor que un home en una botiga de càmeres. Ella havia mentit a través de les dents per salvar la seva vida abans.<br/><br/>"Estava buscant feina." Al final, no era una mentida completa. Després de tot, ella havia marxat de casa seva amb la intenció d'assistir a una entrevista de treball. El seu estat de vestir almenys donaria testimoni d'això. Va ser una de les fibs més fàcils que havia dit mai.<br/><br/>I, per alguna raó, aquell boig la va contractar.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed es va girar en el seu llit com ella va empènyer enrere els records llunyans, negant-se a reconèixer que estava realment despert. Ella es va arrissar en els últims cops de son, suplicant-li que tornés i per portar-la de nou a la seva abraçada. Va tancar els ulls, disposada a dormir per venir i només es va trobar amb records. Els ecos d'una cançó cantada en la distància dels seus records, una cançó que sovint l'havia turmentat, donat el mateix nom que ella. La veu que cantava ja no recordava a la seva mare, sinó a les veus dels nens amb els quals sovint havia jugat creixent. Van tornar a cridar els records, tot i que havien passat anys des que ella va començar aquest en viu, tot i que ella era feliç en aquesta vida, la crida d'aquests records era massa forta.<br/><br/>De sobte, ella estava tornant a caure en ells i el son la va evadir de nou. Ella estava mirant-se a si mateixa en l'abraçada de la seva família mentre Inuyasha va ser tirat de nou en el pou, mirant tan sorprès com ella havia sentit. Els records d’aquell moment, aquells sentiments, eren encara tan forts. La sensació de dolor i desgràcia va tornar a florir encara que feia tant de temps que havia sentit com si hagués estat arrencada de tot el que li importava.<br/><br/>Per descomptat, la seva família importava, i ella estava feliç d'estar en els seus braços de nou. Mai va poder descriure completament, realment com havia sentit en aquells dies. Encara no podia explicar la manera en què se sentia dividida en dos, amb desitjos guerrers per estar tant en el seu passat com en el present. Va recordar els intents inútils de saltar a través del pou, els dits que grataven a terra en una súplica desesperada per deixar-la tornar. El primer mes a casa, no dormia tant com plorava.<br/><br/>Elysion havia guarnit una reacció similar, encara que no era tan ferotge perquè no sabia exactament on havia lliscat per ni on podria cuc el seu camí de tornada. Les seves exploracions van ser subtils entre treballar la seva feina i tractar d'instal·lar-se en aquesta vida. Ella no tenia intencions de quedar-se, no intencions de romandre més temps del que necessitava. I tot i que no ho va intentar tan ferotgement com ho havia intentat quan va intentar tornar al passat, la seva passió era deu vegades més gran perquè no tenia vincles amb aquest món. Perquè estava realment sola... sense esperança de que ningú pogués arribar a ella.<br/><br/>En els seus moments irracionals, va pensar que la Joia l'havia tirat d'esquena i va trobar un nou infern on residir. Un nou infern que l'obligaria a fer un desig, però va recordar molt clarament que ella havia desitjat que s'hagués anat per sempre. Això no va aturar els seus somnis, els moments en què es desperta a la nit plorant. I aquells records del seu passat eren els més difícils de tractar, els més difícils d'oblidar. El seu cor va començar a córrer en pànic quan es va girar al seu llit de nou, la seva respiració es va convertir en una lluita mentre lluitava contra un atac de pànic induït per la seva ment errant a aquesta hora de la nit.<br/><br/>Odiava sentir-se tan feble, tan espantada.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finalment es va treure del llit, la seva habitació il·luminada amb una llum pàl·lida que era suficient per guiar-la al bany. Ella es va parar davant del mirall, el lavabo corrent mentre mirava el seu reflex. El cabell de color corb cobria la seva cara i se sentia tan malament com es veia. El seu primer matí a Elysion era similar a això, només que ella estava en pitjor forma.<br/><br/>Havia trobat un lloc per dormir, aconseguint arribar a un acord amb el propietari de l'edifici per permetre-li romandre un petit període de temps sense pagar. Potser va ser la influència de Miroku la que li va permetre fer aquests acords, ja que el monjo era conegut pel seu camí en la gent encantadora (o enganyosa) en donar-los més que suficient per al treball que havien fet. El monjo sempre havia estat així, des que s'havien conegut per primera vegada. Reclamaria l'habitatge d'un senyor per ser embruixat quan no ho era o, afirmen que estaven subjectes a un atac quan no ho serien. Ell vendria els seus barris i encants per preus tan alts. Va funcionar pràcticament cada vegada i es preguntava per què la gent havia estat tan disposada a confiar en ell.<br/><br/>Potser era el seu somriure, o el fet que era un monjo que la gent del passat estaven tan disposats a esfondrar. Mai va depredar als febles, almenys. Sempre feia el que era correcte i era un símbol de força per a ella en moments en què ho empenyia tot per fer el que era correcte. Va empènyer a través del fet que estava morint, que estava maleït, i va tractar de fer alguna cosa al respecte en lloc d'arrossegar-se en el seu destí. S'havia empès al límit en el temps que conduïa a la seva lluita final. I ella s'havia alegrat que haguessin derrotat en Naraku abans que ell pogués ser sotmès al mateix destí que el seu pare, i el seu pare abans que ell.<br/><br/>Pel que fa als seus propis encants, però, ella era més justa que la seva amiga i va fer el tracte raonable. Ella dubtava que qualsevol en aquest món pagaria un alt preu per un exorcisme o desterrar dimonis. Estaven massa avançats tecnològicament per a això. Però era prou intel·ligent, i prou intel·ligent, per fer un bon negoci.<br/><br/>Però ara, Kagome estava en un lloc millor encara que l'aspecte de la seva cara semblava el mateix. Embruixat, cansat, drenat ...<br/><br/>Una mirada ràpida a un rellotge a la paret li va dir que podria tractar de dormir més. Però ella va optar per fora d'això, no volent enfrontar els flashbacks de nou. Va prendre una dutxa en el seu lloc, utilitzant l'aigua freda per allunyar els seus dimonis, per omplir els seus pulmons amb una forta ingesta d'aire i forçar-se a despertar.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>No ha funcionat.<br/><br/>No de la manera que estava desitjant. L'aigua freda certament va forçar l'aire en els seus pulmons, va obligar la seva ment a despertar i els músculs a agafar. Un riure amarg es va treure dels seus llavis com ella va inclinar el cap cap enrere i es va trobar recordant més. Avui, ella no anava a escapar d'ells tan fàcilment. No anava a recuperar-se tan senzillament, per recuperar-se només perquè ho volia.<br/><br/>De vegades, no pots evitar els pensaments que vols, fins i tot quan estàs segur que els has superat.<br/><br/>Sango hauria estat una gran ajuda en aquesta situació. L'assassina del dimoni era el seu millor amic, fins i tot anava fins i tot a anomenar-la la germana que mai va tenir. Una germana gran que era sàvia, sempre tenia el seu costat quan els problemes sorgeixen. Particularment noi problema, quan aquestes coses eren bastant trivial, però era divertit per tenir un atractiu i per al seu amic per estar boig en el seu nom quan Inuyasha la va fer trista. Després de tot, havia estat sovint que el mig dimoni corria al costat del seu amant mort i trencar el seu cor més d'una vegada.<br/><br/>Però, Sango també l'ha inspirat d'altres maneres. Després de tot el que la dona s'havia enfrontat, sempre havia estat tan forta, tan segura... Fins i tot en els moments en què s'havia dubtat a si mateixa, sempre s'havia atrevit. Va admirar que tenia la capacitat de sobreviure després de perdre tota la seva família - el recordatori d'això sovint va empènyer a Kagome a sobreviure, perquè ella va perdre a tothom en aquest món - i després tenir el seu germà es va convertir en un peó de Naraku. No va ser fàcil, no podia haver estat una cosa a la qual qualsevol pogués enfrontar-se i encara seguir endavant. Encara somriu, fins i tot amb aquell dolor i aquells recordatoris... Sovint era tan brillant, fins i tot en els temps més foscos.<br/><br/>I en aquest moment, ella volia recolzar-se en el costat de la dona més gran, per reconfortar-se en el fet que ella era allà i ella era de suport. Ella sentia que Sango d'alguna manera tirar a través d'això, i oferir algunes paraules de força i comprensió. Van ser moments com aquests que van empitjorar aquests encanteris, el recordatori constant que ella estava sense la seva família.<br/><br/>"No vull estar sola." Va cridar en veu alta en la seva solitud, el so de la dutxa ofegar la súplica.<br/><br/>No tenia por d'admetre-ho.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Una altra hora havia passat abans que ella s'havia adonat. La seva pell estava freda de l'aigua i se sentia com gel corrent a través de les seves venes. Ella no s'havia adonat que havia començat a tremolar fins que la mà va arribar a apagar l'aigua i acabar la seva dutxa. Kagome no va tornar a mirar-se al mirall, sinó que es va embolicar en tovalloles i va sortir del bany, va pujar les escales i va entrar a la cuina. Va començar a fer un esmorzar lleuger, llegint ociosament les seves notes del dia mentre cuinava el menjar.<br/><br/>La seva carrera va anar realment despegant aquests últims anys. Les seves fotos van aparèixer en moltes galeries, el seu nom va començar a freqüentar molts llavis per a aquells que estaven interessats en la fotografia.<br/><br/>El treball que havia sol·licitat en un caprici havia provocat tot. Ella havia estat molt més afortunada del que havia esperat ser en aquest món. Mai la sort de lliscar de nou a través de les esquerdes en el seu propi món, però la sort de fer-ho bé. Quan va tornar a la estufa, va recordar el temps que finalment havia renunciat a tornar a casa. Va ser al voltant de dos anys en la seva vida aquí, ja que havia començat a aventurar-se en la fotografia com més que un hobby, però alguna cosa que podia fer-se un nom per si mateixa amb.<br/><br/>Aquell dia havia estat particularment agradable, el sol era alt en el cel i ella s'havia trobat fent algunes fotos del paisatge natural. Un nen s'havia amagat en una de les plantes, i ella havia capturat una imatge del moment en què la seva cara s'havia instal·lat en un somriure alegre i traïdor el moment abans d'haver saltat per espantar la seva presa. Li recordava Shippou, el petit kitsune que havia adoptat, essencialment. Ell, també, havia estat tret de la seva família quan es van conèixer per primera vegada. El seu pare va matar i ell estava decidit a venjar-lo. Quan era jove, semblava molt madur en les seves primeres trobades.<br/><br/>Potser va ser la influència de l'Inuyasha el que va permetre que el kit tornés a actuar com un nen, a ser jove i capritxós a vegades mentre que altres eren més madurs. Li va oferir consol a la seva manera, i ella va tractar de tenir cura d'ell com si fos la seva, encara que ella havia estat tan jove llavors també. No obstant això, la seva joventut no la va impedir d'entendre com tenir cura d'ell o tenir cura d'ell com el seu fill. El seu cor es va inflar quan va somriure, quan havia estat tan feliç pel seu regal de llapis i es va prendre el temps per fer art. Ella estava tan orgullosa de cada dibuix que havia acabat que sabia que així era com una mare se sentiria en una situació així.<br/><br/>El dolor que li havia esquinçat era massa, massa sobtat. El va trobar a faltar i volia veure quant havia crescut des que havia marxat. Havia trobat a faltar tant...<br/><br/>Per estalviar-se més dolor, més falses esperances, es va rendir i es va centrar en millorar-se.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>L'esmorzar tenia un gust suau, avorrit i inspirat. Només després d'haver acabat es va adonar que s'havia oblidat de qualsevol tipus d'espècies o sabor al menjar. Era massa tard ara per recordar-ho, ja que la seva ment estava massa ocupada a recordar altres detalls de la seva vida que clarament s'havien convertit en més important que el seu menjar.<br/><br/>"Asseu-te!"<br/><br/>Per descomptat, no va passar res quan ella havia cridat amb ira a un client particularment frustrant que li recordava el mig dimoni. Ell estava sent particularment obstinat i maleducat, volent una foto presa el seu camí en lloc de deixar que funcioni de forma natural. Vostè podria tractar de forçar als animals salvatges a comportar-se com vostè volia. Però, rarament ningú va tenir èxit amb la força. Inuyasha no era tan dolent, però. Inuyasha havia après abans que ella havia estat forçat a allunyar-se d'ell. S'havia tornat més suau, més comprensiu, més madur encara que hi havia vegades que encara era infantil i arrogant.<br/><br/>Ella recorda com de vermelles s'havien cremat les galtes, però com es va aturar i el va acomiadar. Li va dir que es negava a treballar per a ningú o amb algú que volia torçar alguna cosa més enllà de la seva naturalesa, més enllà dels seus propis desitjos.<br/><br/>Hauria d'haver comparat l'home amb Naraku en lloc d'Inuyasha. Encara que el seu client no tenia intencions tan extremes. Almenys el sentiment després va ser un record agradable. La llibertat de saber que havia arribat tan lluny que podia rebutjar una feina que no volia fer, ser la seva pròpia persona que era independent dels altres. Ella podia dir que ho va fer en aquell moment. Tot i que va sentir rumors dies després amb paraules destinades a calumniar-la.<br/><br/>Es va defensar justament, com ho va fer cap al final del seu viatge. Després de tot, ella era l'única que podia protegir-se en aquest món.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>La llum del matí va començar a arrossegar-se a casa seva, recordant-li de nou el pas del temps. De nou, va considerar la llista de coses que havia de fer i va debatre per on començar. O, si hagués de començar en absolut. Amb com va començar el dia, ella no sabia si podia considerar que una gran idea. Era dubtós que ella tindria èxit amb el perdut en si mateixa que s'estava convertint.<br/><br/>Ella no volia arruïnar el seu últim treball. Perquè ho havia fet en unes poques ocasions abans. No era agradable tractar de recuperar-se d'un desastre complet.<br/><br/>Kagome va recordar la sensació de la seva càmera cara, nova, que es va deslligar de les seves mans. Ella no estava preparada per donar-li suport, perquè ella acabava de treure de la seva bossa. Part d'ella cridava a l'interior. Una dramàtica, exagerada, plena de crits que feia amb freqüència quan era molt, molt més jove. Quan estava lluitant per superar l'escola secundària mentre saltava entre els moments. L'altra part d'ella s'havia quedat congelada al seu lloc mentre la seva lent es trencava completament i la resta de la càmera s'havia trencat amb ella.<br/><br/>Veient el germà d'Inuyasha, un dimoni ple, de peu davant d'ella era l'última cosa que esperava quan havia fet el seu camí per les seves fotos. Es va mantenir tan orgullós com mai, tan alt com mai, tan imponent com ella recordava. No semblava enlluernat en absolut per estar en un món completament diferent, encara que ella mai va ser el millor en la lectura de la seva ment. El seu nom en els seus llavis era tan potent, que podia recordar els sentiments més petits com ho feia. Els seus llavis estaven esgarrapats, la seva boca se sentia seca, i la sensació d'ansietat en el seu estómac la feia sentir malalta.<br/><br/>No volia que les seves esperances s'aixequessin.<br/><br/>Però ella volia que estigués allà, fins i tot si no eren amics. Eren aliats, si és que alguna cosa, ja que havien lluitat un al costat de l'altre. I alguna cosa era millor que absolutament res.<br/><br/>I Kagome tenia el sentit suficient per no llançar-se a ell, per embolicar els seus braços al voltant d'ell en alleujament que sabent que ella no estava sola. La seva càmera ja no importava quan es va acostar a ell. Va recordar que res més importava durant dies mentre passava temps amb ell, no parlant del seu món sinó parlant (o, ella estava parlant i ell simplement va reconèixer aquest fet).<br/><br/>Quan, exactament, ella es va enamorar d'ell però... Kagome no podia recordar. Era una cosa subtil, igual que ell. Però ella sabia que la sensació era allà. I ell li va fer saber que ella no estava sola en el fet que havia caigut, que els sentiments havien florit d'alguna manera.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Una sensació d'ingravidesa la va superar i, de sobte, els seus ulls es van obrir mentre la seva ment s'arriava desesperadament per l'última cosa que estava fent. No recordava quan s'havia adormit en el seu sofà, però sabia que l'últim lloc que havia estat era en els coixins massa còmodes. Ella no va lluitar, però, o lluitar contra la ingravidesa com ella estava en braços familiars. El seu cap es va inclinar contra el pit de Sesshoumaru, confortant-se en el fet que ell era aquí i ella no estava sola.<br/><br/>"Benvingut de nou." La seva resposta va ser un suau zumbido en reconeixement. No necessitava parlar molt per ella per entendre la seva intenció, o la resta del que tenia per dir.<br/><br/>La va portar de tornada al seu llit, la va instal·lar amb facilitat. Els seus ulls es van trobar amb els seus i ella va somriure fàcilment perquè no més records es van tornar enrere, no més records es burlaven d'ella. No, cada vegada que estava a prop, mai va caure de nou en aquells pensaments. Ell havia ajudat, i els anys havien ajudat. Avui va ser... un d'aquells dies.<br/><br/>"Dormir." Va ordenar amb facilitat, els ulls es van girar cap a ell, però ella no va lluitar perquè estava cansada. La seva mà es va aferrar fortament a ell, mentre que ella va sentir la seva mà oposada pressionar al front en l'avaluació del seu benestar.<br/><br/>"Estic bé", va dir, les seves paraules fermes amb la seva promesa.<br/><br/>Estava bé, era viva, i era feliç.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>expedidor<br/><br/>Resum<br/><br/>Kagome, en un moment de la seva vida, era una adolescent bastant regular fins que va ser atacada per un dimoni dins de la casa del pou de la seva família. El dimoni la va arrossegar cap al pou, el que màgicament la va transportar uns 500 anys en el passat. Allà, va saber que una joia sagrada estava tancada dins del seu cos, ja que era la reencarnació d'una sacerdotessa que havia mort 50 anys abans del moment en què va ser arrossegada. La joia va ser arrencada del seu cos i el dimoni que la va arrossegar a través del temps va ser derrotat pel mig dimoni que ella va alliberar que estava fixat a l'arbre. Kagome es va fer amiga del mig dimoni, Inuyasha, en el temps i va viatjar amb ell per restaurar la joia que ella, ella mateixa, va trencar. Encara que no era tan senzill i fàcil de fer com molts dimonis i humans van buscar la joia per als seus propis propòsits. Es va fer amiga d'un jove dimoni kitsune, d'un monjo i d'una caçadora de dimonis que van viatjar amb ella per restaurar la joia.<br/><br/>El seu grup, però, no va ser el que va completar la joia. En canvi, un malvat mig dimoni que va manipular la majoria dels esdeveniments importants en la majoria de les vides de la seva companya. Quan finalment va recollir totes les peces de la joia i va fer el seu desig sobre l'objecte contaminat, Kagome va ser arrossegat a la pròpia joia amb la intenció de fer un desig egoista de mantenir-la atrapada dins per sempre, mantenint la joia viva. Va ser l'obstinació d'Inuyasha que va aconseguir salvar-la de la foscor. Al final, va tornar al seu temps natural, va acabar l'escola secundària com s'esperava d'una noia de la seva línia de temps. Encara que dies després, Kagome va acabar a Elysion. Ha estat en aquest món durant cinc anys, i fa temps que ha renunciat a tornar a casa. S'ha instal·lat feliçment en la seva nova vida.<br/><br/>platònica<br/><br/>És bastant fàcil per a Kagome fer nous amics, ella no ha canviat molt des de la seva joventut. Ella és una jove alegre que és empàtica i acollidora a la major part de tot en la seva vida. En la seva joventut, es va fer amiga dels dimonis quan la majoria els temia. Fins i tot els dimonis que solien menjar-se els humans, ella s'ha fet amiga i ha canviat les seves maneres (li agradaria pensar). Dit això, és molt fàcil convertir-se en el seu amic sempre que algú és capaç de demostrar que estan disposats a ser redimits, o mostrar que no són completament dolents. Ella se sent molt per tots els que coneix, de manera que és difícil per a ella no ser atret pels altres en el desig de ser amics.<br/><br/>antagònic<br/><br/>L'única manera de guanyar la ira de Kagome és ser tan deplorable, tan dolent, i tan lluny més enllà de la redempció que ella no pot veure cap bé en tu. I ella pot veure el bé en gairebé tothom i tot. Sincerament, amb qui s'ha enfrontat? Un mig dimoni que va enfrontar dos amants l'un contra l'altre, que va maleir tota la línia masculina d'un dels seus amics, i després va fer que el germà del seu millor amic matés la seva família... Sí, no la veig odiar ningú sense ells realment, realment treballant per això. No obstant això, no dubtis a donar-li un tret.<br/><br/>romàntic<br/><br/>Quan està enamorada, Kagome és un fort suport, sempre romanent allà, fins i tot quan les coses poden ser difícils. No obstant això, Kagome no està buscant l'amor, no estava buscant l'amor quan va arribar així que les relacions passades no existeixen. Això no vol dir que algú no s'ha enamorat d'ella. Definitivament pot ser el subjecte de l'amor no correspost d'algú, probablement ho ignorarà, però. Finalment, Kagome està compromesa actualment amb Sesshoumaru, sorprenentment. Tot i això, estic oberta a les possibilitats. <3<br/><br/>fandom infern<br/><br/>edat antiga<br/><br/>espècie space queen<br/><br/>ocupació morint<br/><br/>Prefereix el/la<br/><br/>Premis<br/><br/>pro ella / ella és 62woo i xuclar a les respostes de la trama. però d'acord de totes maneres!!!

Neptú definitivament tracta d'envoltar-se de persones, perquè li encanta tenir amics, i kagome és bastant el seu tipus també? com ella és dolça i ella és una dona forta, i ell és en realitat millors amics amb les dones que ell és amb els homes, idk per què, li encanta estar envoltat d'amics femenins que sap.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Per què hauries d'estar a Twitter<br/><br/>Avís legal: No sóc, ni he afirmat mai ser, un guru de les xarxes socials. Sóc només una persona que pensa molt en les coses, i això ha aparegut diverses vegades.<br/><br/>No sóc un adoptant primerenc. De vegades em triga anys a esbrinar per què vull utilitzar alguna cosa abans d'aconseguir-ho, i Twitter va ser una d'aquestes coses. He estat a Twitter seriosament des de febrer d'aquest any, així que sóc bastant nou en això. Tot i així, he après moltes coses, i volia compartir-les. Algunes persones diuen que sóc un impulsor de Twitter, i ho sóc, perquè hi ha moltes bones raons per entrar-hi, i pràcticament no hi ha desavantatges.<br/><br/>Així que què és Twitter? Si estàs a Internet, probablement almenys n'has sentit a parlar. És una xarxa de xarxes socials que serveix com a fòrum per a converses, actualitzacions i notícies en un mitjà més públic que alguna cosa com Facebook o LinkedIn. Facebook tracta sobre qui vol trobar-te, però Twitter tracta sobre qui vols trobar. Els teus escriptors, actors, polítics, cantants i científics preferits probablement estan a Twitter. Així com les teves organitzacions benèfiques preferides, estacions de ràdio, llocs de notícies i botigues. I volen que els trobis i escoltis el que tenen a dir. Tothom a Twitter, almenys inicialment, vol parlar amb tu.<br/><br/>Però per què unir-se a això? Per què ser-ne part? Hi ha tot tipus de raons, i us en donaré unes quantes.<br/><br/>Persones i llocs Twitter és una gran manera de conèixer els esdeveniments que estan passant a tot el món, però també a la teva comunitat. Si estàs viatjant i busques coses per fer, és una gran manera de descobrir coses rellevants per als teus interessos (perquè les persones que segueixes són persones que t'interessen). Fins i tot si no estàs viatjant, conèixer els millors llocs on anar localment o saber que les persones que t'interessen van a ells crea una oportunitat per conèixer-los i crear una relació més profunda amb ells. Si tornes al meu post de festa, totes les persones que hi ha, excepte dues, en vaig sentir parlar a Twitter i després ens vam conèixer a la vida real, i ara som bastant bons amics. I com més ho fas, més coses descobriràs, i més gent coneixeràs. I si els segueixes a Twitter, ja saps una mica sobre com són. Ells volen que ho facis. El revés també és cert, perquè els tuits conviden a la gent a veure com ets, i poden prendre les mateixes decisions sobre tu.<br/><br/>Inspiració i motivació<br/>La inspiració ve dels llocs més estranys, i l'afluència de tuits significa que sempre hi ha contingut fresc per a la vostra imaginació. Tinc una política de seguiment primer, així que seguiré a gairebé tothom, i després periòdicament passar i deixar de seguir a la gent. No sé qui plantarà la llavor d'una nova entrada del blog o nou projecte en mi, així que m'agrada mantenir les meves opcions obertes. La motivació també passa, perquè Twitter és com la vida. Si t'envoltes de persones ambicioses, dedicades, generoses i treballadores, és més fàcil ser així i empènyer-te. És més fàcil pensar que si poden planificar esdeveniments, llançar projectes, o simplement aixecar-se al matí, bé, també pots.<br/><br/>Els blocaires d'aprenentatge i estil de vida estan a Twitter. Els blocaires que no ho són en realitat poden estar bojos. I la gent bloc sobre gairebé tot. Si busqueu aprendre alguna cosa, les probabilitats són bones que algú estigui tuitejant sobre això. A més d'això, els serveis de notícies i botigues també estan connectats, el que significa que vostè pot obtenir les seves notícies fins al minut, i esbrinar sobre les vendes i ofertes a mesura que comencen. Pel que fa a l'estil de vida, a la recerca de noves idees de receptes? Segueix alguns caterers i veure el que vénen amb. Necessites un gir per a aquesta festa de còctel? Twitter té gent per a això també. Recomanacions d'armari, o simplement vol veure el que altres persones estan fent amb les seves vides? Tot està allà.<br/><br/>Hi ha alguns reptes comuns que m'enfronto quan parlo d'això, i són obstacles legítims. Pot semblar bastant espantós, especialment si t'estàs posant en el vagó tard, com ho vaig fer. Vaig passar mesos seguint només dues persones i sense saber què més fer. Però hi ha maneres de superar-los, i escoltar que són de menys freqüents a la majoria.<br/><br/>#3 Twitter és per als narcisistes<br/>Crec que això ve de la idea que la majoria de la gent tuiteja per i sobre ells mateixos com una manera d'aconseguir l'atenció. El que no entenc és per què hi ha alguna cosa malament amb això, o per què fer això fa un narcisista o un imbècil. Si algú té alguna cosa a dir, vol ser escoltat. Solia ser que estaries a la cantonada del carrer i cridar. Ara pots cridar en 140 caràcters o menys. Twitter és només una nova manera de ser escoltat. Ara, sens dubte, hi ha imbècils narcisistes a Twitter. Són a tot arreu. De vegades, la gent és imbècil. De vegades, una d'aquestes persones sóc jo, em sap greu dir-ho. No segueixis aquestes persones. Si no t'agrada el que algú està dient, ja siguin punts que estan fent o comptes detallats de les seves activitats de bany, no has d'escoltar a Twitter.<br/><br/>#2 No puc fer-ne un seguiment<br/>El segon obstacle que les persones sovint plantegen és que simplement no tenen temps per fer un seguiment de totes les coses que estan passant a Twitter. I saps què? Això està bé. Fer un seguiment del que pots. Potser només passeges cada pocs dies. Si ets un usuari privat (en lloc de tuitejar per a la teva empresa), i especialment un principiant, està bé. Part d'alguna cosa és millor que tot el res.<br/><br/>#1 No tinc res que vull posar allà fora<br/>Aquest és, de lluny, el repte més freqüent que la gent planteja. I ni tan sols importa. No has d'unir-te a Twitter per parlar. Uneix-te a ell per escoltar. Un cop més, els teus autors, cantants, bloggers i diaris favorits estan aquí. Aquesta és la teva oportunitat d'escoltar-los. És la teva oportunitat d'aconseguir una finestra a les seves vides i activitats, i us conviden a fer-ho. Vols esbrinar què farà Felicia Day a la San Diego Comic Con? Fet. Conec gent que només escolta a Twitter, i això és genial. Això és el que vaig fer durant una estona. Al final, potser trobareu alguna cosa sobre la qual tuitejar, o fer alguna cosa sobre la qual tuitejar. Espero que ho feu, perquè vull sentir-ho.<br/><br/>En definitiva, si no estàs utilitzant Twitter, crec que ho hauries de ser. Si no l'estàs utilitzant en tota la seva extensió, intenta-ho. No tinguis por de seguir cinc-centes persones, si totes aquestes persones estan dient coses que t'interessen. Convida a aquestes persones a entrar en parts de la teva vida, i veure com s'ha millorat per la interacció. Estic desitjant escoltar de tu. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Canals arrel<br/><br/>El mateix pensament d'aconseguir un canal radicular posa la majoria de la gent a la vora. SCM Dental utilitza l'última tecnologia i tècnica per fer un canal radicular un procediment pràcticament lliure de dolor i baix estrès.<br/><br/>L'endodòncia rotatòria és una tecnologia i tècnica avançada per realitzar un tractament endodòntic, el terme clínic per a un canal radicular. El nervi de la dent es troba en el teixit tou (polpa) dins del canal radicular. Si la dent està danyada ja sigui per traumatisme o càries, els residus poden entrar a la zona sensible del canal radicular i causar una infecció, o en circumstàncies extremes, i abscés. Una dent abscés és molt greu i s'ha de tractar com una emergència, ja que pot crear una infecció que es pot estendre a altres parts del cos. Si creu que té una dent abscés, contacti immediatament amb la nostra oficina per programar atenció d'emergència.<br/><br/>Depenent del cas, la teràpia del canal radicular pot requerir més d'una visita. Es farà una radiografia inicial per avaluar la dent i el canal radicular i determinar l'extensió del dany i la infecció si hi són presents. Se li donarà una forma d'anestèsia per relaxar-se.<br/><br/>Quan l’àrea està adormida, el nostre dentista crearà una cambra d’accés al canal radicular utilitzant una peça de mà elèctrica. A continuació, el canal radicular serà raspat del teixit i el nervi infectats o danyats. Una vegada que tota la zona s'ha netejat i polit a fons, la dent s'omplirà amb un compost de goma biocompatible anomenat gutta percha. La dent es cobreix amb un farciment dental o corona dental per restaurar la força i la funció.<br/><br/>La teràpia endodòncia té una mala reputació com a procediment dolorós. Amb endodòncia rotatòria, un procediment de canal radicular no és més dolorós que tenir una farciment dental col·locat. La infecció i el dany al nervi és el que crea el dolor extrem i la incomoditat i els pacients experimentaran un alleujament significatiu després de sotmetre's a la teràpia de canal radicular. Els canals radiculars tenen una taxa d’èxit del 95% i permeten a les persones preservar les seves dents naturals. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Bosc de fons de l'església<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Bosc de fons de l'església, Highgate<br/><br/>El Bosc de la Reina<br/><br/>Entre 1860 i 1880 el centre va ser arrancat de la ciutat de Londres per construir clavegueres, ferrocarrils i noves carreteres. Les cases van ser demolides sense tenir en compte els llogaters que havien de trobar qualsevol allotjament que poguessin en altres llocs. Els gerents van anar a livo a Kensington i St. John's Wood, mentre que els més pobres es van aplegar a les rookeries com Seven Dials i Lisson Grove. Per a aquells entre ells, els funcionaris i els treballadors qualificats, els constructors especulatius van posar fila rere fila de viles en terrasses i el senyor Pooter es va traslladar a Holloway. La gent de Muswell Hill va observar cases arrossegant-se a través dels camps de Finsbury Park, dalt Crouch Hill i a l'altre costat, de manera que el 1880, Crouch End estava sent desenvolupat i semblava que no hi havia manera d'aturar el flux. Deu anys més tard es venien les grans finques de Muswell Hill. Upton Farm es va vendre i els Comissionats Eclesiàstics volien desenvolupar Churchyard Bottom Wood, ara anomenat Queen's Wood. La història hauria fet una obra d'Ibsen. Dos grups de persones honestes i molt motivades lluitant pel que cadascú pensava que era correcte. Els Comissionats Eclesiàstics d'una banda i el Comitè de les Caritats Hornsey de l'altra, tots dos creien que estaven fent el millor per a altres persones, i el públic es va aixecar contra ells en indignació.<br/><br/>En aquell moment Muswell Hill Road era un camí rural, amb Southwood Hall en un extrem i Upton Farm a l'altre. El 1894 es va construir Onslow Gardens, Connaught Gardens marcat, i els constructors estaven preparats per desenvolupar la finca Woodlands. Tallat de Churchyard Bottom Wood va ser un grup de cases de vacances en caiguda, en un lloc triangular. Un mapa sense data, en possessió dels Comissaris Eclesiàstics mostra sis Cottages Wasteland amb una obertura entre ells - no un camí, no metal·litzat, sinó un camí a través dels llits de maduixa darrere. Més endavant hi havia un altre buit que conduïa a camins a través del bosc. Aquestes dues obertures havien de ser la base del plànol. Els mateixos dos buits i el terreny despejat, que era el camp de maduixa, es pot veure en el mapa de 1894 a continuació. Es mostren com a 'Muswell Hill Cottages' i, de passada, Peter Sellers havia de viure al mateix lloc molt més tard. Per desenvolupar la fusta com un habitatge, els comissaris necessitaven conduir dues carreteres a través de Muswell Hill Road i construir cases al llarg d'ells. La façana de Muswell Hill Road per si sola no hauria proporcionat espai per a suficients cases per fer que l'empresa valgués la pena.<br/><br/>La terra i les cases de camp havien estat donades molt abans com a cases d'almoina per allotjar gent gran i eren mantingudes en el seu nom pels administradors dels comissaris de la caritat de Hornsey. Pels anys 1890 les cases es van enfonsar, necessitant una reparació important. Amb esperit públic, desitjant fer el millor per als seus vells inquilins, els administradors no podien millorar-los ja que no tenien diners. Alguns anys abans, els comissaris eclesiàstics havien planejat desenvolupar Gravel Pit Wood (ara Highgate Wood) com un habitatge, però això havia trobat tanta oposició que es van retirar. En canvi, el 1886, van donar tots els 69 acres de bosc al públic. Al mateix temps, es van oferir a vendre Churchyard Bottom Wood al Consell del Districte Urbà de Hornsey per 25.000 £, però això era massa per a Hornsey per recaptar per si mateix. El Consell va dir que les persones que viuen fora de Hornsey també van gaudir de la fusta i altres autoritats han d'ajudar, però no es va donar cap ajuda. Al final, l'oferta va caure en suspens.<br/><br/>Mapa que mostra les cabanes de Muswell Hill que van ser el centre de la controvèrsia.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road al voltant de 1880<br/><br/>Sembla probable que aquestes tres parelles de cases fossin les que estaven al centre de la disputa.<br/><br/>Els comissaris eclesiàstics volien recaptar diners per al seu treball a l'església a Gran Bretanya i a l'estranger. Consideraven que se'ls havia donat la terra per ser utilitzada per a la promoció de la religió i si això significava vendre terres o boscos, era un mal menor que restringir el treball de l'església. Havien donat Gravel Pit Wood al públic: en el seu lloc desenvoluparien Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Els síndics de les organitzacions benèfiques Hornsey volien produir un ingrés per ajudar als seus pobres, així que van fer una oferta als comissaris. El seu tros de terra triangular tenia una forma massa incòmoda per ser desenvolupat econòmicament, però si els comissaris els concedien una mica més de terra per convertir-la en un lloc quadrat, construirien vint-i-cinc viles netes. Aquests portaria en lloguers de terra de £ 225 per any, que podria ser utilitzat per alleujar la pobresa de la gent de Hornsey. En canvi, permetrien a la Comissió ers per tallar dues carreteres a través de la seva terra perquè els comissaris podrien desenvolupar els boscos.<br/><br/>Quan aquesta oferta es va fer coneguda la gent immediatament va reaccionar amb alarma.<br/><br/>El 16 de desembre de 1893, el diputat Carvell Williams va preguntar a la Cambra dels Comuns si els comissionats eclesiàstics havien consentit a vendre una franja de terra als administradors de la caritat de Hornsey amb la condició que una carretera existent s'amplís a 40 peus, si això era un preliminar a un esquema de construcció i si la Cambra del Parlament tindria l'oportunitat d'express.<br/><br/>El senyor Leveson Gower, un comissari d'Estats de l'Església, va respondre "Sí" a la primera part.<br/><br/>Carvell Williams: "Entenc que és la intenció de destruir aquesta porció de Highgate Woods construint-hi?"<br/><br/>Dos dies després The Star va publicar un article digne de qualsevol tabloide modern.<br/><br/>L'estrella<br/>18 de desembre de 1893<br/><br/>'El Parlament ha de vigilar atentament a aquells antics vàndals i confederats del constructor de jerry els comissaris eclesiàstics.

Els comissaris no van vendre la fusta del fons de l'església als contribuents, però ara proposen "obrir-la" tallant dues carreteres amples a través d'ella en connexió amb un dels seus nombrosos esquemes de construcció. Algú no farà una pregunta al Parlament i comprovarà la política de maons i morters dels comissaris?<br/><br/>En el moment en què es va imprimir això, la pregunta s’havia fet i la resposta era falsa o tortuosa. Altres papers van prendre la història. El Times, en un llarg informe, va dir que els Comnusioners no estaven preparats per fer un compromís que el Parlament, o qualsevol altre organisme públic, hagués de tenir l'oportunitat de considerar qualsevol esquema per construir en el lloc de la fusta.<br/><br/>La situació va bullir durant divuit mesos fins que els comissaris eclesiàstics es van veure obligats a obrir una investigació, que va començar a Highgate el 31 de maig de 1895, presidida per un comissari eclesiàstic assistent. La investigació va produir una avalancha de cartes periodístiques, de les quals aquesta va ser la més important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 de juny de 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISME A L'ALTA PORTA<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Un dels trossos més encantadors de bosc a Londres suburània està amenaçat. Ens ajudarà a allunyar el que seria una calamitat, no només al districte immediat, sinó a tot el nord densament poblat de Londres? En cap part de la metròpoli el constructor ha estat més actiu que a Crouch End i Hornsey. Els bells prats de fa un any o dos són ara cases i botigues. Els munts de llast han pres el lloc dels magnífics olms i castanyes, i una vegada que els pobles agradables estan compartint el destí de Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury i Islington.<br/><br/>---- L'objecte és la construcció de dues carreteres de quaranta peus a través del bosc.

Darwin havia dividit la creença en els ensenyaments de l'Església i molta gent hauria ressentit el poder de l'Església només des d'aquest punt de vista. L'Església no era tan segura com pretenia ser.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 de juny de 1895 va dir:<br/><br/>"Si els comunions eclesiàstics no són abordats a la vegada, el pop de l'edifici obtindrà un agafament de la fusta que serà molt difícil de deslligar més tard, ---. Per tant, convé que els londinencs estiguin dempeus i ho facin si volen salvar un dels seus trossos més encantadors de paisatge rústic. La investigació pública s'ajorna al proper dijous, i abans d'això s'ha de fer alguna cosa per convèncer els comissaris que els ciutadans de Londres no toleraran la confiscació d'un dels seus parcs infantils favorits.<br/><br/>Una carta al Daily Chronicle l'endemà va dir:<br/><br/>.... Va ser amb gran alleujament que els residents, fa uns deu anys, van sentir que la compra del bosc superior havia estat efectuada; i com de agradable ha demostrat una benedicció això, qualsevol que els va visitar pot testificar, però tots els que es van esforçar per salvar aquests boscos superiors, que es troben al costat oest de la carretera de Muswell Hill, va sentir que la seva victòria era incompleta mentre els seixanta a l'est. És, per dir-ho així, un accident que els boscos estiguin dividits per una àmplia carretera alta. Pot algú dubtar quin seria l’efecte si el Bosc del fons de l’església fos substituït per fileres de petites viles, cadascuna enviant la seva aportació de fum i sutge? Pot algú dubtar, també, de la seriosa diferència que faria a l'entorn pintoresc dels boscos comprats si una línia de mirades noves cases fossin atropellades directament contra la seva façana frondosa?<br/><br/>Això va expressar les opinions de molta gent. De fet, el Gravel Pit Wood, que l'escriptor anomena el 'Upper Wood', no havia estat comprat, sinó donat al districte per la Comissió Eclesiàstica, un punt que havien de reiterar una i altra vegada al llarg dels anys, però la majoria de la gent l'ignorava. La Comissió no anava a donar una segona fusta el que algú va dir, i va mantenir aquesta posició fins al final.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, de 5 Cranley Gardens, en una carta al Times datada el 8 de juny de 1895, va instar a la compra.<br/><br/>Sé que és comú parlar amb duresa dels comissaris eclesiàstics, etc., però com que els administradors d'un fons estan obligats a administrar-lo amb el major avantatge, i per tant, si s'ha de fer alguna cosa per salvar la demolició del bosc, em sembla que només es pot fer per la compra de la propietat dels Comuners, que jo sé, estan plenament vius a la protecció de la llibertat.<br/><br/>(Això es refereix als camps de joc Crouch End que havien estat assegurats uns anys més tard.)<br/><br/>Com a president de l'Associació Conservadora Muswell Hill, estic en contacte constant amb els habitants, i puc afirmar amb seguretat que cada persona resident al barri faria qualsevol cosa per preservar-lo.<br/><br/>(Tot el que volia personalment era ingressos de la caritat per donar suport a la seva gent pobra. Va exigir el seu acre de terra - no molt segurament - que creia la garantia dels comissaris que el bosc no estava en perill.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road era una de les millors de Hornsey i seguiria sent igual de bonica, cases o sense cases.<br/><br/>(I després va arribar el gran floriment retòric.)<br/><br/>'Són els pobres a patir a causa de les objeccions sentimentals i el crit histèric de 'llop acaba d'alçar pels seus corresponsals? Alguna cosa s'ha de fer i que aviat. Un acre de terra afegit a l'Estat de la caritat no faria cap diferència apreciable a la terra restant, mentre que el benefici derivat d'ella ajudaria a moltes persones pobres, velles i mereixedores en els seus anys de decadència i ens permetria lliurar als nostres successors una propietat que en un futur llunyà seria de gran valor en la prestació d'ajuda caritativa als pobres merenys de la parròquia de Hornsey.<br/><br/>Llegint la seva carta un sent histèria molt a prop de la superfície. Per què va pensar que els comissaris volien construir una carretera? Per què haurien de gastar tots aquests diners si no per construir cases? Mai semblava adonar-se que per un acre de terra tot el bosc es perdria. Però ell havia estat amb el problema durant molt de temps. Va ser la persona a qui els Comissionats havien fet l'oferta de venda per 25.000 £ anys abans i és el seu nom el que s'honora en una placa a la Torre del Rellotge de Crouch End per salvar la fusta, però la seva confiança en els Comissionats Eclesiàstics sembla ingènua. És una llàstima que en la investigació hagi estat llançat com el diable.<br/><br/>La investigació continua<br/><br/>L'ajornament es va obrir a Highgate el 15 de juny de 1895. Esperant una gran reunió, la Cambra del Consell havia estat canviada completament. Les taules habituals havien estat eliminades i la sala s'havia omplert de cadires. A les set i mitja de la tarda la sala estava plena, i la gent s'estava atropellant per agafar seients.<br/><br/>El Sr Murray, el comissari, va dir que la investigació era realment simple. Hornsey Parochial Charities desitjava comprar un terreny adjacent a la seva propietat de caritat a la part posterior. La pregunta era si la Comissió de Caritat, que controlava totes les organitzacions benèfiques, tenia prou poder per aturar-les. Els comissaris de l'Església estaven disposats a vendre la terra en termes molt favorables i els ingressos de la Caritat s'incrementarien molt considerablement.<br/><br/>En contra hi havia tres classes d’objecció.<br/><br/>El Trust original tenia el propòsit de proporcionar cases per als pobres, però els administradors estaven proposant construir viles que serien massa cars per als pobres. No obstant això, estava dins del poder dels administradors per variar els termes del Trust, de manera que podien construir viles si creien que els pobres es beneficiarien al final. Els mateixos pobres podien objectar, però ja s’havien promès disposicions liberals per a ells. La tercera objecció es referia al costat estètic i públic de la qüestió. Va prendre d'allò que havia llegit que la Comissió de Caritat havia d'interferir per evitar que els Comissionats Eclesiàstics exercissin la seva pròpia discreció en tractar amb els seus propis béns.<br/><br/>La investigació va discutir punts bons, però els oradors van continuar tornant al problema principal d'evitar qualsevol destrucció de la fusta. El secretari de Vestry d'Islington, que representava 300.000 persones, va fer una protesta formal sobre qualsevol part de la fusta, tan valuosa per als habitants d'Islington i Hornsey que s'utilitzava per a fins privats. Wilfred White va dir que si els comissaris els donaven temps podrien recaptar els diners per compensar els administradors.<br/><br/>Beaumont va dir que no volien viles, volien cases per a la gent pobra que estava sent expulsada del districte. Altres van dir que no hi havia diners per construir cases de camp per reemplaçar les actuals delapidades, però les viles serien una proposició econòmica. Altres van respondre que hi havia desenes de viles per deixar entrar Highgate. El Bosc era sagrat. Endavant amb la qüestió de la fusta.<br/><br/>El doctor Fletcher va dir que el crit entre la gent treballadora era que no hi havia cap lloc on anar. La gent treballadora es va acostar a ell amb el crit, "Estem expulsats de Highgate i estem obligats a anar a Highgate New Town." Si es venia la façana de Muswell Hill Road no hi havia cap dubte, però que les carreteres podrien ser tallades a través del bosc en direcció a Hornsey, però si els comissaris no podien obtenir la terra de la Comissió de Caritat no podien tallar la carretera.<br/><br/>Ell estava molt segur que les cases es podrien posar en un estat adequat de reparació. La gent pobra, la policia i una sèrie de classes treballadores li van demanar que representés aquests dos punts, que l'allotjament de la casa de camp era molt necessari a Highgate i que si un dia permetien la venda de la terra, no hi havia ni idea d'on estaria la mà del constructor.<br/><br/>(Aplaudiments alts i prolongats).<br/><br/>Nombroses altres persones van parlar i el Comnusioner va resumir dient que va prendre que l'opinió prevalent era a favor de mantenir les cases de camp, però la reunió no ha de treure conclusions del que havia dit (Groans).<br/><br/>Altres van dir que els administradors de la caritat havien fallat en les seves funcions en deixar que les cases caiguessin en mal estat.<br/><br/>El senyor H.R. Williams, el síndic que havia escrit al diari abans, va dir que tenia la millor autoritat que els comissionats de l'Església no fessin carreteres i que no se'ls beneficiaria ni un iota per les accions dels comissionats de la caritat. Altres van ser molt menys confiats i la reunió va tancar després de gairebé tres hores.<br/><br/>"Ens enfrontem al fet que a Highgate i Muswell Hill hi ha una sèrie de persones que volen el bosc del fons de l'església i no seran feliços fins que ho tinguin, mentre que ningú sembla disposat a gastar un penny per pagar-ho. Tothom diu que seria una bona cosa tenir la fusta com a espai obert, però tothom pensa que és el deure d'algú altre fer-ne un. El Islington Vestry ha "resolt" sobre el tema, però el Islington Vestry no ofereix una peça de cèntim cap a la compra. No hi ha problema més difícil de resoldre per a la comunitat o per a l'individu que la forma d'aconseguir la possessió de la propietat d'altres persones sense pagar per ella.<br/><br/>Pagar per això va ser de fet el problema, ja que Churchyard Bottom Wood va ser objecte d'intens debat local i nacional. Es va formar un comitè conjunt per recaptar diners per salvar la fusta. El 20 de novembre de 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, tresorer honorífic, va escriure a The Standard, un diari de l'època, demanant ajuda. Va recordar a tothom el perill de perdre la fusta i va dir que només es podia salvar comprant-la. Els comissionats de l'Església es vendrien per £ 25,000 i un extra (5.000 es requeririen per a la tanca i el drenatge, fent un total de £ 30,000. Això era massa per al Consell de Hornsey per augmentar, però ja havien votat £ 10,000 cap al total. Els boscos eren d'un valor inestimable per a tot el nord de Londres, de manera que va apel·lar als organismes públics i persones privades per recaptar les 20.000 lliures restants. Va advertir que l'oferta actual dels Comissionats de l'Església estava oberta només a la fi de 1898. Posteriorment, els constructors s’hi van traslladar.<br/><br/>L'apel·lació va ser calorosament benvinguda per la premsa. Un projecte de llei privat es va precipitar a través del Parlament i la Llei de Preservació de Highgate Woods, 1897, es va convertir en llei. La comunitat ara tenia el dret de fer publicitat de les contribucions a la compra de la fusta i preservar-la.<br/><br/>En un temps bastant curt es van recaptar gairebé tots els diners, però els últims milers van resultar molt difícils de recaptar i el termini dels comissaris era qüestió de setmanes. Cory-Wright va escriure una petició per més temps, però se li va concedir només tres mesos i després només si es pagava un interès del 4% pel període addicional sobre la suma completa. Al final, el Consell del Comtat de Londres, que originalment havia ofert 2.500 lliures, va fer això fins a 5.000 lliures i el total va ser aconseguit, però va ser una cosa de curta durada.<br/><br/>El Consell va decidir reanomenar el Bosc com a "Bosc de la Reina" en honor del Jubileu de Diamant de la Reina Victòria i Hornsey va posar una bona exhibició de matisos quan la Duquessa d'Albany va declarar formalment el Bosc obert "per a l'ús lliure del públic per sempre".<br/><br/>Mentre que la campanya per salvar Churchyard Bottom Wood va ser dirigida i dirigida per gent local que sentia apassionadament per aquesta peça particular de bosc, van demanar l'ajuda i l'experiència d'una vasta xarxa de persones, algunes de les quals havien treballat juntes en campanyes similars durant més de trenta anys. El Comitè va emetre una apel·lació, impresa en paper de molt bona qualitat i amb alguns noms famosos.<br/><br/>Les qüestions de l'espai obert i la salut pública van ser temes principals de la visió victoriana.<br/><br/>El Moviment Espais Oberts<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, la gran reformadora d'habitatges, que havia començat amb tres cases antigues a Marylebone, comprades per ella per Jolm Ruskin, s'havia convertit ràpidament en una experta en habitatges per a pobres en les condicions més sanes possibles. La seva manera era comprar lloguers i després abatre algunes de les cases plegades per tal d'aportar llum i aire a la resta, creient que l'aire fresc i la llum del sol eren l'única manera que la gent pobra podia salvar-se de la febre pútrida. Va aprendre això quan era una nena del seu avi, Southwood Smith, que va desenvolupar les seves teories a l'Hospital de Febre de King's Cross.<br/><br/>Havia construït les primeres Habitatges Industrials per a persones pobres i havia demostrat estadísticament que el bon aire i el drenatge decent salvaven vides. Gibson Gardens, a Northwold Road, és un resultat directe de les idees de Southwood Smith. Més informació a Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>La importància de l’aire lliure<br/><br/>Els espais oberts i l'oportunitat de respirar aire net, eren essencials per a les persones que vivien en una o dues habitacions concorregudes. Octavia Hill va portar les seves càrregues des dels barris pobres de Lisson Grove, a l'avinguda de Fitzjohn a Hampstead Heath. Va estimar tant els camps de l'avinguda Fitzjohn que va intentar comprar-los com un parc públic. Van costar £ 10.000 i en tres setmanes d'agost s'havien recaptat £ 8.500. Només necessitava el final de les vacances d'estiu i la tornada de vacances d'amics simpàtics i les altres £ 1.500 s'haurien aixecat, però els propietaris de sobte van retirar la seva oferta. Malgrat tot plegat, els camps estaven coberts de grans cases.<br/><br/>A partir d'això es va desenvolupar la campanya per salvar el turó del Parlament, el proper espai obert cap al nord de Lisson Grove, comprant camps en el camí dels constructors per fer un cordó sanitari permanent contra els maons que avançaven. La campanya del Parlament Hill Fields va tenir tant d'èxit que es va aprovar el projecte de llei Hampstead Heath i hi va haver diners de l'atracció. D'aquests diners i l'impuls cap a espais oberts, va ser desenvolupar el National Trust. Octavia Hill havia estat interessada en protegir àrees com el Bosc de fons de l'Església durant anys, de manera que va ser un aliat natural en la lluita per salvar el Bosc.<br/><br/>La Societat de Preservació dels Comuns també estava familiaritzada amb aquest tipus d'agitació i recaptació de diners. Havien enderrocat esgrima quan els senyors de la mansió havien tancat trossos de terra comuna, liderant batalles legals i il·legals contra la privatització arrogant de terres tradicionalment lliures. Robert Hunter, el seu sol·licitant honorari de 1868, sempre es va preocupar d'assegurar espais oberts, grans o petits, per al públic. Ell, ara Sir Robert Hunter, es va convertir en el president de l'apel·lació inferior de l'Església. El President de la Societat de Preservació dels Comuns va ser el Sr Shaw-Lefevre MP (més tard Lord Eversley) que va jugar un gran paper en aquesta i altres campanyes a la Cambra dels Comuns. Octavia Hill havia estat involucrat en el seu treball des d'aproximadament 1875.<br/><br/>Al mateix temps, Octavia Hill estava fent campanya per un projecte de llei d'enterraments.<br/><br/>Els cementiris de la ciutat s'havien tornat tan plens i tan greu un perill per a la salut, contaminant pous dels quals la gent treia l'aigua potable, que els enterraments de la ciutat ja no estaven permesos. En canvi, es van crear cementiris als afores de la ciutat. El cementiri Abney Park va ser un d'aquests. Hi va haver llavors un moviment per treure les làpides a les vores dels cementiris de la ciutat vella, re-internar els cossos en altres llocs i convertir els cementiris en jardins i espais oberts, en lloc de construir-los. Aquesta terra al centre de Londres era molt valuosa i els especuladors estaven ansiosos per obtenir-la: fins i tot els quàquers havien construït sobre una de les seves cementiris i amenaçaven de fer-ho de nou construint sobre Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill tenia una xarxa d'aliats en una dotzena de camps, per la qual cosa la seva ajuda per salvar l'Església de Bosc de Fons devia ser inestimable.<br/><br/>La Metropolitan Gardens Society, creada el 1882, havia disposat uns dos-cents petits jardins als centres de les ciutats cap a 1890. Més tard els van lliurar a les autoritats locals, de manera que el seu suport a l'apel·lació de la fusta del fons de l'església es va assegurar des del principi.<br/><br/>La Societat Kyrle s'oblida ara, però en els seus dies va tenir una gran influència en la planificació urbana i la legislació de l'espai obert. La Societat s'havia constituït al voltant de 1875 per a 'la difusió de la bellesa', per aportar color i interès a la vida de les persones que viuen en entorns avorrits i tèrbols. Color brillant a les parets i la decoració, bon cant, espais oberts, Natura, Literatura i Art. Hi havia una branca decorativa, per a la qual William Morris donava conferències; una branca musical per promoure cors i nits felices per a la gent en edificis escolars locals; i una branca de literatura. La Societat va apel·lar regularment per cartes a The Times, a les "classes més riques" perquè els llibres i les revistes es distribuïssin als clubs de nens i nenes, cases d'almoines i en altres llocs. El mateix nom "Kyrle" prové de l'home de Ross, el filantrop que va donar el seu lloc de naixement a la gent com un parc públic. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Amb l'Acció de Gràcies a la cantonada, aquí hi ha alguns jocs de carpeta d'arxius festius que vam fer per a les nenes. Tots dos jocs d'Acció de Gràcies se centren en les habilitats matemàtiques. I estic agraït una vegada més al meu marit, Ed, per fer tots els clipart per a mi.<br/><br/>Patró d'acció de gràcies<br/><br/>Com el nom diu, aquest joc es tracta de fer patrons. Els més petits acaba d'aprendre sobre els patrons, poden simplement coincidir amb les imatges a les tires de patró, mentre que altres poden continuar el patró amb les targetes d'imatge a les tires en blanc.<br/><br/>Per fer la carpeta d'arxius, voleu tallar la quadrícula d'imatges per fer les peces de la targeta. Recomano laminar-les per ajudar-les a durar més. A continuació, enganxeu les tires de patró a la carpeta d'arxius.<br/><br/>Volia tenir les tires de patró en blanc també perquè les nenes poguessin veure on continuar el patró i quants posar. Els vaig adjuntar al costat de la carpeta utilitzant cinta perquè poguessin plegar-se per empaquetar el joc i estendre's a la disposició del patró.<br/><br/>També vaig afegir un blanc addicional perquè les nenes poguessin fer el seu propi patró també.<br/><br/>Joc de números de Turquia<br/><br/>En aquest joc les noies afegeixen les plomes al cos de l'ànec mentre practiquen el comptatge i el reconeixement de números. Vaig utilitzar les plomes incolores per actuar com a guia per a on afegir les plomes i perquè les noies poguessin coincidir amb els números. I assegureu-vos que quan enganxeu el cos de pavo només enganxeu al centre perquè les peces de les ales puguin lliscar sota el cos.<br/><br/>Un cop totes les plomes estan disposades, practiquem una mica d'aritmètica simple, com ara treure tres plomes i veure quantes queden i després afegir dues de nou per veure el que és igual.<br/><br/>A més de les ales en blanc i negre, també hem inclòs un gall dindi incolor en cas que vulguis que els més petits tinguin el seu propi conjunt. En lloc d'un joc de carpetes d'arxius, podeu convertir-lo en un artefacte, pintar les peces, tallar-les i enganxar-les.<br/><br/>Una altra opció és utilitzar les peces per fer una història de feltre de tauler. De vegades cantem una versió de Turquia de 10 petits indis:<br/><br/>Com aquest:<br/><br/>Qui sóc jo?<br/><br/>Crec que aquí és on haig de dir alguna cosa enginyosa sobre mi mateix. Oh bé. Sóc una mare que es queda a casa amb tres nens increïbles: les nostres filles bessones que ara tenen set anys i un fill de dos anys que està ple d'energia. En la meva vida pre-infantil vaig ser professor i ara estic educant a casa els nostres fills. També estic casat amb Ed, que actualment està servint a la Força Aèria, i és l'amor de la meva vida (seria incòmode si no ho fos). La nostra família és gran en els llibres, l'artesania, i divertir-se junts. Només vaig pensar que compartiria les nostres activitats en el meu propi petit racó d'Internet.<br/><br/>Zoe sembla tenir-ho tot - ric, atractiu marit, la vida de Nova York fàcil - però ella va cometre errors en el seu passat i aquests errors estan tornant a la seva nova vida. Em vaig trobar a la vora del meu seient per a la major part del llibre i em va sorprendre ...<br/><br/>M'ha encantat aquest llibre, m'encanta la història, i estic agraït Margot Shetterly va portar a la llum. La meva única queixa va ser que desitjava que ella va discutir el paper de Katherine Johnson en les missions posteriors una mica més, però suposo que la història havia d'acabar som ...<br/><br/>Volia agradar aquest llibre i ho vaig fer al llarg de la major part d'ell.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | El consum d'alcohol per persones menors de 21 anys s'ha identificat com un problema de salut pública important. Els estudis noten que augmenta els riscos per a la discapacitat, i pot ser perjudicial per al cervell en desenvolupament. Els menors que beuen són més propensos a suïcidar-se, infringir la llei, o ser víctimes de violència. L'alcohol està implicat en gairebé un terç de les morts de trànsit juvenil. El cost anual total de beure menors s'estima en $ 62 mil milions. Si bé la majoria de les lleis destinades a prevenir el consum de begudes per a menors d'edat es passen a nivell estatal, hi ha hagut activitat legislativa i interès a nivell federal per donar suport als esforços dels estats per frenar el problema. Aquest informe descriu l'abast del consum d'alcohol menors d'edat, l'activitat legislativa recent sobre aquest tema, i diverses implicacions polítiques. S'actualitzarà a mesura que noves dades estiguin disponibles. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

No va ser el lobby polític o les peticions públiques el que va resultar en la reforma alimentària, sinó més aviat un esforç de base liderat per ciutadans amb el poder d'implementar i seguir amb el canvi.<br/><br/>Vaig acabar el post al·ludint a una pregunta: Per què és tan difícil per a nosaltres fer-ho nosaltres mateixos, com a individus? Si tot un país pot implementar i difondre una visió comuna cap al menjar, per què no podem?<br/><br/>No hi ha res que ens impedeixi imitar l'èxit de Dinamarca. El problema és que estem inundats de tants missatges sobre què hauríem de menjar i com hauríem de viure, és difícil saber per on començar. Per tant, en lloc de seguir marcs reeixits que han demostrat funcionar (com el Manifest d'Aliments Nòrdics), la majoria de la gent salta de la bogeria de la dieta a la bogeria de la dieta, tractant de trobar la "manera correcta de menjar".<br/><br/>Però com va tenir èxit Claus Meyer? Quina va ser la salsa secreta que va ajudar al Manifest a agafar-se? I és raonable pensar que podem aplicar aquestes lliçons a les nostres pròpies vides?

La cruixent exterior única de la carn va donar pas a un interior perfectament sucós, resultant en un so més semblant a tallar en un calzone que un paté de carn de vedella triturat.<br/><br/>Estàvem asseguts al pub més antic de Copenhaguen, que se sentia més com un bistrot casual que un bar, i jo estava a punt de provar el plat recomanat per la nostra cambrera / bar tender / propietari?<br/><br/>"El Paris Beef, és molt bo", havia dit.
