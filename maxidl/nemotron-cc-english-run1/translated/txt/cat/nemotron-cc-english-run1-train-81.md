| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Fa quaranta-nou anys, el president Lyndon B. Johnson va signar la Llei de Drets de Vot de 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Fa gairebé un segle, la 15a Esmena a la Constitució va declarar: "El dret dels ciutadans dels Estats Units a votar no serà negat o abreujat pels Estats Units o per qualsevol estat a causa de la raça, el color o la condició prèvia de servitud". I gairebé un segle abans, els pares fundadors de la nostra nació van posar en marxa el gran experiment de la democràcia nord-americana declarant que "tots els homes són creats iguals".<br/><br/>La Llei de Drets de Vot de 1965 va ser un reconeixement tardà que fins i tot als Estats Units, els nostres ideals fonamentals tenen poc pes si no estan protegits per l'estat de dret. És per això que la Secció 2 de la 15a Esmena va concedir al Congrés el "poder d'aplicar aquest article mitjançant la legislació apropiada".<br/><br/>I de fet, el llenguatge codificat de la Llei de Drets de Vot va ser capaç d'aconseguir el que el Congrés de l'era de la Reconstrucció i Thomas Jefferson no van poder. La Llei de Drets Civils de 1964 i la Llei de Drets de Vot, i el moviment de drets civils del qual van sorgir, van servir com a catalitzador per a un augment dramàtic de l'oportunitat per als negres nord-americans de participar en el procés democràtic.<br/><br/>Per exemple, només el 6.7 per cent dels negres de Mississipí elegibles es van registrar per votar a partir de 1962; per 1969 aquesta xifra havia arribat al 66.5 per cent. Avui, Mississipí té més funcionaris electes negres que qualsevol altre estat.<br/><br/>Les proteccions posades en marxa per la Llei de Drets de Vot eren molt esperades quan van ser aprovades, representatives de l'àrdua lluita amb què es van aconseguir.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Preguntes i respostes: Expert en salvaguarda del Vaticà P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 de juny de 2021<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ. Imatge: jesuïtes australians.<br/><br/>El president del Centre per a la Protecció dels Infants de la Universitat Gregoriana de Roma i membre de la Comissió Pontifícia per a la Protecció dels Menors, P. Hans Zollner SJ, va ser a Austràlia el 2018 per parlar amb els líders del ministeri catòlic i els supervivents.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh de Jesuit Communications es va asseure amb ell durant la visita per explorar com l’Església està responent a la crisi de l’abús internacionalment, i el que es pot aprendre de les nostres experiències a Austràlia.<br/><br/>MM: Aquest és el teu tercer viatge a Austràlia. Has visitat uns quants altres països per veure com l'Església està responent als abusos a tot el món. Ens pots donar alguna idea de com és la imatge global?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: La meva comprensió, després d’haver visitat uns 50 països en cinc o sis continents, és que l’Església està començant a moure’s realment en els últims dos anys sobre la qüestió de fer justícia a les víctimes, d’escoltar-les, i fer tot el que es pugui fer en termes de salvaguarda.<br/><br/>Vaig estar amb els provincials jesuïtes de tota l’Àfrica a finals d’abril, i el President de l’Assistència Jesuïta d’Àfrica i Madagascar està molt compromès i dedicat a això. Ha elaborat un pla d’acció exhaustiu per a la formació i la introducció de directrius a tot el lloc. És un esforç molt considerat i molt deliberat fer tot el que es pugui fer per participar proactivament com a jesuïtes a l'Àfrica, en un continent on fins fa uns anys tot això era una llengua estrangera.<br/><br/>Un dels reptes d'intentar desenvolupar aquest enfocament global és que s'està tractant amb tantes cultures, i tantes comprensions diferents. Com s’agrupa tot això i s’intenta donar formació i suport a les comunitats religioses que aborden aquests temes?<br/><br/>Aquesta és una de les grans preguntes que tenim. Crec que el que puc fer és estimular la discussió, estimular la reflexió, i preparar la gent tant com sigui possible perquè puguin fer el treball de base.<br/><br/>El Centre de Protecció de la Infància de la Universitat Gregoriana no pretén tenir la resposta a totes les preguntes. No només perquè no coneixem els contextos específics, potser en coneixem alguns, sinó que estem parlant de milers de cultures, estem parlant de centenars de llengües, estem parlant de fons legals molt diversos. Fins i tot varia de vegades dins d'un país, com Austràlia, on hi ha estats dins de la Commonwealth d'Austràlia que tenen lleis diferents que altres estats.<br/><br/>Sóc algú que intenta provocar i estimular la discussió i la reflexió. També estic molt content d'escoltar la gent.<br/><br/>Vostè va esmentar la necessitat d'escoltar i donar suport a les víctimes en ser escoltats. Òbviament hem tingut la Comissió Reial aquí a Austràlia, però quines són algunes de les altres maneres que vostè ha vist que les veus de les víctimes estan sent recolzades a tot el món?<br/><br/>A França hi ha una diòcesi que ha establert el que ells anomenen 'L'Espai de l'Escolta'. Allà, les víctimes poden presentar-se i expressar-se. El bisbe és present. És un espai obert en el qual les persones que han estat ferides tremendament són lliures almenys d'expressar el que volen demanar al lideratge de l'Església, etc.<br/><br/>Hi ha altres llocs als Estats Units o en altres països on les víctimes han estat convidades per les diòcesis, per les províncies, per la direcció de l’Església. He de dir que, en general, crec que hi ha bona voluntat, i hi ha més persones com bisbes i provincials que escolten les víctimes del que sabem. Però no hi ha un únic model de donar a les víctimes no només l’espai per expressar-se i ser escoltades, sinó també per participar activament en el desenvolupament de l’Església.<br/><br/>Pel que fa a la creació d'espais de suport per a les víctimes, quines són algunes de les coses que heu vist que realment podrien ajudar - i que podríem estar considerant aquí a Austràlia?<br/><br/>Un dels punts principals que moltes víctimes plantegen és, 'No podem tenir, dins dels entorns de la parròquia, dins dels entorns de les escoles, una conversa regular que inclou supervivents d'abús com a membres regulars d'un comitè, una comissió, un tauler de ressonància, un grup de retroalimentació o alguna cosa així?' De manera que aquesta veu no només s'introdueix en una ocasió específica, o quan una persona se sent com ell o ella està en un punt per ser capaç de parlar d'ella, però [s'escolta] de forma regular - construir aquesta veu en el sistema.<br/><br/>Això ens ajudarà a tots. Ajudarà a supervivents i víctimes perquè se sentiran benvinguts i apreciats en l’experiència específica, i en els reptes específics de la vida, que van passar. En segon lloc, ajudarà a la comunitat en general, perquè almenys podem fer-nos més i més sensibles a quines són les preocupacions i necessitats específiques dels supervivents, que també poden parlar amb les necessitats dels joves.<br/><br/>M: Tenim grups forts de supervivents aquí a Austràlia que han pogut recolzar-se mútuament a través d’aquest procés. Però el que estàs dient és que necessitem alguna manera de donar suport a aquests grups, i donar suport a aquestes persones, a través de les nostres pròpies institucions també?<br/><br/>I crec que hem de ser creatius. Funcionarà per a una escola i una parròquia i una diòcesi d'una manera, i per a altres d'una altra manera. Perquè els supervivents amb els quals estic en contacte constant, tenen peticions molt similars, i experiències similars pel que fa a ser acollits a l’Església o no – sentint-se expulsats o acomiadats. Però també tenen entre si expectatives molt diferents. Així que he après que també has de ser molt propera a acceptar les diferències en el que aquest grup específic, o aquest supervivent específic, vol, sol·licita i necessita.<br/><br/>M: Els supervivents parlen de voler que les seves històries siguin escoltades i reconegudes. Hem tingut la Comissió Reial aquí a Austràlia, que va proporcionar un procés independent on les víctimes podien presentar-se. Hi ha necessitat d’alguna cosa així en termes d’un procés de veritat, justícia i reconciliació per a l’Església internacionalment?<br/><br/>H: Sí, crec que hi ha una necessitat d’això a nivell internacional. Però crec que primer cada església local ha de fer la seva pròpia tasca. No veig que passi molt aviat que s'estableixi algun consell o comissió d'aquest tipus per examinar aquesta àrea per a tota l'Església. L'Església té 1.300 milions de membres, i està present en 190 països, amb tot tipus de diferències en les expectatives pel que fa al suport psicològic, espiritual i financer.<br/><br/>Hi ha una cosa que m'he trobat constantment en comunicar-me, treballar amb les víctimes i escoltar-les, i és que volen ser escoltades. Per tant, si hi hagués la sensació que les víctimes eren escoltades constantment —a Roma i en altres llocs— crec que això donaria un gran alleujament a moltes víctimes.<br/><br/>Crec que la preocupació, especialment pel que fa a la vostra pregunta, és que les esglésies locals facin tot el possible perquè les víctimes siguin escoltades en aquest país en particular. Tinc una llista de persones que volen parlar directament amb el Sant Pare, i físicament és impossible. Vaig estar allà el 2014 per traduir per a dos supervivents alemanys que van ser triats amb dos supervivents irlandesos i dos anglesos quan va rebre els sis d'ells a casa. Va passar tot el matí escoltant-los un darrere l'altre. Per a cada un d'ells, va estar allà durant 40 o 45 minuts. Si hagués de fer això per cada supervivent que no podia dormir més.<br/><br/>El seu exemple és modelar per a tota l’Església catòlica la manera com les víctimes i els supervivents són acollits, acollits i escoltats. Penso que si els bisbes i els provincials d’aquest món, de tots els països, seguissin el seu exemple, molts supervivents serien realment agraïts per això.<br/><br/>L'arquebisbe Diarmud Martin va ser citat recentment just abans de la Trobada Mundial de les Famílies, sobre la Comissió Pontifícia, dient que és massa petita, ja que actualment està establerta per aconseguir el que necessita aconseguir. Quina és la seva opinió sobre això? L'Església ha d'invertir més recursos en com està supervisant aquestes qüestions?<br/><br/>Actualment som 16 membres de bàsicament tots els continents, i els principals grups lingüístics. Representem una varietat de disciplines i professions, i el propòsit de la comissió, com els estatuts que acaben de ser promulgats, és donar consell al Sant Pare.<br/><br/>Un malentès comú sobre la comissió és primer que tractem casos d'al·legacions. Aquest no és el cas. No tenim poder jurídic ni administratiu pel que fa als casos, perquè quan es tracta d’al·legacions d’abús es fixen els tribunals i el procediment.<br/><br/>Un segon malentès és que promovem, directament, les coses sobre el terreny. El nostre primer i primer objectiu és que aconsellem al Sant Pare sobre qüestions.<br/><br/>Per tant, des del meu punt de vista, sí, hem d’invertir més. Però hem d’invertir més a nivell local, i hem d’assegurar-nos que les propostes de la Comissió Pontifícia s’enviïn al Sant Pare –que normalment ho fa el President– i després hi ha un procés de seguiment que reflecteix el que hem donat com a consell.<br/><br/>A Austràlia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited supervisa la resposta de l'Església i proporciona directrius i suport per assegurar que totes les institucions de l'Església siguin institucions segures per als nens. És necessari algun tipus de suport organitzatiu des de Roma per a aquells bisbes i diòcesis que lluiten per formar aquestes institucions i garantir la salvaguarda en aquestes diòcesis?<br/><br/>Crec que en última instància la comissió es desenvoluparà en aquesta línia. Ara estan en el procés de contractació d'experts en aquestes àrees.<br/><br/>Crec que l’Església ha d’entendre que les esglésies locals poden aprendre les unes de les altres. I la meva comprensió sempre ha estat —i crec que el Sant Pare ens ho ha recordat— que l’Església no funcionarà com una empresa centralitzada. No funciona així, efectivament. Cada bisbe, cada conferència episcopal, té, en certa mesura, la seva vida per si mateixa. El que necessitem aprendre més és obrir canals de comunicació mútua.<br/><br/>Hi ha una sèrie de coses que la gent culpa d'abús a l'Església. Com a sacerdot i psicòleg, i com algú que s'ha reunit i treballat amb els supervivents, quines són les seves idees sobre aquest tema?<br/><br/>Crec que la qüestió d’on ve l’abús és la més important, i el Papa ho ha dirigit en la seva carta al poble de Déu publicada el 20 d’agost. Diu en el primer paràgraf, i ho repeteix una i altra vegada, que la qüestió de l’abús sexual està sempre lligada —o gairebé sempre lligada— no només a la qüestió de l’abús de poder, sinó també a l’abús de consciència.<br/><br/>Per tant, la veritable qüestió fonamental de l'abús és molt més complexa que només la qüestió de la sexualitat, ja sigui heterosexual o homosexual. És una qüestió de poder, i allà hem de treballar realment en la qüestió de com entenem el sacerdoci, com entenem el bisbat, com entenem i vivim els nostres ministeris? Quins són els límits?<br/><br/>Per això estic molt content que la Província Jesuïta d'Austràlia establisca un codi de conducta. Perquè no parlem només d'abús sexual de menors. Parlem d'abús sexual d'adults, i parlem d'abús d'altres maneres, com l'abús de consciència, on li dicteu a algú el que penseu, o fingeu saber per Déu, i podeu dir a una altra persona: "Has de fer això", contra la consciència d'aquesta persona.<br/><br/>Molta gent creu que el celibat produeix abusos. Com sempre dic, el celibat com a tal no és motiu d’abús, sinó com expliquem que el 99,9% de tots els abusadors no visquin una vida celibatària, i com expliquem que el 95% o el 96% de tots els sacerdots no abusin de menors? Però el celibat, o un vot de castedat, que no està realment integrat, que no es viu realment correctament, sí, que produeix un problema. De vegades la gent es posa a beure, de vegades es posa a jugar, i de vegades es posa a la mala conducta sexual, amb adults i amb menors.<br/><br/>La pregunta real sobre això és com tractem amb la noció de poder espiritual religiós amb què s’investeixen els sacerdots i els bisbes? Com ens pot ajudar la teologia a entendre, i potser com ens pot ajudar la sociologia, la psicologia o l’administració de negocis a definir els límits del poder, i la necessitat de mantenir els teus límits? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | No em sorprèn aquest desajust. De fet, fins i tot aniria tan lluny com per dir que això no és una cosa que mai canviarà, ni ens hauríem d'afanyar a canviar-lo. D'aquí a 10 anys, encara tindrem elements complexos a la llista de preocupacions més grans, i les coses que finalment estem arribant a entendre seran les parts principals de la nostra despesa.<br/><br/>Ara, Gunnar i Andy tenen punts excel·lents, específicament sobre els equips de TI que veuen problemes de TI i els resolen amb solucions de TI; de fet, estic positiu que els seus punts tenen mèrit.<br/><br/>Però crec que hi ha altres idees que superen aquells (vaig comentar en els seus blocs sobre això, i més tard vaig decidir que només hauria de bloc aquí). Aquestes 3 principals preocupacions són sagnantment noves tals que:<br/><br/>Tenim por de les coses noves perquè no les entenem, o no les entenem perquè són noves.<br/><br/>Són massa nous per a nosaltres per tenir enfocaments sòlids per gestionar-los.<br/><br/>són massa nous per a nosaltres per saber si hauríem d'estar preocupats o no! tendim a ser paranoics / preocupats per defecte, el que és bo!<br/><br/>massa nou per tenir elements pressupostaris obvis assignats a ells. Puc comprar una caixa o algun programari que proporcioni "seguretat al núvol" o "seguretat a les xarxes socials"?<br/><br/>són tan nous que el negoci ni tan sols sap com utilitzar-los o el que volen d'ells. I molt menys com podem assegurar-los mentre encara es compleixen o almenys no trepitjar totes les necessitats del negoci. Si el negoci ni tan sols sap com utilitzar-los encara, no estic segur que la seguretat estigui en cap posició per guiar aquest ús de manera segura.<br/><br/>També s'ha d'esmentar que aquestes noves coses s'estan empènyer en gran mesura a través de consumerland i en el negoci, amb TI com una mena de, "Oh sí," va pensar. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth són totes les respostes de TI a qüestions típicament TI. Per descomptat que hi ha una diferència. També són qüestions molt subjectives, en oposició a elements molt objectius com ara tallafocs, bits maliciosos coneguts, comportaments, signatures, ports. Els negocis presenten qüestions molt complexes que sovint impliquen persones (que no podem corregir) i que sovint no encaixen bé en les regles generals. Fins i tot si ens allunyem de les solucions tècniques i dediquem el nostre temps a resoldre aquests problemes, encara no es resoldran ordenadament. De la mateixa manera, quan l'empenta arriba a empènyer, pot tenir i complir objectius amb tallafocs? Pot mostrar millora? Tot això flueix de l'aspecte no tècnic bastant subjectiu d'aquests temes. Una mena de la diferència entre la targeta d'informe d'un nen i la retroalimentació que obteniu d'una conferència de pares i mestres. Si teniu un fill, quin seria més propens a estar en desacord o no necessàriament creure? (La resposta és la subjectiva!)<br/><br/>Podríem dir que aquesta és la progressió natural de la seguretat i la tecnologia: des d’apuntar els controls tècnics fins a pujar la pila cap al comportament i les persones. Per descomptat, aquestes 3 principals preocupacions es poden dir per perforar a través de tallafocs i segments de xarxa, però aquesta és la naturalesa d'aquestes coses (mitjanes socials "punxar" a través d'un tallafoc és molt diferent de punxar a través d'una connexió SSH per connectar la meva xarxa domèstica; mitjans socials és similar a la * manera * * Utilitzo la meva connex SSH després de la reten ja està perforat perquè és necessari; és el port 80.<br/><br/>Bàsicament, totes les indicacions apunten a no ser sorpresos per aquesta dicotomia. I no crec que això sigui una altra indicació que IT / seguretat està fent malament, o no està alineat adequadament amb els negocis, o té un fons tècnic de sala fosca. No estic dient que estem fent les coses bé o que estem correctament alineats, però l'anterior no és un bon argument per donar suport a la teoria d'aquestes deficiències.<br/><br/>Ara, per a un salt realment gran, m'agradaria que l'augment actual de la informàtica mòbil fos tan gran com la introducció d'ordinadors als negocis i, més tard, el PC / Internet als negocis. Ara, jo no estava al voltant quan el primer va passar, ni estava en la indústria quan la revolució de l'ordinador personal va entrar en els negocis, però m'apostaria que és la comparació més propera fins ara. Fins i tot puc dir el mateix per a les xarxes socials. Aquests són maleïts nous i són grans canvis més enllà de només portar en Macs o nou programari o algun nou procés de negoci. |
