| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch a través dels temps<br/><br/>Estava remenant alguns objectes relacionats amb el quidditch, com ara escombres i mossegades i tot el que sigui, i es va convertir en una compilació estranya de coses, inclòs en Harry, allà a baix. No estic del tot satisfet amb la forma en què va sortir, però com que no és dolent per a la meva segona foto de fan art de Harry Potter, vaig decidir pintar-la de totes maneres. Si us esteu preguntant on és la seva cicatriu, és allà, però és molt, molt lleugera i petita perquè ho vaig fer a l'ordinador. Dibuixat en ploma, acolorit en pintura. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Acabo de començar a pescar amb mosca d'aigua salada aquest estiu i necessito un nou rodet, així que sens dubte serà el Kraken.

També estic tractant d'esbrinar una manera d'explicar a Ella-qui-ha de-ser-obedient que necessitaré comprar una nova vareta digna d'aquest rodet ....<br/><br/>Sempre he trobat que cap explicació és la millor explicació.

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Si vas ser admès i matriculat -> sí Si vas ser admès i vas assistir a una altra escola -> sí Si vas prendre cursos d'extensió (fins i tot els tenen allà? Sé que UCLA ho fa) -> sí Si vas anar a l'escola de postgrau allà -> sí<br/><br/>Aquesta és la meva interpretació perquè qualsevol d'aquests escenaris compliria o bé ser "admès a un programa de pregrau" o "prenent cursos" a la UC Berkeley. Podria estar completament equivocat, però, està millor només trucar-los i aclarir la seva situació específica.<br/><br/>La meva opinió: Basant-me en la formulació, ho he interpretat com preguntar-li si va ser admès a la universitat de Berkeley, si va optar per assistir-hi o no. Si volgués dir admès i assistit, podrien haver-ho vist fàcilment a través de la part "Institucions Undergrad" de la sol·licitud. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | Molts dels cargols de capçal de temps s'ajusten a l'angle, de manera que els configureu a diguem 20Nm per a un punt de partida i l'angle els estrènyer des d'allà.<br/><br/>Hauria preferit un martell més gran.<br/><br/>Salutacions.<br/><br/>Mai pots tenir un martell massa gran<br/><br/>T'ho confesso.<br/>Ha d'haver una distinció fina entre l'ajust de parell amb una clau de parell de clic i l'ajust d'angle, però fins i tot com a enginyer, realment no ho entenc.<br/><br/>Per a mi, si estrènyer un cargol s'arriba a un punt quan es bloqueja.

Després d'això, més estrènyer tant augmenta la càrrega de parell i l'angle del cap ??<br/><br/>Per a mi és una distinció entre les tècniques de mesura més aviat que el resultat final. Si algú pot explicar per què un en lloc de l'altre seria genial ??<br/><br/>Estic segur que altres pets vells recordaran les claus de parell d'estil antic amb el punter separat que oscil·lava al voltant d'una escala graduada a mesura que es posa càrrega en ells.<br/>Graduat en Ft Lbs, mesura en angle.<br/>No és una variació del tema?? |
| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Protecció d'hivern per a les figueres<br/><br/>Informar d'aquest article<br/><br/>Protecció d'hivern per a les figueres<br/><br/>Preguntes Freqüents - FAQ<br/><br/>La figuera ha existit des d'almenys 5.000 aC, i es cultiva a tot el món per la seva deliciosa fruita. Les figues creixen bé en un clima suau sense climes extrems. La figuera es propaga ara en algunes zones amb hiverns severs. Es requereixen precaucions de protecció per salvar l'arbre dels danys de l'hivern.<br/><br/>Arbres de figues en pot<br/><br/>Les figueres ornamentals en olla poden suportar una mica de congelació i no requereixen llum una vegada que entren en la fase de latencia hivernal. Evitar oscil·lacions extremes de temperatura col·locant la figuera en un ambient controlat com un garatge, on les temperatures oscil·len entre lleugerament sota congelació i lleugerament per sobre. La planta s'ha de regar a mesura que el sòl s'asseca.<br/><br/>Blindatge<br/><br/>Es requereix blindatge per protegir l'arbre del clima hivernal més extrem. Les figueres requereixen col·locació en zones del sòl on el sòl no es congela per protegir-lo de malalties i augmentar les seves possibilitats de supervivència a l'hivern. Grans pantalles col·locades al voltant de l'arbre el protegeixen dels vents hivernals que poden danyar i congelar la fusta.<br/><br/>Embolcall<br/><br/>L'embolcall de l'arbre protegeix l'arbre del fred i evita que els vents forts destrueixin les branques. L'embolcall de figuera s'ha d'aplicar una vegada que les fulles de l'arbre han caigut per evitar que les fulles es podreixin dins del material d'embolcall. Les figueres són sensibles a lleugers canvis de temperatura. No pot escalfar-se dins de la pel·lícula protectora o bé l'arbre pot començar a créixer, fent-lo susceptible a danys greus durant l'esclat fred.<br/><br/>Plantació<br/><br/>Les pràctiques de cultiu ajuden a protegir la figuera durant els hiverns durs. Les varietats que són resistents al fred són millors per a llocs on els temps són durs. La Turquia marró, Brunswick i Blue Celeste són bons cultivars per al fred. La plantació s'ha de fer contra una paret o estructura que irradiï calor cap a l'arbre durant els mesos d'hivern.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Les arrels de la figuera requereixen sòl sec durant el període de latencia hivernal. El reg només s'ha de fer quan el sòl està sec i les arrels s'han de protegir de la fusió de la neu i la pluja. La protecció col·locada a terra sota l'arbre, a prop del tronc -per evitar que l'aigua es drena al sòl- protegeix l'arbre dels danys.<br/><br/>Paraules clau:<br/>protecció de figuera, hivern de figuera, cura de figuera |
| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | CEO d'Oculus cau dur en el suport de Mac per al Rift<br/><br/>CEO d'Oculus, Palmer Luckey, no ha retallat les seves paraules quan se li va preguntar en una entrevista si els auriculars Rift VR mai donarà suport a la Mac. Si teniu alguna esperança de que sigui aviat, és possible que vulgueu preparar-vos per a alguna decepció.<br/><br/>Això depèn d'Apple. Si alguna vegada alliberen un bon ordinador, ho farem.<br/><br/>El que s'està referint allà en un sentit menys diplomàtic són els gràfics discrets necessaris per executar el Rift. La veritat simple és que Apple simplement no va per a gràfics d'alta gamma que compleixin els requisits per als auriculars. Per context, en un PC amb Windows, es necessita un mínim d'una NVIDIA GTX 970, una targeta gràfica de 300 dòlars.<br/><br/>Com va dir Lucky:<br/><br/>Simplement es redueix al fet que Apple no prioritza les GPU d'alta gamma. Podeu comprar un Mac Pro de $ 6,000 amb la part superior de la línia AMD FirePro D700, i encara no coincideix amb les nostres especificacions recomanades. Així que si prioritzen les GPU de gamma alta com solien fer durant un temps en el dia, ens encantaria donar suport a Mac. Però ara mateix, no hi ha una sola màquina que ho faci.<br/><br/>El Mac Pro no es pot acusar de no tenir molta potència, perquè sí, però igualment els gràfics FirePro estan dirigits més al mercat creatiu, igual que el Mac Pro. El Mac Pro, en particular, supera de lluny altres requisits de maquinari, però naturalment, com que el Rift és un gràfic pesat, aquí és on hi ha la manca. Luckey és potser una mica per sobre de la part superior, però igualment ell és l'home darrere de la Escletxa, així que no hi ha dubtes de molta veritat al que diu. Fins i tot si no ho diu particularment bé.<br/><br/>Què en penseu, propietaris de Mac del món? Fins i tot us preocupeu per l'Oculus Rift o és alguna cosa que us agradaria que poguéssiu tenir? Soneu als comentaris de sota!<br/><br/>Comentaris dels lectors<br/><br/>CEO d'Oculus cau dur en el suport de Mac per al Rift<br/><br/>No, no es molesta per això, ja que realment no estava planejant comprar un Oculus Rift. Per a mi, la categoria de producte encara és massa aviat i massa en una fase beta-kinda. Però augmenta un punt vàlid. Apple hauria de tractar d'aconseguir més endavant del paquet CPU / GPU sa. Ara mateix sempre estan enrere.<br/><br/>Disculpeu-me, però què és HTC Vive millor? I Oculus Rift sens dubte dóna suport a les màquines Linux que compleixen les seves especificacions de maquinari! (El problema no és el sistema operatiu, sinó el maquinari.)<br/><br/>A més, mireu PER QUÈ el HTC Vive suporta OS X: inclou més del seu propi maquinari. (Per això costa tant.) Les solucions Oculus, tant el Rift com el Samsung Gear VR, requereixen el maquinari al qual s'està connectant per realitzar més de l'aixecament pesat.<br/><br/>VR no és un truc. Els televisors 3D no sempre donen tant d'un efecte 3d, i no funciona amb tothom. La VR funciona amb tothom, i els productes de llançament oficial d'Oculus i HTC Vive gairebé no tenen latència, de manera que no hi ha cap mareig de moviment. També hi ha un gran suport de joc.<br/><br/>Òbviament, si els jocs són una prioritat, generalment no estàs en el mercat per a un Mac, però. No molts desenvolupadors de jocs admeten OSX, de manera que aquest tipus de dispositius probablement tenen un ús limitat en un Mac (per als jocs, de totes maneres, per al qual va ser dissenyat el Rift). Almenys aquesta és l'única raó per la qual em podia veure utilitzant un. Definitivament no l'utilitzaria per veure pel·lícules.<br/><br/>Apple va implementar el motor Metall a El Capitan, podria haver-hi algun pla per entrar al mercat dels jocs (com Apple va aprendre d'iOS el gran que és aquest mercat, només cal mirar les aplicacions més recaptades).<br/>Així que ara falta el maquinari i els desenvolupadors de jocs probablement mostrarien algun interès, ja que els Mac ara hi ha una quantitat acceptable d'usuaris de Mac a tot el món.<br/><br/>M'agradaria veure Apple fer el seu camí en aquest sector de la indústria. No utilitzo cap producte d'Apple actualment, però estan fent molts dels moviments correctes en moltes àrees i estic molt intrigat.<br/><br/>A més, la competència alimenta la innovació. Sé que la major part dels fabricants d'ordinadors ja creen aquesta competència, però Apple té la força de voluntat RnD i els diners per girar cap realment. Pot ser que no guanyin els jocs de números en termes d'especificacions, en realitat rarament ho fan, però la majoria de les persones que es preocupen per fer la investigació saben que el rendiment != la suma de les parts del dispositiu. Apple pot fer més amb "menys". En el paper, els seus productes semblen inferiors, però quan el maquinari acuradament equilibrat compleix amb el programari específicament dissenyat, generalment funcionen igual de bé que la competència si no ho fa.<br/><br/>HA! M'encanta com, de sobte, tenir un ordinador d'alt rendiment no és important per als fans d'Apple! No hi ha un sol Mac capaç dels gràfics més alts. No es pot comprar un, no es pot construir un. Mac no és capaç de ser el més alt en el rendiment i vostè és bo amb això. HA! Clàssic!<br/><br/>Vaig comprar el meu MacBook Pro Retina en 2012 a causa de la pantalla d'alta resolució i la GPU no discreta. No obstant això, per al meu escriptori vaig construir un sistema amb un monitor 4K, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU, i 16 GB de memòria tot per menys del que pagaria per un iMac. Fins i tot tinc un SSD configurat per arrencar en OSX. El meu punt és que Apple podria fer coses similars si ho desitjava, però no ho fa. De fet, mira l'iMac més recent. Inclou gràfics discrets i una unitat lenta de 5400 RPM. El meu ordinador pot no semblar tan bonic, i no és tan prim, però al final és més útil - no és per això que comprem un ordinador en primer lloc?<br/><br/>No veig per què un Mac pro no pot fer ús de l'Oculus no està construït per a la representació de vídeo. Entenc que no serà capaç d'executar en iMac i per això l'Oculus ha de ser marca per als usuaris Pro a causa dels requisits i vénen al preu.<br/><br/>Ara la gent està dient que el seu ordinador està fent tot l'aixecament pesat, així que per què és el punt de preu sobre $ 800 per alguna cosa que no està fent res?<br/><br/>Estic entusiasmat amb la direcció de VR, però no on està en aquest moment.<br/><br/>La seva posició (que és la seva) no ha estat mai una posició defensiva. És $ 800 a causa del que fa la pantalla; Angle de visió de 110 ° (encara no ull humà, però molt més a prop que altres pantalles) amb una latència molt baixa per reduir o eliminar la malaltia del moviment en una pantalla de 1200x1800 per ull per a la qualitat HD.<br/><br/>I sí, Mac's són molt àmpliament utilitzats per a la representació de vídeo, però que la representació no passa a 30 + fps. Pot trigar hores de rendiment de vídeo màquines per representar un sol marc i de vegades anys per representar una pel·lícula sencera. Els productes finals, o material pre-renderitzat, és el que llavors es converteix en 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Gràcies @TheRealFixxer<br/>Molt del que dius té sentit i alguns no ho sabia.<br/><br/>Suposo que no veig VR com un joc, però com una immersió i veure Mac's són bons en 3dcad i la compilació de vídeo que pensaria que serien capaços de compilar una escena bé. Fins i tot he vist renders 3d de pel·lícula caminar a través. Crear un món 3D i col·locar càmeres a les zones per esbrinar com es veuria una escena<br/><br/>Però estic d'acord Mac's fer més ús de cicles de la CPU fins i tot utilitzant allà GPU's per ajudar. Amb això va dir que hi ha altres direccions es podria prendre. Com targetes de vídeo llamp extern.<br/><br/>La meva gran adherència és el fet que Octulas es veu com un producte de consum. Si els requisits són tan alts, llavors és més un producte professional i s'ha d'anunciar com a tal. Entenc que la tecnologia hi és, però no crec que hi sigui per anomenar-la producte de consum.<br/><br/>Sí, tens raó. Apple també té problemes amb el programari. La majoria no estan utilitzant "metal" el llenguatge de programació d'Apple que accelera el processament per als jocs perquè és una solució única d'Apple on molts utilitzen motors de joc que funcionen en Microsoft Direct X o Opengl de codi obert que la majoria dels jocs utilitzen per executar en Linux i oSX. Opengl és al voltant d'un 20% més lent i en algun moment molt més que això en comparació amb Direct x, de manera que una targeta de joc superior de la línia que s'executa en oSX corre tan ràpid com una targeta de joc de nivell mitjà a les finestres. Per tant, els grans problemes, per no parlar de la majoria de macs han construït en targetes que no tenen cap possibilitat d'actualització.<br/><br/>El mac pro és tan diferent que Apple hauria de fer això, ja que no valdria la pena un venedor de targetes fent això, ja que no hi ha beneficis per a ells amb la petita quantitat de possibles compradors que hi hauria per a això. Apple no li agrada perdre diners pel que no veig que això passi mai. Apple perdria diners oferint actualitzacions de targetes de vídeo per a professionals de mac.<br/><br/>Bé, té un punt encara que no m'importa oculus rift, més aviat esperar a starVR. Hauria d'haver una opció per afegir millors GPUs en un iMac i MacBook Pro. També és trist que ja no hi hagi targeta nVidia, m'ha agradat el suport CUDA ara hauré de comprar un PC i instal·lar Linux per als meus projectes CUDA.<br/><br/>Els jocs són un mercat en creixement i no passarà molt de temps fins i tot els iPhones tenen més rendiment de la GPU que els Mac. Estic d'acord que Apple hauria d'oferir una GPU d'alta gamma en un Mac<br/><br/>Estic molt molest per la manca de gràfics discrets d'alt rendiment en ordinadors Mac. Fins i tot la part superior de l'iMac com utilitza una GPU mòbil obsoleta que, per descomptat, no es pot actualitzar. Si vull desenvolupar programari per a VR, Apple m'ha deixat cap altra opció que comprar o construir un PC per executar-lo. Com un gran fan d'Apple (sí ho admeto) això em fa bastant trist.<br/><br/>BTW, VR no és una moda passatgera. Si ho has provat saps el que vull dir. VR canviarà els jocs i la creació de continguts per sempre. La meva única preocupació sobre VR és que és massa bo. Hi podria haver milions de persones que es convertiran en addictes a viure i jugar en mons virtuals. Mireu quantes persones es van convertir en addictes als MMO que jugaven en una pantalla plana. Amb VR realment se sent com si estigués en el joc.<br/><br/>No es preocupi per res, estic bastant segur que Apple tindrà la seva pròpia implementació per a Mac i iOS quan la tecnologia estigui a punt per als consumidors, ara mateix és més per als usuaris més durs. Com sempre a la poma li agrada cronometrar la seva presència en el moment adequat, amb el producte adequat. Tingueu fe en la poma.<br/><br/>És curiós que molta gent sàpiga quin vr és millor basat en el suport os. Suposo que vostès van fer proves pesades i ara són el tipus a la gran botiga electrònica que sap millor.<br/><br/>HTC va dir que donarà suport a l'osx, però això encara s'ha de veure.<br/><br/>Entenc que molts de vostès estan estampats en allà d**k. Però entenguin que Apple està més centrat en ordinadors portàtils. I ordinadors portàtils no es poden embalar amb més potència que un PC, a causa de la mida, la calor, el consum d'energia, etc.<br/><br/>Té raó, tot i que ho va posar en termes de ****. M'encanta el meu Mac, però Senyor necessita un impuls en els gràfics. No és que hagi de costar més, però jo estaria més que disposat a pagar una mica més per una millor targeta gràfica o almenys tenir l'opció d'instal·lar la meva pròpia. És realment una llàstima que aquest tipus hagi de fer que la seva declaració soni com si simplement no estigués educat. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | La masia en el paisatge americà: drets cívics<br/><br/>Els estudiants de dotze grau examinen i expliquen els drets legals dissenyats per protegir la llibertat religiosa. Avaluen fins a quin punt la Primera Esmena protegeix les pràctiques religioses. Investiguen i descriuen les batalles legals actuals i passats sobre la zonificació religiosa i els edificis.

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | El que diuen els 19<br/><br/>No, és perquè els productors d’entreteniment i els comercialitzadors de productes volen actors / actrius i models que s’assemblin a la majoria de l’audiència, perquè siguin eines de venda relacionables i, per tant, més efectives. Estic segur que les dones asiàtiques es veuen meravelloses als homes asiàtics. Per a mi, com a home blanc, tenen apel·lació zero.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Sóc 100% recte. No vaig fora de la meva carrera. Quan era soldat vaig tenir l'experiència "t'estimo molt de temps" a Àsia. Això m'ha deixat sentir incòmode quan hi ha dones asiàtiques a prop meu. De vegades em sento profundament incòmode, tot i que els individus particulars no han fet res per merèixer-ho. Durant una visita a Tailàndia, em vaig adonar que l'única manera d'evitar ser proposat al carrer era portar una dona blanca amb mi com a cuidador.<br/><br/>Ah, la cosa és que no hi ha molta gent blanca (o qualsevol en absolut) a la Xina, però en llocs "blancs", (o almenys Austràlia) hi ha bastant d'asiàtics al voltant d'allà, el que em va fer pensar en aquesta pregunta ...<br/><br/>Potser en parts del país on et quedes (recorda, ocells d’una ploma...), igual que als republicans sembla que la majoria de la gent són republicans, etc. Mentre que només pot ser una petita minoria que t’envolta.<br/><br/>I pel que sé, hi ha un munt de blancs a la Xina, principalment per negocis, etc. Però és simple, la majoria de les persones hi són asiàtiques, de manera que prefereixen les nenes asiàtiques (gossos com gossos, gats com gats, la majoria de la gent prefereix la seva pròpia mena). I no hi ha res de dolent en això. El mateix passa als països blancs.<br/><br/>Crec que els asiàtics són els més bells. Per desgràcia per a mi el 2 que em vaig involucrar en la meva vida un em estava utilitzant per al meu lloc / internet fa molt de temps i el recent va ser una puta estúpida excavació d'or. Ella mai es va graduar a la universitat i tenia 30 anys. M'agradaria molt si vaig conèixer una dona asiàtica bonica intel·ligent prop de la meva edat que no era un cercador d'or.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic sí, perquè quan un home estima profundament que sempre bona amb vostè al llit no importa la mida dels pits o el color de la pell i un home real sempre respectar una noia en totes les relacions com mare, germana, dona, nòvia, etc<br/><br/>com a model des de la infància vaig començar amb una empresa anomenada sucre i espècies. Vaig ser reclutat al Japó mentre la meva família estava estacionada allà.<br/><br/>aconsegueixes una feina perquè busquen una determinada mirada, a qui es dirigeixen i a l'àrea on vius.<br/><br/>Vaig haver de deixar la indústria l'any passat per raons de salut. Vaig treballar amb molts tipus de persones, coreans, japonesos, xinesos, polonesos, alemanys, americans, espanyols, àrabs. He treballat amb nens, adults, adolescents de totes aquestes ètnies.<br/><br/>Sóc meitat blanc meitat nadius americans (Lakota) així que els va encantar la meva mirada des d'una edat jove. però hi ha molts estàndards de bellesa en la indústria i no tots són tan retratats, alguns es fan per semblar pitjor, i alguns no es prenen prou seriosament ...<br/><br/>No, és perquè els homes asiàtics estan gelosos i enfadats i inventar milers d'excuses cada vegada que tenen dones asiàtiques en els mitjans de comunicació perquè estan gelosos de les dones asiàtiques, i els nord-americans volen mantenir l'estatus de dones blanques, és per això que les parelles entre dones asiàtiques i homes blancs són boicotejats i tota la resta de la raça amb les dones blanques són ofens. Cal entendre l'enginyeria social política nord-americana al llarg d'aquests anys de mitjans de comunicació, demòcrates, política i propaganda.<br/><br/>De totes maneres, en països com Xina, Japó, Corea només tenen homes asiàtics i dones asiàtiques i les úniques excepcions són quan importen una dona blanca per fer una escena de fantasia per a ells, però no és tant, està prohibit exposar l'odi i la gelosia d'alguns homes asiàtics.<br/><br/>Els nois asiàtics estaran feliços si dius alguna cosa contra altres homes, però estaran enfadats si dius que la noia asiàtica morirà per la noia rossa, l'atractiu noi caucàsic / blanc, intentaran forçar les dones asiàtiques a fer qualsevol cosa contra aquests homes a aquest petit grup vocal d'homes asiàtics se senten millor en el seu odi, excuses, racisme i gelosiatisme. És per això que les dones asiàtiques no es mostren tant, és perquè els homes asiàtics estaran enfadats, és perquè les dones blanques no poden ser reemplaçades, i la propaganda nord-americana està al voltant de dones blanques amb homes blancs, dones blanques amb una altra raça, dones blanques contra homes blancs per a l'altra raça d'homes, dones blanques en tot.<br/><br/>Preguntes Freqüents<br/><br/>Preguntes Freqüents - FAQ<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinió Propietari<br/><br/>1 mes<br/><br/>Totes les excuses dels mitjans de comunicació i la propaganda i totes les mentides per al racisme, la gelosia i l'odi no són usades contra les dones blanques pels mateixos homes que inventen les excuses, les dones blanques tot el temps als mitjans de comunicació, entenen, l'enginyeria social americana és feta per demòcrates, els demòcrates odien els homes blancs, i les parelles més populars són els homes blancs i les dones asiàtiques. És un problema polític nord-americà.<br/><br/>Crec que és una opressió contra l'ego dels homes d'una altra raça, així que els homes blancs han de semblar dolents, ser alguna mena de broma, ser suaus, mentre que les escenes amb dones blanques i altres races és el contrari de les escenes d'homes blancs i dones no blanques |
