| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - A través de la Bíblia C2000 SèrieVoldrem al llibre dels Fets, capítol un, quan comencem el nostre estudi de l'església primitiva.<br/>Lluc, l'autor del llibre dels Fets, un company de l'apòstol Pau, que també va ser autor de l'Evangeli segons Lluc, va escriure aquests dos tractats a un amic, Teòfil. Teòfil és un nom grec. És un nom que té un significat bonic. El nom significa estimador de Déu. Hi ha alguns que creuen que no era un home en absolut, però que l'evangeli i el llibre dels Fets van ser dirigits als amants de Déu, sigui qui sigui. Hi ha altres tradicions que diuen que Teòfil era en realitat el mestre de Lluc. Que en aquells dies els metges eren esclaus, normalment l'esclau d'un patró ric. Així que el mestre de Lluc era Teòfil, i va alliberar Lluc per estar amb Pau en els viatges missioners. Així, Lluc està escrivint de nou al seu antic mestre. Aquesta és una tradició primerenca de l'església, però és, per descomptat, impossible de demostrar, com tantes de les tradicions.<br/>També hi ha qui creu que quan Pau era a Tròada, va tenir una visió d'un home que el cridava dient-li: "Vine a Macedònia i ajuda'ns", i que aquell home de la visió de Pau no era altre que Lluc. Perquè el primer que Pau va conèixer realment quan va arribar a Macedònia va ser Lluc. I com que estem en el llibre dels Fets, trobareu que quan arribem a aquesta part del llibre dels Fets, Lluc comença a escriure més en primera persona que en tercera persona. Així és, evidentment, en aquest punt particular en els Fets dels Apòstols que Lluc es va convertir en un company de Pau i va començar a viatjar amb ell. Va començar a utilitzar els pronoms "nosaltres" i "nosaltres" en lloc de "ells" i "ells". Això és, sens dubte, on Luke es va convertir en un participant i un testimoni ocular d'aquelles coses que estaven passant a partir d'aquest punt. Anem a portar això a vostè quan arribem a aquest punt.<br/>Comença els Fets dels Apòstols lligant-lo amb l'Evangeli segons Lluc. És interessant que l'última cosa que Lluc registra en el seu evangeli és la primera cosa que registra en els Fets dels Apòstols. Trobem l'evangeli de Lluc tancant com Jesús està dient als seus deixebles a esperar a Jerusalem fins que siguin revestits amb poder des de dalt. I llavors Jesús va pujar al cel, i així tanca l'evangeli. En obrir els Fets dels Apòstols, escriu,<br/>El primer tractat [és a dir, l'Evangeli segons Lluc,] t'he escrit, Teòfil, de tot el que Jesús va començar a fer i ensenyar (Actes 1:1 ),<br/>La paraula clau s'inicia. L'Evangeli segons Lluc no és la història completa del ministeri de Jesucrist. És només el començament del ministeri de Jesucrist. Jesús continua atenent a les necessitats de les persones. Jesús continua guarint els malalts. Jesús continua ressuscitant els morts. Jesús continua predicant el seu amor i el seu evangeli al món, només que ara està predicant a través d'aquells deixebles que han estat ungits amb el seu Esperit Sant. Però el ministeri de Crist continua; bàsicament, és la premissa que Lluc pren en els Fets dels Apòstols. L'antic tractat de tot el que Jesús va començar, tant per fer com per ensenyar.<br/>Per això, els Fets dels Apòstols són un llibre inacabat: perquè el Senyor continua treballant avui a través de la vida d’aquells que s’han dedicat a ser instruments de Déu. Per ser conduït i guiat i ungit pel seu Esperit Sant, per continuar el ministeri de Jesús en el món d'avui. Ara Déu ha ordenat que la seva obra s'ha de dur a terme a través d'instruments humans. No dic que s'ha de dur a terme. Déu pot utilitzar éssers àngelics per a la seva obra, i vindrà un temps, durant el llibre de l'Apocalipsi, quan Déu utilitzarà àngels per proclamar el seu evangeli a la gent de tot el món. Apocalipsi, capítol 14, "El primer àngel que vola pel mig del cel té l'evangeli etern" ( Ap 14:6 ). Però en el moment present, Déu ha triat utilitzar instruments humans. Per imperfectes que siguin, però això és el que Déu ha ordenat utilitzar. El més emocionant d'això és, Déu em farà servir i Déu us farà servir. Moltes vegades, estem suplicant, "Senyor, no puc parlar. Mai he estat capaç de parlar abans o fins i tot ara, Senyor." Com Moisès va tractar de suplicar la crida de Déu. Jeremies va dir: "Senyor, sóc només un nen; ningú no m'escoltarà." I tots tenim les nostres excuses per què no podem ser utilitzats. No? Tots sabem les raons per les quals Déu no ens podria utilitzar.<br/>Una vegada, mentre el Senyor cridava un profeta per fer la seva obra, va dir: "Senyor, envia a qui vulguis." El Senyor va dir: "Escolta, t'he cridat." "Senyor, bona idea; envia a qui vulguis." Sovint ens trobem en aquesta posició: "Senyor, envia per la mà de qui vulguis, qualsevol que no sigui jo, Senyor." I, no obstant això, Déu ha ordenat que ens utilitzem.<br/>Ara, cada un de nosaltres pot mostrar les nostres pròpies imperfeccions. Cadascú de nosaltres pot assenyalar les nostres pròpies incapacitats, i tots podem trobar una excusa per què Déu no vol utilitzar-me. Però no obstant això, Déu ha triat utilitzar-vos. Que a través de la seva vida Ell podria revelar-se a un món necessitat. Et preguntes quan Déu té aquests instruments per utilitzar com mai va aconseguir la feina feta, no?<br/>Fins al dia que va ser endut, després d'haver donat per l'Esperit Sant manaments als apòstols que havia escollit (Actes 1: 2):<br/>Això és el que va acabar amb l'Evangeli de Lluc. El dia que Jesús va ser endut, després d'haver dit als apòstols a esperar la investidura de poder.<br/>Als quals també se'ls va mostrar viu després de la seva passió, amb moltes proves infal·libles.<br/>És difícil negar el fet de la resurrecció de Jesucrist. Em vaig divertir, així com molesta i irritada, per un article que vaig llegir en el Registre de Santa Ana aquest dissabte passat. De la ciència de la creació i les teories evolutives que es presenten a les escoles del comtat. Com que, aquest professor va dir que ensenya una classe de ciència, i per tant, tracten només en fets, i que no tenen lloc per a les teories. Perquè la ciència es basa en fets i la creació es basa en supersticions religioses. Es necessita molta fe per creure les teories religioses. Quan es tracta de fets, només pot acceptar-los. Vaig pensar, "Molt interessant en aquesta classe de ciències, em van ensenyar que era un fet que el món tenia quatre mil milions d'anys. Ara estan ensenyant que és un fet que el món té dotze mil milions d'anys. No fa molt de temps que vaig anar a l’escola”.<br/>És interessant que la Bíblia mai ha necessitat ser revisada o actualitzada per satisfer les dades actuals que els homes han descobert. I, no obstant això, si agafeu els meus llibres de ciències de l'institut avui i intenteu ensenyar-los una classe de ciències, trobareu que moltes de les coses que s'ensenyaven com a fets científics quan jo era a l'institut ja no són reconegudes com a fets científics. El protoplasma cel·lular simple ja no és una cèl·lula simple, sinó extremadament complexa. Si hi ha algun fet que es pugui atestar en la història és el fet de la resurrecció de Jesucrist d'entre els morts.<br/>Tenim un sistema de jurisprudència que es basa en el testimoniatge dels testimonis. Si un home és acusat d'un delicte i hi ha persones que van ser testimonis d'aquest delicte mentre s'estava cometent, i són portats a la norma, i juren dir la veritat, tota la veritat, i res més que la veritat, que Déu els ajudi. I en els seus interrogatoris afirmen que: "Vaig veure aquest home al banc el dia vint-i-tres de maig. El vaig veure treure una pistola del seu abric. El vaig sentir demanar que se li donés tots els diners. El vaig veure quan va sortir del banc. Jo el vaig veure com l'oficial el va detenir fora." I si pots aconseguir que tres o quatre testimonis apuntin a aquest home i guardar el seu testimoni sota interrogatori, que l'home és jutjat culpable. Ell és l'únic que ho va fer. Tenim dos o tres testimonis que estan testificant la mateixa història sobre aquest home, i s'accepta com a fet que ell és el que va perpetrar el crim i és culpable. Teniu testimonis que han jurat dir la veritat que estan verificant.<br/>Després de la mort de Jesús, quan va ressuscitar, es va aparèixer a moltes persones diferents que van donar testimoni jurat que l'havien vist, que parlaven amb ell, que se'ls va aparèixer en diversos llocs en diferents circumstàncies. I durant un període de quaranta dies va visitar amb ells. I en un moment, fins a cinc-cents persones que es van reunir en un sol lloc, es va aparèixer. És difícil simplement rebutjar o negar el testimoni d'aquesta gent. Per tant, cal desacreditar tot el nostre sistema jurídic. Però no només això, aquests homes que van testimoniar que van veure el Senyor ressuscitat, que van parlar amb ell, que van menjar amb ell, tots ells, amb l'excepció d'un, es van trobar amb morts violentes a mans d'altres persones perquè van afirmar que la història que van explicar era certa. Parles de testimonis que van jurar dir la veritat, tota la veritat, res més que la veritat. Si la vida d'una persona fos amenaçada per aquest testimoni, i fos una mentida, almenys un d'ells s'hauria trencat sota la pressió. Haurien confessat tot l'engany. "Es va mostrar viu després de la seva passió per moltes proves infal·libles."<br/>Els veié durant quaranta dies i els va parlar del Regne de Déu (Ac 1,3).<br/>De vegades culpem els deixebles a causa de les seves preguntes sobre el moment del regne de Déu. Que es recordi que el regne de Déu era el tema favorit de Jesucrist. Sempre estava parlant del regne de Déu, i és una gran esperança que ell estava plantant en el cor de tots els homes. Les coses no sempre van a continuar corruptes com són. El món no anirà per sempre sota el poder de les tenebres, sota l'esclavitud del mal. Déu va a establir un dia el seu regne a la terra. Un regne d'alegria i pau justa. "Jesús regnarà, on abans que el sol faci els seus viatges successius. I el seu regne s'estén de costa a costa." I aquell dia serà el dia més gloriós que el món ha vist mai, com la malaltia i el sofriment i el dolor seran abolits en el seu regne. Com el pecat i la cobdícia i aquestes coses que han fet el món un lloc tan intolerable seran abolits en el seu regne. El comercialisme ateu, l'explotació de l'home, totes aquestes coses abolides en el seu regne gloriós quan regnà. No és d'estranyar que els deixebles estaven ansiosos per aconseguir-ho. Estic ansiosos per aconseguir-ho; Estic ansiosos perquè el seu regne vingui. I Jesús ens va dir quan preguem, la primera petició és: "Vingui el teu regne. Que es faci la teva voluntat a la terra, com al cel" (Mt 6:10 ). Aquest és el tipus correcte d'un desig que tots hauríem de tenir. Desitjo el regne de Déu. I així els parlava, durant aquell període de quaranta dies, del regne.<br/>I, reunit amb ells, els va manar que no se n'anés de Jerusalem, sinó que esperessin la promesa del Pare, que, diu ell, heu sentit parlar de mi (Ac 1,4).<br/>Ell els digué: «Mireu, espereu aquí a Jerusalem fins que rebeu la promesa del Pare». Aquesta promesa a la qual es refereix és, sens dubte, la promesa en Joel, on el Senyor va prometre, "I succeirà en els darrers dies, diu el Senyor, que jo abocaré el meu Esperit sobre tota carn, i els vostres fills i filles profetitzaran, i els vostres joves somniaran somnis, els vostres vells veuran visions, i sobre els meus servents i les meves, diu: La promesa del Pare: arribarà el dia en què Déu abocarà el seu Esperit sobre tota carn, tots els creients. Cadascú rebrà aquesta dinàmica de Déu.<br/>Perquè Joan realment va batejar amb aigua, però vosaltres sereu batejats amb l'Esperit Sant d'aquí a pocs dies (Ac 1, 5).<br/>La idea del baptisme era la d'emersió, el bapteedzo. Joan batejat amb aigua, submergit la gent en l'aigua, "vostè va a ser submergit en l'Esperit Sant en no molts dies."<br/>6 Quan s'hagueren reunit, li van demanar: "Senyor, ¿restauraràs ara el regne a Israel?"<br/>"Quan serà, Senyor? Quan és el moment d'aquesta restauració?" I Jesús està parlant amb ells ara, no sobre el regne, sinó sobre el poder que rebran per al servei. I així Ell deixa de banda la seva pregunta.<br/>Dient-los: No us correspon a vosaltres conèixer els temps o les estacions que el Pare ha posat en el seu poder (Ac 1,7).<br/>"No és perquè vostè sàpiga." Van viure constantment en l'anticipació de la creació immediata del regne. Durant tota la vida de Jesús, que estaven esperant en qualsevol moment per entrar a la cabina telefònica i sortir com el salvador del món. Shazzam! Mostrant el seu poder i enderrocar els governs del món, establint el regne de Déu sobre la terra. I estaven esperant diàriament aquest canvi per succeir. I cada vegada que Jesús parlava d'anar a Jerusalem, ser lliurat a les mans de l'home pecador, i després ser crucificat, "Oh, oh no, Senyor. No, no entén el regne, Senyor. Estigui tan lluny de Tu." Quan Jesús va morir a la creu, tots van quedar molt decebuts.<br/>Els dos deixebles en el camí a Emaús, tan trist. "Ei, companys. Com és que esteu tan trist com el seu caminar al llarg?" "Què voleu dir? Vostè ha de ser un estrany per aquí si no sap les coses que han estat passant últimament a Jerusalem." "Què coses?" "Oh, un home anomenat Jesús de Natzaret...oh home, era poderós i poderós. La unció de Déu estava sobre la seva vida. Havíem esperat que en ell hi havia la alliberació d'Israel, però el van crucificar. Havíem esperat... ara és mort." Ara ha ressuscitat, i diu: "D'aquí a uns dies, companys, rebreu la promesa del Pare." "Oh, quina promesa? La promesa de l'establiment del regne?" Veu, era legítim que preguntin. "És això, Senyor? D'acord! ¿Aquest és el moment? ¿Ara establiràs el teu regne? -No. No és per a vosaltres conèixer aquells temps que el Pare ha designat o que el Pare té en el seu propi poder. Però, rebràs poder quan l'Esperit Sant vindrà sobre vosaltres.<br/>Ara bé, aquí, la preposició grega epi s'utilitza per significar una nova relació que havien de tenir amb l'Esperit Sant. En l'Evangeli segons Joan, capítol 14, com Jesús està allà prometent enviar l'Esperit Sant, Ell va dir: "No us deixaré sense consol. Jo vindré a vosaltres i pregaré al Pare, que us enviarà un altre consolador, l'Esperit de la veritat, que el món no pot rebre, perquè no el veu ni el coneix, però vosaltres el coneixeu, perquè habita amb vosaltres i ell estarà en vosaltres" (Jn 14,17-18). La mateixa preposició grega com la nostra, només que l'escriuen "en" en lloc de "en". Relació doble hi ha en Joan: Ell està amb tu, però Ell va a habitar en tu. Però ara Jesús va dir que va a rebre poder quan l'Esperit Sant ve sobre vostè. La preposició grega epi, que es tradueix en diferents textos al llarg del Nou Testament com "sobre" o "sobre" o m'agrada, "desborda".<br/>En el capítol setè de l'evangeli de Joan: "L'últim dia, el gran dia de la festa, Jesús es va quedar allà a la muntanya del temple i va cridar a la gent: Si algú té set, que vingui a mi i begui; i el qui beu de l'aigua que jo dono, del seu interior brollaran torrents d'aigua viva." Joan va dir: "Això va parlar de l'Esperit, que encara no s'ha donat el que els qui creuen en ell han de rebre" (Jn 7,37-39). Què va dir de l'Esperit? Que seria com un torrent d'aigua viva que brolla. M'agrada: "Quan l'Esperit t'omple", sobre tu, o sobre tu, o desborda de tu. Així doncs, la triple relació: Ell és amb tu abans de la teva conversió, Ell és el que et fa adonar que ets un pecador, Ell és el que assenyala a Jesucrist com la resposta mentre convenç el món del pecat, dels justos i del judici. En el moment en què obriu la vostra vida i el vostre cor a Jesucrist i el convideu a entrar, l’Esperit Sant ve i comença a habitar en vosaltres. Ell estarà en vosaltres. ¿No sabeu que no sou vostres, que heu estat comprats per un preu; glorifiqueu, doncs, Déu en el vostre cos i en el vostre esperit, que són seus, i no sabeu que el vostre cos és temple de l'Esperit Sant que hi ha en vosaltres? No us emborratxeu de vi, en què hi ha excés, sinó ompliu-vos, o sigueu omplerts de l'Esperit" (1Co 6:19-20, Ef 5:18). Però ara hi ha una tercera relació. Aquesta és una experiència potenciadora.<br/>Rebreu la dinàmica, quan l'Esperit Sant vindrà sobre vosaltres, i sereu testimonis de mi.<br/>I així la dinàmica, per ser un testimoni de Jesucrist. És interessant que la paraula testimoni en grec és la paraula martus d'on obtenim la nostra paraula màrtir. I en grec significa màrtir. Un testimoni és algú que no només proclama el que creu, viu el que creu, és el que creu, i ho creu tan fortament, que si cal, morirà pel que creu. Així és com de forta és la seva creença. És un martus. No pots aturar-lo, no té por de morir pel que creu.<br/>Recordeu quan Pau tornava a Jerusalem i Àgab va baixar de Cesarea, prengué el cinturó de Pau i es va lligar i va dir: «També l'home que té aquest cinturó serà lligat quan arribi a Jerusalem». I els amics de Pau van començar a plorar, dient: "Oh, Pau, no vagis, no vagis." I ell va dir: "Què vols dir amb aquestes llàgrimes? Creus que em dissuadiràs? Creus que estic preocupat per ser lligat? Estic a punt de morir." Era un martus. "Estic a punt de morir." Ser mort per la teva fe no et va fer un màrtir; perquè vas ser un màrtir, vas ser condemnat a mort. Perquè vas ser un testimoni, perquè vas creure tan fort. Per tant, no et va fer testimoni, només va demostrar el que eres. Ets un testimoni tot el temps. Si no haguessis estat un martus, mai hauries anat a la mort. T'hauries retractat; t'hauries dit, "Whoa, whoa, espera, espera. Espereu, canviem de rumb aquí. Crec que puc haver comès un error." Llavors dius, "Bé, no era un martus. Robar un cavall no et converteix en un lladre de cavalls; només demostra que ho eres. Ningú roba un cavall llevat que sigui un lladre de cavalls. Per tant, robar-lo no et converteix en un lladre de cavalls, només demostra que has estat tot el temps. Ser màrtir només demostra el que vas ser un testimoni, un martus. "I sereu testimonis". I no és interessant que la majoria d'ells van ser màrtirs? "Testimonis per a mi."<br/>El testimoni havia de ser a Jerusalem i a tota la Judea (Ac 1,8).<br/>El testimoni va començar a casa. El lloc més difícil, no? És començar a casa a Jerusalem, i després la zona al voltant de Jerusalem, la zona de Judea. I després es va estendre a Samaria. I després va ser per anar a les parts més remotes del món. I mentre estudiem el llibre dels Fets, veurem aquest mateix progrés. Com va començar el testimoni a Jerusalem. Ho veurem en el següent capítol. I llavors veurem com va començar a escampar-se per Judea. I després Felip va pujar a Samaria, i després finalment Pau i Bernabé són cridats a anar a les parts més remotes del món. I així el testimoniatge es va estendre a través de la unció i el poder de l'Esperit Sant.<br/>Quan hagué dit aquestes coses, mentre ells ho veien, el van endur, i un núvol el va acollir fora dels seus ulls (Ac 1,9).<br/>Aquesta és la promesa final feta per Jesús als seus deixebles. Aquesta és, les últimes paraules abans de la seva ascensió. Per descomptat, més tard va venir i va parlar amb Pau i altres, però abans de la seva ascensió, aquesta és la seva última paraula. I després d'haver dit aquestes coses, mentre ells el miraven, va ser enlairat i un núvol el va acollir fora dels seus ulls.<br/>I mentre miraven fixament al cel mentre pujava, veieren dos homes que estaven al seu costat amb vestits blancs.<br/>Suposem que eren àngels.<br/>També deia: «Homes de Galilea, per què mireu al cel? Aquest mateix Jesús, que ha estat endut d’entre vosaltres al cel, vindrà de la mateixa manera que l’heu vist pujar al cel» (Ac 1,11).<br/>Ells el van veure pujar al cel i el veuran quan torni: «Mira, el Senyor ve amb deu milers dels seus sants a fer el judici a la terra» (Jd 1,14-15). A aquell que ens va estimar i es va donar a si mateix per nosaltres i que ens ha fet al nostre Déu, reis i sacerdots que regnaran amb ell a la terra, ve el Senyor, i tots els ulls el veuran, i també els qui el van traspassar ploraran (Ap 1, 5-7). Així que la vinguda del Senyor. Tots els ulls el veuran. Els Testimonis de Jehovà diuen que ja ha vingut, però era una vinguda secreta. Com que només els deixebles el van veure marxar, només els deixebles, dels Testimonis de Jehovà, el van veure tornar. Però Jesús els digué: «Si us diuen que ha entrat en secret i ha entrat en una cambra secreta, no ho cregueu» (Mt 24,26).<br/>«Aquest mateix Jesús, que ha estat endut d’entre vosaltres al cel, vindrà de la mateixa manera que l’heu vist pujar al cel».<br/>Ara hi ha un vers molt interessant en II Joan, vers Acte 1:7 , "Perquè molts enganyadors han entrat al món que no confessen que Jesucrist ha vingut en la carn." Això, per desgràcia, és una mala traducció del grec. Perquè aquest participi està en el temps present i s'ha de traduir "vindrà en la carn." Els que neguen que Jesucrist vindrà en la carn. Què diu Joan d'ells? "Són un enganyador i un anticristo. Mireu de no perdre allò que hem fet, sinó de rebre una plena recompensa, perquè tot aquell qui transgredeix i no segueix la doctrina de Crist, no té Déu. El qui es manté en la doctrina de Crist, té tant el Pare com el Fill. I si algú arriba a la vostra porta (el dissabte al matí) i no porta aquesta doctrina, no el rebeu a casa vostra, i no li digueu adéu. Perquè el que li diu adéu és partícip de les seves males obres" (2Jn 1,7-11). Pregunta'ls una pregunta, "És Jesús que ve en la carn?" Simplement pregunta'ls aquesta pregunta. I si diuen que no, només recorda el que Joan va advertir i el que Joan va dir. "Si algú no confessa que Jesucrist ve en la carn." Recordeu quan ell estava amb els deixebles i va dir: "Dóna'm alguna cosa per menjar"? Ell va dir: "Ja saps, els esperits no mengen; tocar-me. Mira? Sóc jo." Així, doncs, aquest mateix Jesús tornarà de la mateixa manera que el van veure pujar al cel. I jo, per un, crec que la vinguda és molt aviat.<br/>Després es van reunir a Jerusalem des de la muntanya anomenada de les Oliveres, que és un viatge de dissabte des de Jerusalem. Quan van entrar, van pujar a una cambra alta, on vivien Pere, Jaume, Joan, Andreu, Felip, Tomàs, Bartomeu, Mateu, Jaume, fill d’Alfeu, Simó Zelote i Judes, germà de Jaume. I tots ells van continuar units en la pregària i la súplica, amb les dones, i Maria, la mare de Jesús, i amb els seus germans (Ac 1,12-14).<br/>Aquesta és l'última menció de Maria, la mare de Jesús. En aquest punt i a partir d'ara, no hi ha cap altra menció d'ella en els Fets dels Apòstols o en les epístoles. No hi ha cap menció de la seva mort o de la seva ascensió miraculosa al cel, sense mort. No hi ha res esmentat a les Escriptures. És silenciós.<br/>Els seus germans serien probablement una referència a Jaume i Judes i a aquells altres germans que eren fills de Josep i Maria.<br/>La sala de dalt - hi ha alguns que diuen que és la mateixa sala de dalt en què Jesús va tenir l'Última Cena amb els seus deixebles. I no obstant això, hi ha altres que sostenen que aquesta sala de dalt és una sala en el recinte del temple on es va reunir l'església primerenca. Prengui la seva elecció.<br/>En aquells dies, Pere es va aixecar enmig dels deixebles i digué: «Homes i germans, el nombre dels seus noms era d'uns cent vint, cal que s'hagi complert aquesta Escriptura, que l'Esperit Sant, per boca de David, va parlar abans de Judes, que era un guia per als qui van agafar Jesús» (Ac 1,15-16).<br/>Aquí de nou, Pere encara el seu mateix impetuós. Ells estan esperant en la pregària i súplica, i Pere s'aixeca i diu: "Germans, hi ha una Escriptura que s'ha de complir." I ja sabeu que seguirà endavant: "Aixequem el programa, sortegem i descobrim qui ocuparà el lloc de Judes." Crec que Pere va tornar a estar en la carn, manifestant la seva naturalesa impetuosa. I crec que la història futura de l'església en el llibre dels Fets ho assenyala. Estic interessat en la comprensió de Pere de les Escriptures, com que està citant de tants llocs en l'Antic Testament. Pere manifesta una molt gran comprensió de les Escriptures de l'Antic Testament que és un punt a favor seu.<br/>Noteu que Pere atribueix a l'Esperit Sant les coses que David va escriure. De manera que, "Tota l'Escriptura és donada per inspiració de Déu" ( 2Tm 3:16 ). No forma part de les Escriptures. Perquè, si em dieu que part de les Escriptures són donades per inspiració de Déu, llavors he de preguntar-vos: "Quines parts són per inspiració i quines parts no són per inspiració?" I llavors tu ets l'autoritat que em diu en quina part puc creure i en quina part no puc creure. I en el moment que Déu ja no és l'autoritat, però tu ets l'autoritat, estic en problemes. Aneu amb compte amb els qui diuen: "Bé, no podeu creure totes les Escriptures." Les mateixes Escriptures diuen: "Tota l'Escriptura és inspirada per Déu." I aquí, Lluc per escrit del que Pere estava dient, declara que David era en realitat el portaveu de l'Esperit Sant. L'Esperit Sant, per boca de David, va parlar sobre Judes.<br/>Perquè havia estat comptat entre nosaltres, i havia aconseguit una part d’aquest ministeri. Però ara aquest home va comprar un camp amb la recompensa de la iniquitat, i va caure de cap per avall (Actes 1:17-18),<br/>Va comprar el camp, el camp del terrisser, tal com Zacaries l'onzè capítol declara.<br/>Va caure cap per avall, es va esmicolar enmig, i totes les seves entranyes van brollar (Actes 1:18).<br/>Hi ha qui troba una discrepància en les Escriptures, perquè en un dels evangelis se'ns diu que quan Judes va tornar i va tractar de tornar els diners, i van dir, "Ei, és el teu problema. No podem agafar-lo." I posar-lo de nou en el tresor del temple. "És diners de sang." Llavors el va llançar allà al terra del temple i va sortir i es va penjar. Aquí Pere ens diu que va caure de cap i només va saltar. I hi ha els que imaginen una discrepància. Molt senzill, va pujar a l'arbre per penjar-se, va lligar la corda al voltant del coll i la va lligar a la seva extremitat i va saltar. I la força de la caiguda va trencar la corda o el seu cap, i va caure al canó i tal com ho va dir aquí.<br/>Tots els habitants de Jerusalem ho sabien, de manera que el camp es diu en la seva llengua Acèldama, és a dir, el camp de la sang. Perquè està escrit en el llibre dels Salms: Que la seva habitació sigui desolada, i que ningú no hi visqui; i que el seu bisbat en prengui un altre (Ac 1,19-20).<br/>Ara, en realitat, està citant dos salms diferents aquí. De Sal 69:25 , que posa junts amb Sal 109:8 . I posant els dos junts troba aquestes profecies sobre Judes.<br/>Per això d'aquests homes (Actes 1:21)<br/>Ara aquí és on estan buscant algú per prendre el lloc de Judes per ser un apòstol. Aquí estan les qualificacions que buscaven en aquell moment.<br/>Per tant, d'aquests homes que han estat en companyia amb nosaltres tot el temps que el Senyor Jesús era entre nosaltres i fora (Actes 1: 21),<br/>Ara recordeu que hi havia molts deixebles, molts deixebles dels quals Jesús va triar deu per ser apòstols. I la paraula apòstol significa "un que és enviat." O va triar dotze per ser apòstols, així que va enviar els dotze. El nombre de govern humà. "Només en tenim onze. Necessitem un per prendre el lloc de Judes, però necessitem un que hagi estat amb nosaltres des del principi amb Jesús."<br/>Des que va ser batejat per Joan fins al dia que va ser endut d’entre nosaltres, cal que se’ls ordeni que siguin testimonis de la seva resurrecció.<br/>Així que aquests eren els requisits que estaven buscant. Algú que havia estat al voltant de tot el temps. Des del temps del baptisme de Joan fins a l'ascensió. I un que va veure el Senyor ressuscitat, i així podia donar fet de la resurrecció, el seu testimoni del fet.<br/>Ara l'apòstol Pau, més tard en afirmar el fet que era un apòstol va dir, "No he vist el Crist ressuscitat?" Evidentment, aquest era un dels requisits de l'apostolat. Algú em va preguntar, "Hi ha apòstols avui?" Bé, no ho sé. No crec que hi hagi en el mateix sentit que estaven en el Nou Testament. Segurament no hi ha ningú avui que pugui donar testimoni de la resurrecció com ho van fer.<br/>En designaren dos: Josep, que es deia Barsabàs, i Maties. I van pregar dient: «Senyor, tu que coneixes el cor de tots, mostra’ns si d’aquests dos que has escollit,<br/>Crec que sovint cometem aquest error de donar al Senyor dues opcions, totes dues errònies. Limitant Déu, veieu. Tenim tanta tendència a fer això. Òbviament, Pau va ser l'elecció de Déu. Peter va ser impetuós, i saltant la pistola va dir, "Hey, hem de fer alguna cosa, ja saps, hem d'ajudar Déu. Saps, falta un i l'hem d'omplir." I tanmateix, "Déu, quin d'aquests dos vols?" I donar a Déu les dues opcions.<br/>perquè prengués part en aquest ministeri i en aquest apostolat, del qual Judes va caure per la transgressió, per tal d'anar al seu lloc. I així van repartir la seva sort (Actes 1:25-26);<br/>Una manera interessant per la qual van tractar de determinar la voluntat de Déu. Anem a tirar els daus, esbrinar quina és la voluntat de Déu és aquí. És interessant per a mi, les diverses maneres que la gent ha ideat per discernir la voluntat de Déu. Ara, en els temps de l'Antic Testament tenien una manera interessant d'arribar al sacerdot, que preguntaria al Senyor per ells a través de l'Urim i el Tumim, les "llums i les perfeccions". Exactament el que aquests Urim i Tumim eren, no ho sabem. Estic segur que no eren les ulleres de colors que Joseph Smith va trobar amb les Taules Daurades; les ulleres màgiques, que quan les poseu, de sobte podeu llegir l'escriptura jeroglífica.<br/>Hi ha qui diu que l'Urim i Tumim eren en realitat una pedra negra i una pedra blanca que es portava en una bossa al pit del sacerdot. Pregaven i feien al Senyor una pregunta en particular. Recordeu que David preguntava al Senyor: «Senyor, ¿sortirem contra els filisteus?» La resposta va ser: «No». L’endemà, doncs, de nou: «Senyor, ¿sortirem contra els filisteus?» La resposta va ser: «Sí». Feien preguntes específiques, i el Senyor els dirigia a través de l'Urim i el Thummin. Diuen que el sacerdot pregava, buscava Déu, i després entrava i treia una de les dues pedres. Si era la pedra blanca, era una resposta sí. Si fos un no, llavors seria la pedra negra que treuria. Alguns fins i tot diuen que obtenim el terme blackballed d'aquest Urim i Thummim. De fet, de tornada en l'original és un no al vot en contra d'un projecte o idea en particular. Què eren els Urim i Tumim, no ho sabem. Però durant el període de l'Antic Testament, van utilitzar un mètode de sorteig per determinar la voluntat de Déu.<br/>Així que aquí els deixebles estan recollint en la mateixa cosa que estan llançant els daus per veure quin dels dos companys que Déu havia escollit per substituir Judes Iscariot.<br/>La sort va recaure sobre Maties, que va ser comptat amb els onze (Actes 1:26).<br/>Ara qui en el món és Matthias? Ningú mai ha sentit a parlar d'ell abans o després. Serà interessant conèixer Matthias i esbrinar qui és i el que va fer. Crec que de la història posterior, és obvi assumir que Déu va triar Pau com a apòstol. Pau ho declara ell mateix. Ara aquesta és l'última vegada que llegim d'ells que busquen discernir la voluntat de Déu mitjançant el llançament de sorts o per una mena de casualitat d'una cosa.<br/>Conec avui un home que, buscant discernir la voluntat del Senyor, pregarà i li farà una pregunta. Tindrà deu cèntims a la butxaca, i mentre prega, agafarà els cèntims amb els ulls tancats i els posarà sobre la taula, i si tots arriben al cap, és un sí. Una cosa interessant, de tant en tant, tots sortiran cap amunt, i això és bastant bones probabilitats. No obstant això, no trobem cap patró per a això després de l'Esperit Sant va ser donat. Un cop l'Esperit Sant va venir sobre l'església, llavors l'Esperit Sant va començar a parlar amb ells i dirigir-los. I l'Esperit Sant va dir: "Separeu-me Pau i Bernabé pel ministeri on els he cridat" ( Actes 13: 2 ). I l'Esperit Sant els va enviar. Així que trobem l'església més directament guiada per l'Esperit Sant. Una vegada que l'Esperit Sant va venir, aquest llançament de daus per esbrinar la voluntat de Déu es va deixar de banda.<br/>"<br/><br/>Versió King James<br/><br/>Aquesta és la Versió del Rei Jaume de 1769 de la Bíblia Sagrada (també coneguda com la Versió Autoritzada).

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Gabor T. Rittersporn va dir: "Moltes de les víctimes es dedicaven sincerament als principis del bolxevisme." Això amplifica la prova que els ideals bolxevics que havien estat les arrels del Partit Comunista estaven sent desordenats i destruïts per les Purgues. El partit es va esgotar i els antics membres van veure com Stalin utilitzava la gran purga com una eina per transformar Rússia d'un estat d'un partit a una dictadura incontestada.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell està nerviosos baralles en lloc de nerviosos poders estel·lars. Vaig estar a 750 la temporada passada amb poder 8 nit i és molt difícil anar més enllà que, com, els poders estel·lars juguen un paper realment dominant. El matchmaking també és escombraries. Quan toco gem grab (al voltant de 600 trofeus), sovint hi ha enfrontaments on l'equip enemic té un jugador més que nosaltres que és màxim i no és ni tan sols que tenim un lvl 9 per competir enfront d'això. De vegades fins i tot hi ha enfrontaments on l'equip enemic està completament maxed i cap de nosaltres ho són. és per això que no joc estrelles baralles seriosament més. No és ni tan sols com no hi ha molts jugadors que no estan maxed i al voltant de 600 trofeus. És molest.<br/>Edit: Crec que supercell hauria de tenir almenys un mecanisme bàsic que pren la mitjana de nivells de baralles a l'hora de configurar partits.<br/><br/>Excepte que els trofeus no indiquen realment la teva habilitat. Indiquen l'habilitat dels companys amb els quals et col·loques. I estic bé amb jugar contra baralles de nivell superior, però quan un equip és de nivell 10 i l'altre no ho és, clarament està desequilibrat.<br/><br/>Recomano aconseguir uns bons amics per jugar amb, jo i 2 amics van aconseguir els meus amics potència 1 tick a la posició 28 jugant gem grab amb una certa composició tot el dia i ho vam fer sense que un sol de nosaltres ser maximitzat amb els nostres baralles.<br/><br/>Sé com se sent que solia tenir baralles en trofeus alts amb baix nivell i és difícil anar més enllà i tot el que em deia a mi mateix "Vull tenir poders estel·lars" realment supercell necessita fer l'equilibri amb els poders estel·lars o almenys fer un millor sistema de matchmaking.<br/><br/>Em sento una mica això. No sóc tan bo en el joc com vostè, però vaig aconseguir Emz a 500 al poder 1 i el matchmaking va ser horrible. Jugadors Maxed a tot arreu! I no va ajudar que la majoria dels meus companys d'equip tenien al voltant de 5-8k trofeus ... Vaig haver de recórrer a l'enfrontament en solitari d'última hora perquè puc emboscar jugadors desconeguts o simplement jugar una mica agressiu en els moments adequats. Però realment desitjaria que pogués ser una mica més fàcil per a les persones que volen empènyer baralles a rangs de trofeus realment alts sense tenir el luxe de poders estel·lars.<br/><br/>Altho Spike encara és bo sense corbeball. Curveball era només una ajuda per colpejar els seus tirs amb més freqüència com a punt. Però fins i tot abans que es va alliberar corbeball, punt era una baralla molt forta, de manera que seguirà sent el mateix ara.<br/><br/>Estic d'acord que haurien d'haver emboscada nerviosa, però crec que estan tractant d'equilibrar tant Snappy Sniping i Ambush, ja que tots dos s'estan fusionant amb aquest canvi. S'estava convertint en una mica poderós, però encara no digne de nervis<br/><br/>No estic segur d'això, però ara que Darryl té un bo notable, mirant les seves noves estadístiques, sembla que Darryl podria eclipsar Bull, ja que no només sempre pot causar més dany que Bull, sinó que ja no morirà tan aviat, de manera que la seva supervivència serà similar sense poder estel·lar (encara que la supervivència de Bull encara és notablement millor que la de Darryl Guy si ho hagués fet). No només això, el super de Darryl pot regenerar-se automàticament, el que significa que Darryl pot ser capaç de ser jugat eficaçment tant com un pes pesat com un assassí al mateix temps (abans que sigui un pes pesat però decent com un assassí).<br/><br/>Però ell està sobrevalorat af. I s'obtenen trofeus amb ell molt fàcilment. Així que im una mica d'acord amb el nervi. Fins i tot no l'he jugat des de quan el vaig aconseguir a 500 (fa uns 5 mesos), així que no m'importa tant tampoc.<br/><br/>Per què Poco/Penny no té un nervi HP, si són Marksman/Healer respectivament no un tanc?<br/>Per què la tanquinesa de Rosa no es nervia, la tos redueix el dany del 70%?<br/>Per què es permet que Tick tingui el rang més alt i el pokedamage més lliure de tot el joc?<br/>Per què no s'aconsegueix un HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Sigui com sigui, era l'emboscada que era OP, no la base Piper. Jo diria que l'emboscada és la millor potència estel·lar en el joc (ara encara més, ja que el percentatge de dany augmentava indirectament) i la base Piper era una baralla inferior a 10.<br/><br/>El que Supercell hauria de fer és revertir els dos nervis, reduir l'emboscada a 600, i reduir el franctirador Snappy a 0.25, ja que seria indirectament polit pel dany base.<br/><br/>Sí i crec que van anar una mica massa lluny amb Rosa, perquè ara ella és bàsicament el millor toro ara quan es tracta de tancar, que ha estat durant un temps. Ara, Darryl podria ser un toro més petit, més poderós<br/><br/>Per què? Sento que necessita una millora en gairebé tot excepte el seu poder estel·lar. La seva salut i velocitat la fan una mica més difícil d'utilitzar, perquè pot morir bastant fàcilment, i és realment difícil per a ella atrapar baralles més ràpides com Crow. El seu poder estel·lar està una mica trencat encara que... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Treball autònom Part 1<br/><br/>Quan acceptes una feina en qualsevol organització, has de realitzar diversos treballs segons els requisits del teu ocupador i pots obtenir una quantitat fixa d'ingressos com a salari. Vostè pot dirigir una petita botiga al detall, botiga de sastreria, restaurant, fleca i confiteria, saló de bellesa, etc. a la seva localitat. Vostè pot participar en el comerç o la fabricació a petita escala o proporcionar algun servei per un preu. Aquestes activitats econòmiques es coneixen com a treball autònom.<br/><br/>Significat del treball autònom<br/><br/>Els nostres pares, mares, germans, germanes i altres poden participar en diferents activitats econòmiques a través de les quals es guanyen la vida. Aquestes persones es dediquen a una activitat econòmica anomenada ocupació assalariada o ocupació remunerada. Però hi ha moltes persones que es dediquen a una ocupació o a algun negoci que inicien i gestionen per compte propi. Posen el seu millor esforç i assumeixen tot tipus de riscos per seguir amb èxit les seves carreres. Tot el guany del seu treball va a ells. Tots nosaltres hem vist petites botigues de queviures, botigues de sastreria, botigues mèdiques, etc. a la nostra localitat. Aquestes són propietat i gestionades per una persona, amb o sense l'ajuda d'alguns assistents. Les seves activitats econòmiques s'anomenen treball autònom. Per tant, quan una persona es dedica a qualsevol activitat econòmica i la gestiona per si mateixa, es coneix com treball autònom.<br/><br/>Objectius<br/><br/>Després d'estudiar aquesta lliçó, podràs:<br/><br/>Imatge dels objectius<br/><br/>Imatge dels objectius<br/><br/>Característiques del treball autònom<br/><br/>Implica la propietat i la gestió d'activitats per part d'una persona, encara que pot comptar amb l'ajuda d'una o dues persones per ajudar-la. Per tant, el treball autònom també pot proporcionar ocupació a altres persones.<br/><br/>Els guanys per treball autònom no són fixos. Depèn dels ingressos que es puguin obtenir produint o comprant i venent béns o prestant serveis a altres persones a un preu.<br/><br/>En el treball autònom, només el propietari ha d'agafar el benefici i assumir el risc de pèrdua. Per tant, trobem un vincle directe entre l'esforç i la recompensa en el treball autònom.<br/><br/>Requereix una certa quantitat d'inversió de capital, encara que pot ser petita.<br/><br/>En el treball autònom, una persona és lliure de prendre decisions pel que fa a dirigir el seu negoci de manera rendible i aprofitar qualsevol oportunitat que pugui sorgir per a l'expansió del seu negoci. Dóna completa llibertat per treballar segons la pròpia voluntat i dins dels paràmetres de les lleis vigents.<br/><br/>Per tant, el treball autònom pot ser definit com una activitat econòmica que un pot realitzar per si mateix com una ocupació remunerada, i això pot consistir en produir i vendre béns, comprar i vendre béns, o prestar serveis per un preu. |
