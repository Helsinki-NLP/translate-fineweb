In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blog de certificació de RCP en línia<br/><br/>Data: 23 de juliol de 2014<br/><br/>La malaltia renal intersticial autosòmica dominant és una col·lecció rara de malalties que afecten les funcions conegudes del ronyó. En termes senzills, la condició es caracteritza per: es desenvolupa una malaltia renal i se sotmet a un trasplantament de ronyó i altres malalties associades amb la concentració àcida en la sang i la gota. En teoria, la condició es produirà fins i tot si el canvi genètic és heretat d'un dels progenitors i esporàdicament es produeix quan no hi ha antecedents familiars.<br/><br/>Noms comuns de malaltia renal intersticial autosòmica dominant<br/><br/>La malaltia també té altres noms: malaltia medul·lar del ronyó quístic, encara que aquest nom no s'utilitza tant perquè la majoria de les persones que pateixen aquesta condició no tenen quists medul·lars. També es coneix com a nefropatia hiperuricèmica juvenil. La malaltia tendeix a afectar persones de 20 a 50 anys. Aquesta última condició, com s'ha esmentat anteriorment, es produeix en nens petits, cosa que es tradueix per obtenir-la d'ambdós pares.<br/>La malaltia renal quística és una condició hereditària per la qual els quists al centre de cada ronyó perden gradualment la seva capacitat de funcionar correctament. Els quists es refereixen a ampolles anormals de líquid al ronyó. La condició espanta encara més el ronyó fent incapaç de concentrar l'orina i com a resultat, produint massa orina. Els seus símptomes inclouen micció excessiva, desitjos de sal, debilitat, confusió, sagnat, fatiga, hipo freqüent, pressió arterial baixa, nàusees i vòmits, mals de cap, pell pàl·lida, sensació reduïda a les mans, pèrdua de pes, entre molts altres. Altres complicacions inclouen: anèmia, úlceres, pèrdua de densitat òssia, infertilitat i altres problemes relacionats amb el cor.<br/>La seva anàlisi incorpora anàlisis de sang per comprovar els nivells de sodi i les funcions renals generals, anàlisis d'orina per comprovar els nivells de concentració i altres desequilibris, raigs X per comprovar la mida dels ronyons que es poden alterar a causa de l'augment de les concentracions d'orina, biòpsia renal i proves genètiques per verificar qualsevol canvi genètic que pugui haver tingut lloc en el seu temps.<br/>Si bé la malaltia no té un tractament tallat i sec, es pot centrar en les mesures de control, que inclouen la ingesta de líquids i sal per complementar la perduda a mesura que la malaltia progressa a les últimes etapes. Això també ajuda a reduir la deshidratació. Altres tractaments inclouen la presa de medicaments prescrits i canvis de dieta i ingestes mínimes d'aliments que contenen fòsfor i potassi. Altres complicacions també poden requerir un per tenir un trasplantament de ronyó. Bàsicament, aquesta no és una malaltia curable, sinó més aviat manejable una vegada detectada en les primeres etapes.<br/><br/>El factor comú però diferent de la malaltia renal intersticial autosòmica dominant<br/><br/>La nefronoftisis i la malaltia renal quística medul·lar s'agrupen principalment perquè, en essència, comparteixen les mateixes característiques però amb una lleugera diferència en els patrons d'herència als primers que afecten els nens i els últims que afecten els adults joves i els grups d'edat més avançada. Característiques similars per a tots dos són la concentració d'orina resistent a l'ADH que condueix a poliúria i polidípsia, anèmia i malalties renals.<br/>L’antiga condició abans esmentada és autosòmica recessiva que representa el 15% de les malalties cròniques i causa ESRD durant la primera infància, mentre que l’última és autosòmica dominant amb unes quantes noves mutacions esporàdiques i causa ESRD per a persones entre les edats de 30 i 50. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Locke sobre l'estat de la naturalesa<br/><br/>Tema: FilosofiaParaules: 2539Pàgines: 9Ago 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes i Locke són alguns dels filòsofs polítics més influents que han escrit mai en anglès. L'estat de la natura, que precedeix l'organització de les societats complexes, és la premissa comuna que tant Hobbes com Locke comparteixen però interpreten de maneres diferents. Els primers veuen els humans en el seu estat natural com igualment perillosos i lliures de perseguir els seus objectius egoistes sense restriccions per les nocions inexistents de justícia, per la qual cosa el seu estat natural equival a la "guerra de tot home contra tot home" (Hobbes 76). Aquest últim, d'altra banda, veu els humans en la seva condició original com igualment valuosos i restringeix la llibertat natural per la idea de justícia que requereix no fer mal als altres, que permet definir l'estat de la natura com "assistència mútua i preservació" en lloc de la guerra (Locke 15). La diferència clau entre els relats dels dos filòsofs sobre l'estat natural és que Locke utilitza consideracions ètiques mentre que Hobbes no, i finalment porta a Hobbes a imaginar un estat que exerceix un poder il·limitat sobre els éssers humans, mentre que Locke limita el govern pels principis morals, que considera una llei natural.<br/><br/>Hobbes basa les seves suposicions sobre l'estat de la natura en el fet que totes les persones són aproximadament iguals en les seves capacitats físiques i mentals. Ell admet que alguns individus poden demostrar una major força física o intel·lecte superior, però insisteix que "quan tot es compta junts, la diferència entre l'home i l'home no és tan considerable" (Hobbes 74). Com que els humans són aproximadament iguals en les seves capacitats, també tenen esperances similars per assolir els seus fins i satisfer les seves necessitats (Hobbes 75). Com a resultat lògic d’aquesta igualtat, quan la gent comença a competir pels recursos escassos, ningú no pot sentir-se completament segur en les seves possessions. Fins i tot si una persona poderosa, astuta i capaç aconsegueix subjugar «les persones de tots els homes que pot», encara no garanteix la seguretat última (Hobbes 75). Com que cap humà no pot obtenir tal superioritat sobre els altres que el faci totalment immune a la seva força intel·lectual, cap humà no pot sentir-se completament segur quan està envoltat dels seus iguals. La igualtat de Hobbes en l'estat natural és la igualtat de la por, on tots els humans es veuen com a competidors perillosos.<br/><br/>Igual que Hobbes, Locke considera que tots els éssers humans són fonamentalment iguals, però assigna un significat molt diferent al terme. Des de la seva perspectiva, no és la igualtat de capacitats, sinó, més aviat, la igualtat de valor. Opina que les persones "nascudes promiscuament amb tots els mateixos avantatges de la natura" haurien de gaudir lògicament de la perfecta igualtat entre elles, ja que no hi ha cap raó per considerar a ningú inherentment més valuós (Locke 8). L'única base possible per designar algunes persones com a superiors a d'altres seria si Déu "per qualsevol declaració manifesta de la seva voluntat, posa uns sobre els altres" (Locke 8). Com que aquesta sanció divina de superioritat està absent, Locke conclou que la igualtat natural de tots els representants de la humanitat no ha de ser qüestionada. Hobbes aborda la igualtat de manera pragmàtica i subratlla que les persones en el seu estat natural són igual de perilloses, però Locke empra un enfocament ètic i emfatitza que els humans són igual de valuosos als ulls de Déu. Aquest desacord és només la primera diferència entre els dos autors basat en el fet que Locke inclou Déu com una premissa en la seva filosofia política, mentre que Hobbes no ho fa.<br/><br/>Un altre tret característic del relat de Hobbes sobre l'estat natural és la seva interpretació de la llibertat. Segons Hobbes, l'estat de la natura implica llibertat il·limitada per fer el que sigui necessari per a la seva existència continuada. El filòsof defineix la llibertat com "l'absència d'obstacles externs" en l'ús de les pròpies habilitats per assolir els propis objectius (Hobbes 79). El propòsit principal de cada ésser sensible és mantenir la seva existència continuada. Com a conseqüència, la llibertat hobbesiana equival a l'oportunitat sense obstacles de fer qualsevol cosa que, segons el propi judici, sigui més adequada per preservar la pròpia vida i les pròpies possessions (Hobbes 79). L'única limitació a la llibertat és que una persona no pot fer res contradictori per sostenir la seva vida o destruir "els mitjans de preservar-la" (Hobbes 79). A part d'això, no hi ha límits, i tothom té "dret a tot, fins i tot al cos dels altres" si això afavoreix la supervivència (Hobbes 80). Per tant, la llibertat natural, tal com ho veu Hobbes, és l'absència d'obstacles imposats externament en la recerca del dret a tot per sostenir i assegurar la seva existència continuada.<br/><br/>Locke també defensa la idea de la llibertat natural, però, com era d'esperar, s'apropa a ella d'una manera que és significativament diferent de la de Hobbes. Tan aviat com comença a discutir la llibertat en l'estat de natura, immediatament assenyala que un estat de llibertat no equival a "un estat de llicència" (Locke 9). El filòsof identifica dues limitacions específiques a la llibertat humana en l'estat de natura. La primera és idèntica a la introduïda per Hobbes: encara que sigui lliure i independent, una persona, no obstant això, "no té llibertat per destruir-se a si mateixa" (Locke 9). Segons Locke, cada ésser humà té l'obligació natural de no "danyar a un altre en la seva vida, salut, llibertat o possessions". Igual que amb la seva interpretació de la igualtat, l'autor basa aquesta afirmació en motius ètics i religiosos: les persones han de preservar l'existència de l'altre ja que són totes creacions del mateix "omnipotent i infinitament savi creador" (Locke 9). Així, Locke limita la llibertat en l'estat natural molt més estrictament que Hobbes introduint l'obligació d'abstenir-se de fer mal tant a un mateix com als altres.<br/><br/>Les diferències entre els dos autors també es manifesten en els seus relats sobre la justícia en l'estat natural de la humanitat. Pel que fa a Hobbes, la delimitació de pràctiques justes i injustes és simplement una qüestió de llei. No hi ha jurisprudència en l'estat de naturalesa, i l'única llei que regeix els éssers humans en la seva condició original és una llei natural que només els obliga a buscar la seguretat personal. En conseqüència, res no pot ser injust en l'estat original de la humanitat: "els conceptes de justícia i injustícia, de justícia i d'injustícia, no tenen lloc ni significat en absència de la llei estrictament aplicada" (Hobbes, 78). Mentre la gent utilitza la seva llibertat virtualment il·limitada per competir implacablement entre si pels recursos, als quals tenen igualment dret, no tenen criteris per diferenciar entre accions justes i injustes. Per tant, l'estat de naturalesa hobbesiana desafia la idea mateixa de justícia, ja que l'autor l'interpreta com una mera funció de la llei formalitzada i establerta.<br/><br/>Locke atribueix un significat diferent a la justícia i la veu no tant en termes legislatius com en termes ètics. Aquest article ja esmentava que, a diferència de Hobbes, Locke empra nocions ètiques i generalment basa la seva filosofia política en presumpcions morals en lloc de purament pràctiques. La llei natural de Locke, a diferència de la de Hobbes, obliga els éssers humans a cuidar-se els uns als altres en lloc de simplement deixar que tothom s'encarregui d'ells mateixos. Com a resultat, hi ha un lloc per a la justícia i la injustícia en el seu estat de naturalesa. El mateix autor assenyala aquest fet quan assenyala que ningú no ha de privar a un altre de la seva vida dels mitjans per preservar-la "a menys que sigui per fer justícia a un delinqüent" (Locke 9). Aquesta afirmació revela amb la màxima claredat que, segons Locke, hi ha justícia en l'estat de la natura, i, a més, els humans han de preservar-la activament. El criteri de justícia, que manca a l'estat natural de Hobbes, és la segona limitació a la llibertat natural imposada per Locke: una acció és injusta si constitueix una amenaça injustificada a la vida i a les possessions d'una altra persona.<br/><br/>Aquestes diferències en el tractament dels dos autors de la igualtat, la llibertat i la justícia o la injustícia culminen en la seva interpretació de la relació entre l'estat de natura i l'estat de guerra. Des de la perspectiva de Hobbes, els dos són sinònims, perquè la competició implacable és l'únic resultat lògic de posar persones amb capacitats equivalents i necessitats similars en un entorn amb recursos limitats. Afirma clarament aquesta connexió: "si dos homes desitgen la mateixa cosa, que no obstant això no poden gaudir tots dos, es converteixen en enemics" i, per tant, estan en estat de guerra entre si (Hobbes 75). No obstant això, com que els humans són nombrosos i tots posseeixen capacitats i necessitats similars, aquesta competència es manifesta no només en les interaccions individuals sinó també a nivell de la humanitat en el seu conjunt. Mentre tots els éssers humans tinguin drets iguals i il·limitats a tots els recursos i fins i tot als cossos i a la vida dels altres, l'estat de la natura és una guerra de "tots els homes contra tots els homes" (Hobbes 76). Aquesta interpretació fosca prové directament de la representació de Hobbes de l'estat de la natura com governat únicament pels impulsos egoistes dels individus.<br/><br/>Locke, d'altra banda, diferencia entre l'estat de naturalesa i l'estat de guerra i assenyala que, si bé poden ocórrer simultàniament, no hi ha cap raó per identificar-se l'un amb l'altre. La definició de l'estat de guerra de Locke és pràcticament idèntica a la que ofereix Hobbes. Segons Locke, "el que intenta posar a un altre home en el seu poder absolut es posa així en un estat de guerra amb ell" (14). Aquesta explicació s'alinea perfectament amb la noció hobbesiana que el dret universal de tothom a tot, inclosos els cossos i les vides dels altres, condueix a l'estat de guerra. No obstant això, Locke es nega a equiparar l'estat de guerra i l'estat de la natura precisament perquè nega la interpretació de Hobbes de la llibertat natural. Atès que l'estat natural de Locke impedeix que les persones es facin mal els uns als altres a través de la segona limitació de la llibertat, un intent contra la llibertat d'una altra persona és una transgressió contra la llei natural. Mentre que per a Hobbes, la guerra és la condició de la humanitat per defecte, Locke la retrata com una perversió de l'estat de la natura en lloc de la seva regla.<br/><br/>Aquestes diferències en la delineació de l'estat sobre la natura i els seus constituents, com la llibertat, la igualtat, la justícia i la guerra, obre el camí als autors que contrasten amb les representacions del govern. Basant-se en la seva avaluació pessimista de l'estat de la natura, l'autor de Leviatan conclou que, en condicions de guerra, no hi pot haver una esperança definitiva per "viure el temps que la naturalesa normalment permet als homes viure" (Hobbes 80). La solució és establir el dret universal a tot i deixar a tothom "tanta llibertat contra els altres homes com permetria a altres homes contra si mateix" (Hobbes 80). Els participants del contracte social resultant inverteixen les llibertats il·limitades que han cedit en un sobirà, el portador del poder suprem, el propòsit del qual és preservar l'estatus quo aconseguit castigant totes les transgressions contra ell. El poder del sobirà és absolut: el governant té l'autoritat de "fer tot el que cregui necessari" per promoure la pau entre els seus súbdits perquè ningú no atempti contra la vida o la propietat d'un altre (113). Hobbes conclou que sense una figura tan inexpugnable amb dret a fer qualsevol cosa als subjectes, no hi pot haver pau ni garantia de seguretat.<br/><br/>Tot i que Locke està d'acord amb la necessitat de crear societats políticament organitzades, s'oposa a la idea de Hobbes del poder sobirà com il·limitat i inatacable. Com es va esmentar anteriorment, l'estat de natura de Locke no és tan terrible com el pintat per Hobbes a causa de l'obligació del poble de preservar no només a si mateix sinó també els uns als altres. Per tant, la necessitat del contracte social no sorgeix de la por dels altres, sinó de la pura comoditat. Les comunitats petites poden no necessitar nombroses lleis per resoldre conflictes i "oficials per supervisar el procés", però les associacions més grans troben aconsellable instituir governs per a aquest propòsit (Locke 57). No obstant això, el poder del govern no pot ser il·limitat, ja que resultaria en sotmetre els subjectes a una "voluntat inconstant, incerta, desconeguda, arbitrària d'un altre home" (Locke 17). Tal govern constituiria una doble violació de la llei natural. En acceptar el poder absolut d'una altra persona sobre la seva vida, un subjecte violaria la seva primera limitació que prohibeix fer-se mal a si mateix. Pel que fa al governant, destruir la llibertat d'una altra persona constituiria un dany directe i, com a tal, seria contradictori a la segona limitació.<br/><br/>Com a continuació directa del seu cas d'autoritat governamental il·limitada, Hobbes nega la separació de poders com a principi. Des de la seva perspectiva, el sobirà, una vegada instituït, posseeix "tot el poder de prescriure les regles" que regeixen la vida dels subjectes o, en termes més curts, el poder legislatiu (Hobbes 114). El sobirà també es reserva el dret d'"escoltar i decidir totes les controvèrsies" - és a dir, el poder judicial (Hobbes 114). Finalment, ja que el propòsit del sobirà és obligar els subjectes a abstenir-se de fer-se mal, no hi ha dubte que el poder executiu és també la seva prerrogativa exclusiva. La separació de poders com a concepte és aliena a Hobbes a causa de les seves opinions sobre l'estat de la natura. Crear una entitat política on les branques executiva, legislativa i judicial es controlin mútuament, és a dir, competeixin, significaria recrear l’estat hobbesià de naturalesa com a guerra en un nivell superior. Atès que el poble entra en un contracte social i institueix un govern per posar l'estat de naturalesa darrere seu, no per restablir-lo en una forma diferent, la separació de poders contradiu directament els punts de vista de Hobbes.<br/><br/>Locke, d'altra banda, abraça la separació de poder com un principi fonamental de la seva teoria política. El seu cas per a la separació és evident en la discussió dels límits del poder legislatiu. Com diu Locke, seria difícilment aconsellable "per a les mateixes persones, que tenen el poder de fer lleis, tenir també a les seves mans el poder d'executar-les" (76). El filòsof assenyala les imperfeccions de la naturalesa humana i el desig inherent de "agafar el poder" com a raó d'aquesta mesura cautelar (Locke 76). Igual que en el cas de Hobbes, el relat de Locke sobre la separació de poders deriva directament de la seva interpretació de l'estat de la natura. Si ja hi ha justícia en l’estat de naturalesa i el poble la pot entendre, qualsevol govern està inevitablement sotmès a la mateixa llei natural. Atès que el poder absolut sobre les persones viola ambdues limitacions d'aquesta llei, és aconsellable separar-la i distribuir-la perquè el govern funcioni adequadament.<br/><br/>Aquest article ha demostrat que, si bé les diferències entre els relats de Hobbes i Locke sobre l'estat natural de la humanitat són nombroses, en última instància, equival a la presència d'absència de premisses morals. Hobbes veu l'estat natural com el de la llibertat il·limitada, on les persones dotades de capacitats iguals i no lligades per cap noció moral, com la justícia, competeixen pels recursos incessantment. Locke, però, interpreta la igualtat i la llibertat èticament més que pràcticament i opina que la guerra és una perversió de l'estat natural, ja que la llei natural obliga els humans a no fer-se mal els uns als altres. Aquest desacord influeix en els enfocaments dels filòsofs al govern. Hobbes insisteix en un governant totpoderós, ja que, en absència de restriccions ètiques, cap altra autoritat podria forçar els humans a abstenir-se de fer-se mal els uns als altres. No obstant això, en l'opinió de Locke, concedir al govern poders il·limitats seria contradictori amb les limitacions ètiques incloses en la llei de la naturalesa, per la qual cosa, a diferència de Hobbes, advoca per la separació de poders. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | La policia de la moda: què va llançar Joc de Trons<br/><br/>El cantant canadenc-francès Abbas Hasan va posar un esforç cegador per eclipsar a tota la humanitat a la desfilada de moda 2014. No hi ha res de dolent en això, excepte que la seguretat és prioritària i el músic és un perill per a la salut aquí.<br/><br/>Ens adonem que vol ser una estrella. Malauradament, no va aconseguir el memoràndum on diuen als desesperats i als infames que l'estrellatge és una metàfora. No cal semblar-ho i, literalment, encendre la nostra visió. A més, l'Associació All Pakistan Aunty ha presentat oficialment una queixa contra ell. El mercat local s'ha assecat de cristalls falsos i monstruositats de lluentons. No tenen res a portar als seus tes alts quinzenals i afirmen que és el culpable. Pel que sembla, el vestit s'inspira en Joc de Trons. Pot, si us plau, quedar-se a compondre cançons tristes sobre el gos mort del seu veí en lloc de conceptualitzar vestits? O potser és el trauma de perdre el gos, la mort del qual clarament no ha acabat, ja que encara porta la seva carcassa.<br/><br/>El full de càrrega Outfit<br/><br/>Ningú pot decidir on comença el vestit i on acaba Abbas. Vostè mira amb fascinació, enfonsant-se en un profund abisme i es pregunta per què porta pantalons de cuir. El cavall de qui va matar per robar la sella embolicada a les espatlles? Va estar a la presó just abans de la seva aparença de catifa vermella i es va oblidar de treure les cadenes? Com sobreviurà a la pell sintètica i l'erupció post-sequin que està destinat a ser letal en una dosi tan alta? Per què encara estic viu?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>La seva inspiració va ser aparentment Game of Thrones, però finalment va acabar semblant que va ser llançat d'un restaurant víking. Si s'hagués trobat amb algun dels personatges de la sèrie, hauria estat assassinat en els primers cinc segons del primer episodi.<br/><br/>La salut mental o la falta d'ella: Algú el porta a un conseller el més aviat possible! Sembla estar sota el supòsit que portar un gos mort significa que l'únic amic que tenia en la seva vida encara està viu. Benvolgut Abbas:<br/><br/>1. La negació no és un riu a Egipte<br/><br/>2. La teva psique torturada no està ajudant la teva música, així que obté ajuda<br/><br/>3. Prova amics imaginaris<br/><br/>Sortida!<br/><br/>Tots nosaltres a la seu de la Policia de la Moda estem molt traumatitzats. Abbas és algú que no ens va agradar arrestar. Actualment està sota custòdia i intenta venjar-se posant-se vestits d'altres espectacles de fantasia. Simplement es va enganxar amb brillantor per tal de semblar-se a Edward Cullen de Crepuscle. Com a missatge de servei públic i per evitar més caigudes nervioses, li vam donar els següents exemples d'homes de la catifa vermella del mateix esdeveniment.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Quan tingueu dubtes, feu-ho de manera segura. El cantant s'assembla al vostre oncle mitjà en un shaadi. Un vestit negre senzill sense accessoris, encara que sigui un poc desproporcionat, és factible. L'aspecte de Zohaib es barreja amb tot i res, i quan no tens un sentit de la moda o els diners per contractar un estilista, això està bé. No comporta el risc d'aturada cardíaca per als companys assistents a un esdeveniment. Donada la delicada condició mental d'Abbas, aquesta mirada és el que hauria d'apuntar. Sempre i per sempre.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Un dia, després de dècades de teràpia, Abbas podria aspirar a portar vestits com el d'Ali Zafar. L'aspecte d'estiu es fa gairebé a la perfecció. Ali va arribar molt a prop de semblar un mestre d'un restaurant francès amb la seva jaqueta d'estiu blanca amb solapes negres, però la samarreta ho estalvia, sense importar el setí. Els seus pantalons haurien estat ridículs si no s'haguessin plegat als turmells. Les sabates són el que fan els finals feliços hipster chic. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Determinació de les propietats hidràuliques del sòl amb diferents líquids humectants : Una tesi presentada en compliment parcial dels requisits del Màster en Ciències de la Universitat de Lincoln<br/><br/>Abstracte<br/><br/>Les propietats hidràuliques del sòl com la conductivitat hidràulica, la retenció d'aigua i les relacions de l'aigua de les plantes dominen els processos de moviment de l'aigua. Per exemple, la infiltració, l'evaporació i el flux d'aigua dins del sòl. Com un fenomen generalitzat en el sòl, la repel·lència de l'aigua del sòl altera les funcions hidràuliques del sòl en resistir el flux d'aigua als sòls. A més, les propietats hidràuliques no només depenen del sistema de porus del sòl, sinó que també es veuen afectades per les propietats fisicoquímiques de les superfícies de porus. En comparació amb l'aigua, l'etanol no es veu afectat per la repel·lència de l'aigua a causa de la seva menor tensió superficial. El propòsit de l'ús de l'etanol és eliminar l'efecte de la repel·lència de l'aigua del sòl en les mesures de propietats hidràuliques. No obstant això, l'aplicació d'etanol pur al sòl natural pot degradar els materials orgànics del sòl i conduir a canvis en les propietats físiques. Per tant, les solucions d'etanol aquós poden ser una opció alternativa. No obstant això, la viabilitat d'utilitzar etanol aquós per determinar la corba de retenció de líquids del sòl segueix sent desconeguda. Aquest estudi té com a objectiu provar la viabilitat de les solucions aquoses d'etanol (0, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% i 100% v/v) per establir la corba de retenció de líquids sota un petit rang de pressió aplicada en mostres de sorra gruixuda amb diferent humitat i sòl natural modificat orgànic (Loam de limonada de Templeton (TSL) amb compost de bolets, biochar, efluent de lacti i efluent municipal). El resultat va mostrar que la desorció de les solucions aquoses d'assaig d'etanol en comparació amb l'aigua va ser més ràpida en aproximadament 1 a 3 vegades en funció del contingut de líquid a la mateixa pressió aplicada i el temps per arribar a cada equilibri. Els resultats de l'experiment de sorra suggereixen que quan la concentració de solució aquosa d'etanol era inferior al 50%, les pèrdues per evaporació eren inferiors a l'1% i les diferències relatives entre el líquid de prova i l'aigua eren inferiors al 10%. No obstant això, les pèrdues d'evaporació van ser de l'11,06% i el 24,6%, i les diferències relatives van ser al voltant del 15% i el 30% en solució d'etanol al 50% i al 100%, respectivament. Per contra, les esmenes orgàniques a Templeton no només van augmentar la capacitat de retenció d'aigua, sinó que també van reduir les pèrdues d'evaporació. Les pèrdues d'evaporació en sòl TSL i TSL amb modificacions orgàniques sòl van ser amb 1% en solucions amb menys de 50% de contingut d'etanol. Les pèrdues d'evaporació de 50% i 100% d'etanol van ser 2,8% i 2,9%, respectivament. Les diferències relatives entre l'aigua i el líquid de prova eren similars a l'experiment de sorra quan les concentracions de líquid de prova eren inferiors al 50%. No obstant això, les diferències relatives en la solució d'etanol al 50% i al 100% van ser menors que en la mostra de sorra amb al voltant del 10% i el 15%, respectivament. A més, l'anàlisi de la diferència relativa va suggerir que gairebé totes les solucions aquoses d'etanol tenien un contingut líquid volumètric més baix a la mateixa pressió subministrada en comparació amb l'aigua, que era un reflex de les solucions aquoses d'etanol desorbades més ràpidament que l'aigua a pressió equivalent. Per tant, es podria considerar que entre el 10% i el 40% de les solucions d'etanol són una alternativa per determinar les propietats hidràuliques del sòl a causa de la seva velocitat de desorció més ràpida i no es veuen afectades per la repel·lència de l'aigua del sòl. A causa de l'evaporació i la dissolució de material orgànic, les solucions aquoses d'etanol per sobre de la concentració del 50% no eren adequades per a sorra gruixuda o sòl de textura mitjana....
