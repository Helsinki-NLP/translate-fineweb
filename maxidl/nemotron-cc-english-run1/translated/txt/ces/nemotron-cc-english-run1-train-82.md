In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online certifikační blog CPR<br/><br/>Datum: 23. července 2014<br/><br/>Autozomálně dominantní intersticiální onemocnění ledvin je vzácná sbírka onemocnění postihujících známé funkce ledvin.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbesův vs. Lockův účet o stavu přírody<br/><br/>Téma: FilosofieSlova: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes a Locke patří k nejvlivnějším politickým filozofům, kteří kdy psali anglicky. Stav přírody, který předchází organizaci složitých společností, je společným předpokladem, že Hobbes i Locke sdílejí, ale interpretují různými způsoby. První vidí člověka ve svém přirozeném stavu jako stejně nebezpečného a svobodného, aby sledoval své egoistické cíle bez omezení neexistujícími představami o spravedlnosti, což je důvod, proč se jeho přirozený stav rovná "válce každého člověka proti každému člověku" (Hobbes76). Ten na druhé straně považuje lidi v jejich původním stavu za stejně hodnotné a omezuje přirozenou svobodu myšlenkou spravedlnosti, která vyžaduje, aby neubližovala ostatním, což umožňuje definovat stav přírody jako "vzájemnou pomoc a zachování" spíše než válku (Locke 15). Klíčový rozdíl mezi popisy obou filozofů přirozeného stavu je, že Locke používá etické úvahy, zatímco Hobbes ne, a to nakonec vede Hobbese k představě, že stát vykonává neomezenou moc nad lidmi, zatímco Locke omezuje vládu morálními principy, které považuje za přirozený zákon.<br/><br/>Hobbes zakládá své domněnky o stavu přírody na skutečnosti, že všichni lidé jsou zhruba rovni ve svých fyzických a duševních schopnostech. Připouští, že někteří jedinci mohou projevovat větší fyzickou sílu nebo vyšší intelekt, ale trvá na tom, že "když se vše počítá dohromady, rozdíl mezi člověkem a člověkem není tak značný" (Hobbes 74). Vzhledem k tomu, že lidé jsou zhruba rovnocenní ve svých schopnostech, mají také podobné naděje na dosažení svých cílů a uspokojení svých potřeb (Hobbes 75). Logickým důsledkem této rovnosti je, že když lidé začnou soutěžit o vzácné zdroje, nikdo se nemusí cítit zcela bezpečně ve svém majetku. I když se mocnému, prohnanému a schopnému člověku podaří podmanit si "osoby všech lidí, které může", stále to nezaručuje konečnou bezpečnost (Hobbes 75). Protože žádný člověk nemůže získat takovou převahu nad ostatními, která ho činí zcela imunním vůči síle jeho intelektu, žádný člověk se nemůže cítit zcela v bezpečí, když je obklopen svými rovnými. Hobbesova rovnost v přirozeném stavu je rovnost strachu, kde se všichni lidé považují za nebezpečné konkurenty.<br/><br/>Stejně jako Hobbes, Locke považuje všechny lidské bytosti za zásadně rovnocenné, ale přiřazuje tomuto termínu velmi odlišný význam. Z jeho pohledu to není rovnost schopností, ale spíše rovnost hodnoty. Říká, že lidé "promiskuitně zrození pro všechny stejné výhody přírody" by měli logicky požívat dokonalé rovnosti mezi nimi, protože není důvod považovat někoho ze své podstaty za hodnotnějšího (Locke 8). Jediným možným základem pro označení některých lidí za nadřazené ostatním by bylo, kdyby Bůh "jakýmkoli zjevným prohlášením své vůle postavil jednoho nad druhého" (Locke 8). Vzhledem k tomu, že takové božské schválení nadřazenosti chybí, Locke dochází k závěru, že přirozená rovnost všech představitelů lidstva nemá být zpochybňována. Hobbes přistupuje k rovnosti pragmaticky a zdůrazňuje, že lidé ve svém přirozeném stavu jsou stejně nebezpeční, ale Locke uplatňuje etický přístup a zdůrazňuje, že lidé jsou v Božích očích stejně cenní. Tato neshoda je jen prvním rozdílem mezi oběma autory založeným na skutečnosti, že Locke zařazuje Boha jako premisu do své politické filozofie, zatímco Hobbes ne.<br/><br/>Dalším charakteristickým rysem Hobbesova popisu přirozeného stavu je jeho interpretace svobody. Podle Hobbese, stav přírody znamená neomezenou svobodu dělat vše, co je nezbytné pro něčí další existenci. Filosof definuje svobodu jako "nepřítomnost vnějších překážek" při využívání svých schopností k dosažení svých cílů (Hobbes 79). V důsledku toho Hobbesova svoboda představuje neomezenou příležitost udělat cokoliv, co by podle něčího úsudku bylo nejvhodnější pro zachování života a majetku (Hobbes 79). Jediným omezením svobody je, že člověk nemůže dělat nic, co by bylo v rozporu s udržením jeho života nebo zničením "prostředků k jeho zachování" (Hobbes 79). Kromě toho neexistují žádné hranice a každý má "právo na všechno, dokonce i na své tělo", pokud to podporuje přežití (Hobbes 80). Přirozená svoboda, jak se na ni dívá Hobbes, je absence vnějších překážek při prosazování práva na všechno, aby se udržela a zajistila další existence.<br/><br/>Locke také podporuje myšlenku přirozené svobody, ale nepřekvapivě k ní přistupuje způsobem, který je výrazně odlišný od Hobbesova. Jakmile začne diskutovat o svobodě ve stavu přírody, okamžitě poznamenává, že stav svobody se nerovná "stavu licence" (Locke 9). Filozof identifikuje dvě specifická omezení lidské svobody ve stavu přírody. První z nich je totožný s tím, který zavedl Hobbes: jakkoli svobodný a nezávislý, člověk přesto "nemá svobodu zničit sám sebe" (Locke 9). Podle Locka má každá lidská bytost přirozenou povinnost "neškodit druhému v jeho životě, zdraví, svobodě nebo majetku". Stejně jako jeho interpretace rovnosti, autor zakládá toto tvrzení na etických a náboženských důvodech: lidé by měli zachovat existenci jeden druhého, protože všichni jsou výtvory stejného "všemocného a nekonečně moudrého tvůrce" (Locke 9). Locke tedy omezuje svobodu v přirozeném stavu mnohem přísněji než Hobbes tím, že zavádí povinnost zdržet se ubližování sobě i ostatním.<br/><br/>Rozdíly mezi oběma autory se projevují také v jejich výkladu spravedlnosti v přirozeném stavu lidstva. Pokud jde o Hobbese, vymezení spravedlivých a nespravedlivých praktik je pouze záležitostí zákona. Ve stavu přírody neexistuje žádná jurisprudence a jediným zákonem, který řídí lidské bytosti v jejich původním stavu, je přirozený zákon, který je zavazuje pouze k tomu, aby usilovaly o osobní bezpečnost. Výsledkem je, že v původním stavu lidstva nemůže být nic nespravedlivé: "poznámky o správné a nesprávné spravedlnosti a nespravedlnosti" nemají místo a žádný význam, pokud neexistuje přísně prosazovaný zákon (Hobbes 78). Dokud lidé využívají svou prakticky neomezenou svobodu k tomu, aby mezi sebou nemilosrdně soupeřili o zdroje, na které mají stejný nárok, nemají žádná kritéria pro rozlišení mezi spravedlivými a nespravedlivými činy. Proto hobbesovský stav přírody odporuje samotné myšlence spravedlnosti, protože ji autor interpretuje jako pouhou funkci formalizovaného a zavedeného práva.<br/><br/>Locke přiřazuje spravedlnosti jiný význam a nehledí na ni ani tak v zákonodárném, jako v etickém smyslu. Tento dokument již zmínil, že na rozdíl od Hobbese, Locke používá etické pojmy a obecně zakládá svou politickou filozofii na morálních spíše než čistě praktických předpokladech. Lockův přirozený zákon, na rozdíl od Hobbese, zavazuje lidské bytosti, aby se o sebe staraly, spíše než aby prostě nechaly všechny, aby se starali o sebe. V důsledku toho je v jeho stavu přírody místo pro spravedlnost a nespravedlnost. Autor poukazuje na tuto skutečnost sám, když poznamenává, že nikdo by neměl připravit druhého o jeho nebo její život o prostředky k jeho zachování "pokud to není k výkonu spravedlnosti na pachatele" (Locke 9). Toto prohlášení odhaluje s maximální jasností, že podle Locka existuje ve stavu přírody spravedlnost, a navíc ji lidé musí aktivně chránit. Kritérium spravedlnosti, které Hobbesův přirozený stav postrádá, je druhé omezení přirozené svobody uložené Lockem: čin je nespravedlivý, pokud představuje neoprávněnou hrozbu pro život a majetek jiné osoby.<br/><br/>Tyto rozdíly v zacházení obou autorů s rovností, svobodou a spravedlností či nespravedlností vrcholí v jejich interpretaci vztahu mezi stavem přírody a stavem války. Z Hobbesova pohledu jsou oba dva synonyma, protože nemilosrdná konkurence je jediným logickým výsledkem umístění lidí s rovnocennými schopnostmi a podobnými potřebami do prostředí s omezenými zdroji. Vyslovuje přímo toto spojení: "Chtějí-li dva lidé totéž, co však nemohou mít oba, stávají se nepřáteli" a jsou tedy ve válečném stavu mezi sebou (Hobbes 75). Jelikož jsou však lidé početní a všichni mají podobné schopnosti a potřeby, tato soutěž se projevuje nejen v individuálních interakcích, ale také na úrovni lidstva jako celku. Dokud všichni lidé mají stejná a neomezená práva na všechny zdroje a dokonce i na svá těla a životy, je stav přírody válkou "každého člověka proti každému člověku" (Hobbes 76). Tato pochmurná interpretace vychází přímo z Hobbesova zobrazení stavu přírody, který je řízen pouze egoistickými nutkáními jednotlivců.<br/><br/>Locke na druhé straně rozlišuje mezi stavem přírody a stavem války a poukazuje na to, že i když se mohou vyskytovat současně, není důvod se ztotožňovat. Lockeova definice válečného stavu je prakticky totožná s tou, kterou nabídl Hobbes. Podle Lockeho, "ten, kdo se snaží dostat jiného člověka do své absolutní moci, se tím dostává do válečného stavu s ním" (14). Toto vysvětlení je v dokonalém souladu s Hobbesovou představou, že všeobecné právo každého na všechno, včetně těl a životů ostatních lidí, vede k válečnému stavu. Přesto Locke odmítá srovnávat stav války a stav přírody právě proto, že popírá Hobbesovu interpretaci přirozené svobody. Vzhledem k tomu, že Lockův přirozený stav brání lidem, aby si navzájem ubližovali prostřednictvím druhého omezení svobody, pokus o svobodu jiné osoby je přestupkem proti přirozenému zákonu. Zatímco pro Hobbese je válka standardně stavem lidstva, Locke ji vykresluje spíše jako zvrácenost stavu přírody než její vlády.<br/><br/>Tyto rozdíly ve vymezení státu o přírodě a jejích voličích, jako je svoboda, rovnost, spravedlnost a válka, dláždí cestu autorům kontrastujícím s vyobrazením vlády. Na základě svého pesimistického hodnocení stavu přírody autor Leviathan dospívá k závěru, že za válečných podmínek nemůže existovat žádná definitivní naděje na "prožití doby, kterou příroda obvykle dovoluje lidem žít" (Hobbes 80). Řešením je stanovit všeobecné právo na všechno a ponechat každému "tolik svobody proti jiným lidem, jako by dovolil jiným lidem proti sobě" (Hobbes 80). Účastníci výsledné společenské smlouvy investují neomezené svobody, které se vzdali, do suveréna – nositele nejvyšší moci, jehož cílem je zachovat dosažený status quo potrestáním všech přestupků proti němu. Svrchovaná moc je absolutní: vládce má autoritu "udělat vše, co bude považovat za nezbytné" k podpoře míru mezi svými poddanými, aby nikdo nenapadl život nebo majetek druhého. Hobbes dospívá k závěru, že bez takové nenapadnutelné postavy, která má právo cokoli dělat poddaným, nemůže být žádný mír a žádná záruka bezpečnosti.<br/><br/>I když Locke souhlasí s nutností vytvoření politicky organizovaných společností, přesto se staví proti Hobbesově představě o svrchované moci jako neomezené a nenapadnutelné. Jak bylo zmíněno výše, Lockův stav přírody není zdaleka tak hrozný jako ten, který namaloval Hobbes, protože lidé jsou povinni zachovat nejen sebe, ale i sebe navzájem. Potřeba společenské smlouvy proto nevyplývá ze strachu ostatních, ale z naprostého pohodlí. Malé komunity nemusí potřebovat mnoho zákonů k řešení konfliktů a "důstojníci dohlížet na proces," ale větší sdružení považují za vhodné ustanovit vlády pro tento účel (Locke 57). Moc vlády však nemůže být neomezená, protože by to mělo za následek podrobení poddaných "nestálé, nejisté, neznámé, svévolné vůli jiného člověka" (Locke 17). Taková vláda by představovala dvojí porušení přirozeného zákona. Souhlasem s absolutní mocí jiného člověka nad jeho životem by subjekt porušil své první omezení, které zakazuje ublížit si. Pokud jde o vládce, zničení svobody jiné osoby by představovalo přímou škodu a jako takové by bylo v rozporu s druhým omezením.<br/><br/>Jako přímé pokračování svého argumentu pro neomezenou vládní autoritu Hobbes popírá oddělení moci jako princip. Z jeho pohledu suverén, jakmile je ustanoven, má "celou moc předepisovat pravidla", která řídí život poddaných, nebo v kratších termínech, zákonodárnou moc (Hobbes 114). Suverén si také vyhrazuje právo "vyslechnout a rozhodnout všechny spory" - to znamená soudní moc (Hobbes 114). A konečně, protože celý účel suveréna je přinutit poddané, aby se zdrželi vzájemného poškozování, nemůže být pochyb o tom, že výkonná moc je také jeho výhradní výsadou. Oddělení moci jako koncepce je Hobbesovi cizí kvůli jeho názorům na stav přírody. Vytvoření politické entity, kde by se výkonné, zákonodárné a soudní složky vzájemně kontrolovaly – to znamená soutěžily – by znamenalo znovuvytvoření Hobbesova stavu přírody jako války na vyšší úrovni. Vzhledem k tomu, že lidé uzavírají společenskou smlouvu a ustanovují vládu, aby stav přírody za nimi, a ne ji znovu v jiné formě, oddělení moci protiřečí Hobbesovým názorům přímo.<br/><br/>Locke, na druhé straně, přijímá rozdělení moci jako základní princip své politické teorie. Jeho argument pro oddělení je patrný v diskusi o mezích zákonodárné moci. Locke říká, že by bylo stěží vhodné, aby "stejné osoby, které mají moc vytvářet zákony, měly ve svých rukou také moc je vykonávat" (76). Filozof poukazuje na nedokonalosti lidské přirozenosti a vrozenou touhu "uchopit se moci" jako na důvod tohoto preventivního opatření (Locke 76). Stejně jako v Hobbesově případě, i Lockeovo vyprávění o rozdělení moci vychází přímo z jeho výkladu stavu přírody. Je-li již ve stavu přirozenosti spravedlnost a lidé jí mohou rozumět, pak je každá vláda nevyhnutelně podřízena stejnému přirozenému zákonu. Vzhledem k tomu, že absolutní moc nad lidmi porušuje obě omezení tohoto zákona, je vhodné ji oddělit a distribuovat, aby vláda řádně fungovala.<br/><br/>Tento dokument ukázal, že zatímco rozdíly mezi Hobbesovými a Lockovými záznamy o přirozeném stavu lidstva jsou četné, nakonec se rovnají nepřítomnosti morálních předpokladů. Hobbes pohlíží na přirozený stav jako na stav neomezené svobody, kdy lidé obdařeni rovnými schopnostmi a nevázáni žádnými morálními představami, jako je spravedlnost, neustále soupeří o zdroje. Locke však vykládá rovnost a svobodu spíše eticky než prakticky a tvrdí, že válka je zvráceností přirozeného stavu, neboť přirozený zákon zavazuje lidi, aby si navzájem neubližovali. Hobbes trvá na všemocném vládci, protože při absenci etických omezení by žádná jiná autorita nemohla přinutit lidi, aby se zdrželi vzájemného poškozování. Přesto by podle Lockeho udělení neomezených pravomocí vládě bylo v rozporu s etickými omezeními zakotvenými v přírodním právu, a proto na rozdíl od Hobbese obhajuje dělbu moci. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Originální název: What Game of Thrones<br/><br/>Kanadsko-francouzský zpěvák Abbas Hasan dal oslepující úsilí zastínit celé lidstvo na Fashion Parade 2014. Na tom není nic špatného, kromě bezpečnosti je prioritou a hudebník je zde zdravotní riziko.<br/><br/>Dostali jsme, že chce být hvězdou. Bohužel, nedostal poznámku, kde říkají zoufalý a nechvalně známý, že hvězda je metafora. Nemusíte vypadat jako jeden a doslova zapálit náš pohled. Také All Pakistan Aunty Association oficiálně podala stížnost na něj. Místní trh je plný falešných krystalů a flitrovaných obludností. Nemají co nosit na své dvoutýdenní vysoké čaje a tvrdí, že je na vině. Očividně je outfit inspirovaný Game of Thrones. Může se, prosím, držet psaní smutných písní o mrtvém psu svého souseda místo konceptualizace oblečení? Nebo je to možná trauma ze ztráty psa, jehož smrt zjevně neskončila, protože stále nosí jeho mrtvolu.<br/><br/>Nabíjecí list Outfit<br/><br/>Nikdo nemůže rozhodnout, kde začíná oblečení a kde končí Abbas. Zíráte fascinovaně, klesáte do hluboké propasti a divíte se, proč má na sobě kožené kalhoty. Čí kůň zabil, aby ukradl sedlo přehozené přes ramena? Byl ve vězení těsně před tím, než se objevil na červeném koberci a zapomněl sundat řetězy? Jak přežije syntetickou kůži a vyrážku po sequinu, která bude v tak vysokém dávkování smrtící? Proč jsem stále naživu?<br/><br/>Nápad<br/><br/>Jeho inspirací byla zřejmě Hra o trůny, ale nakonec vypadal, jako by byl vyhozen z vikinské restaurace. Kdyby narazil na některou z postav ze seriálu, byl by zabit v prvních pěti sekundách první epizody.<br/><br/>Duševní zdraví nebo jeho nedostatek: Někdo ho dostat k poradci ASAP! Zdá se, že je za předpokladu, že nosit mrtvého psa znamená, že jediný přítel, který měl ve svém životě, je stále naživu. Milý Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Popírání není řeka v Egyptě<br/><br/>2. Vaše mučená psychika nepomáhá vaší hudbě, takže si vyhledejte pomoc<br/><br/>3. Zkuste imaginární přátele<br/><br/>Vykašli se na to!<br/><br/>Všichni na ředitelství módní policie jsme vážně traumatizováni. Abbas je někdo, koho jsme nebavili zatýkání. V současné době je ve vazbě a snaží se pomstít tím, že si oblékne oblečení z jiných fantasy show. Jen se třpytil, aby vypadal jako Edward Cullen z Twilight. Jako poselství veřejné služby a aby se zabránilo dalšímu nervovému zhroucení, dali jsme mu následující příklady mužů z červeného koberce stejné události.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Když máte pochybnosti, hrajte na jistotu. Zpěvák vypadá jako váš průměrný strýc na šaadi. Obyčejný černý oblek bez příslušenství, i když je to trochu nepřiměřené, je funkční. Zohaibův vzhled je smíchán se vším a ničím, a když nemáte smysl pro módu nebo peníze na pronájem stylisty, je to v pořádku. Nenese riziko srdeční zástavy pro spoluúčastníky na akci. Vzhledem k jeho delikátní psychické kondici by se měl zaměřit na tento pohled.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Jednoho dne, po desetiletích terapie, by Abbas mohl usilovat o to, aby nosil oblečení jako Ali Zafar. Ali byl opravdu blízko k tomu, aby vypadal jako maetre d ve francouzské restauraci s bílou letní bundou s černými klopami, ale košile to šetří, bez ohledu na satén. Jeho kalhoty by byly směšné, kdyby nebyly složeny u kotníků. Boty jsou to, z čeho jsou vyrobeny hipsterské šik happy endy. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Určení půdních hydraulických vlastností s různými smáčecími kapalinami : Práce předložená v částečném splnění požadavků na titul Master of Science na Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstraktní<br/><br/>Hydraulické vlastnosti půdy, jako je hydraulická vodivost, zadržování vody a vztahy s vodou rostlin, dominují procesům pohybu vody. Například infiltrace, odpařování a průtok vody v půdě. Jako rozšířený jev v půdě, půdní vodoodpudivost mění půdní hydraulické funkce tím, že brání průtoku vody do půdy. Hydraulické vlastnosti navíc závisí nejen na pórovitém systému půdy, ale jsou také ovlivněny fyzikálně-chemickými vlastnostmi povrchů pórů. Ve srovnání s vodou není ethanol ovlivněn vodoodpudivostí kvůli nižšímu povrchovému napětí. Účelem použití ethanolu je eliminovat účinek půdní vody na měření hydraulických vlastností. Použití čistého ethanolu do přírodní půdy však může degradovat organické materiály půdy a vést ke změnám fyzikálních vlastností. Alternativní možností proto mohou být vodné roztoky ethanolu, nicméně proveditelnost použití vodného ethanolu pro stanovení křivky retence půdní kapaliny zůstává neznámá. Cílem této studie je otestovat proveditelnost vodných roztoků ethanolu (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % a 100 % v/v) pro stanovení křivky retence kapaliny při malém rozsahu aplikovaného tlaku ve vzorcích hrubého písku s různou smáčivostí a organicky upravenou přírodní půdou (prašná půda s houbovým kompostem, biouchem, mléčným odpadem a komunálním kompostem byla 15 % hmotnostních). Výsledek ukázal, že desorpce zkušebních vodných roztoků ethanolu ve srovnání s vodou byla rychlejší přibližně 1 až 3x na základě obsahu kapaliny při stejném aplikovaném tlaku a času pro dosažení každé rovnováhy. Výsledky experimentu s pískem naznačily, že když byla koncentrace vodného roztoku ethanolu nižší než 50 %, ztráty způsobené odpařováním byly nižší než 1 % a relativní rozdíly mezi zkoušenou kapalinou a vodou byly nižší než 10 %. Ztráty z odpařování však činily 11,06 % a 24,6 % a relativní rozdíly byly kolem 15 % a 30 % v 50 % a 100 % roztoku ethanolu. Naproti tomu organické změny v bažině Templeton nejen zvýšily schopnost zadržovat vodu, ale také snížily ztráty odpařování. Ztráty odpařování v půdě TSL a TSL s organickými změnami půdy byly s 1 % v roztocích s méně než 50 % obsahem ethanolu. Ztráty odpařování 50 % a 100 % ethanolu byly 2,8 % a 2,9 %. Relativní rozdíly mezi vodou a zkušební kapalinou byly podobné experimentu s pískem, kdy koncentrace zkušební kapaliny byly nižší než 50 %. Relativní rozdíly v 50 % a 100 % roztoku ethanolu však byly menší než ve vzorku z písku, přičemž se jednalo o přibližně 10 % a 15 %. Navíc analýza relativního rozdílu naznačovala, že téměř všechny vodné roztoky ethanolu měly nižší objemový obsah kapaliny při stejném dodávaném tlaku ve srovnání s vodou, což bylo odrazem vodných roztoků ethanolu, které se pod ekvivalentním tlakem desorbovaly rychleji než voda. Proto by 10 % až 40 % roztoků ethanolu mohlo být považováno za alternativu pro stanovení půdních hydraulických vlastností vzhledem k jejich rychlejší desorpční rychlosti a neovlivnění půdní vodoodpudivostí. Vzhledem k odpařování a rozpuštění organického materiálu, vodné roztoky ethanolu nad 50% koncentrace nebyly vhodné pro hrubý písek nebo středně texturované půdy.... [Zobrazit úplný abstrakt] |
