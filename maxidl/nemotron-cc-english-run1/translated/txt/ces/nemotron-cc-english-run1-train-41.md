| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 listopadu 2015<br/>Zveřejnil(a) to Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa je vytrvalá rostlina, která se daří v bažinatých subtropických a tropických oblastech po celém světě. Vysoce ceněná bylina je klíčovou složkou Doxiderol, výživového doplňku, který zlepšuje kognitivní funkce. Bacopa byla vybrána pro svou schopnost chránit mozek a zvýšit acetylcholin, biochemický posel, který umožňuje nervovému systému přenášet informace.<br/><br/>Ájurvédští lékaři poprvé popsali terapeutické vlastnosti bacopy v roce 300 př.nl. Lékaři zaznamenali schopnosti bacopy zvýšit inteligenci a paměť. Téměř o 2500 let později, rostoucí počet moderních výzkumů potvrzuje kognitivní výhody bacopy zaznamenané v ajurvédském textu.<br/><br/>V roce 1987 výzkumníci v Indii hodnotili účinky bacopy na intelektuální funkci dětí školního věku. Během čtyřtýdenní studie podávali bacopu 40 dětem, které byly ve věku 6 až 8 let. Vědci zjistili, že Bacopa zvyšuje vnímání a paměť. Děti byly schopny řešit bludiště cvičení rychleji a přesněji po obdržení Bacopa. Mnoho rodičů v Indii běžně používá Bacopa ke zlepšení intelektuálního vývoje svých dětí.<br/><br/>12-týdenní studie publikovaná v srpnu 2001 vydání Psychopharmacology zkoumala účinky Bacopa na kognitivní funkce. Vědci náhodně přidělili zdravé dobrovolníky ve věku 18 až 65 let, aby dostávali Bacopa nebo neaktivní látku. Také použili dvojitě zaslepenou konfiguraci pro studii, aby zakryli identitu produktů. Vědci používají tento návrh, aby zajistili, že výsledky testů jsou platné, protože eliminuje předsudky výzkumníků a účastníků. Skupina bacopa zaznamenala výrazné zlepšení v rychlosti, s jakou byla schopna zpracovat vizuální informace. Účastníci se také rychleji učili a efektivněji ukládali nové vzpomínky.<br/><br/>V roce 2007, Texas A & M College of Medicine laboratorní studie odhalila jeden z mechanismů odpovědných za Bacopa je schopnost podporovat zdraví mozku. Bacopa používá polyfenoly, aby zabránila oxidačnímu stresu a poškození, které způsobuje zdravým mozkovým buňkám. Bacopa také snižuje škodlivé usazeniny látky známé jako beta-amyloid, která je primární složkou plaku v mozku pacientů s Alzheimerovou chorobou.<br/><br/>Dvojitě zaslepená studie publikovaná v červenci 2008 v časopise Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine hodnotila účinek bacopy na starší pacienty. Studie potvrdila, že bacopa zvyšuje kognitivní výkon a zároveň snižuje stres. Podle autorů přínosy dosažené v této studii potvrdily výsledky dřívějšího výzkumu.<br/><br/>90denní studie publikovaná v prosinci 2008 ve vydání Phytotherapy Research potvrzuje kognitivní výhody, které byly dříve prokázány v jiných bacopa studiích. Bacopa významně zlepšila schopnost účastníků dočasně ukládat a používat informace potřebné pro dokončení složitého úkolu. Dvojitě zaslepená studie také prokázala, že bacopa zkrátila čas potřebný ke zpracování vizuálních informací.<br/><br/>Kromě zvýšení přenosu nervových signálů vědci teoretizují, že bacopa zvyšuje kognitivní funkce snížením úzkosti. Četné studie naznačují, že úzkost narušuje schopnost provádět úkoly, které vyžadují kognitivní funkce vyšší úrovně, jako je učení a zapamatování. Stres narušuje biochemické posly a zdravý přenos nervového signálu. Bacopa zmírňuje stres a obnovuje pocit klidu zvýšením hladiny acetylcholinu, což snižuje srdeční frekvenci a umožňuje vám hlouběji dýchat.<br/><br/>Doxiderol je skvělý způsob, jak získat výhody bacopa. Tento holistický doplněk obsahuje také další přírodní složky, které podporují zdraví mozku a podporují vaši schopnost soustředit se a soustředit se na složité úkoly a pamatovat si informace. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Dokáže také cítit démonické aury, stejně jako zlé aury. Když se však narodila a vyrůstala, její síly byly zpečetěny a ona byla mnohem méně mocná. Od porážky toho, kdo zpečetil její síly, Kagome dosáhla svého plného potenciálu.<br/><br/>Kagome má díky fyzickému spojení schopnost očistit jed i temnotu od subjektu (živého i neživého). K tomu promítá své duchovní síly prostřednictvím své ruky.<br/><br/>Se svým plným potenciálem má Kagome schopnost vytvořit bariéru kolem sebe a rozšířit ji kolem ostatních. Je to bariéra ve tvaru kupole, která může zničit slabé démony, kteří se dostanou do kontaktu s bariérou.<br/><br/>ZLEPŠENÉ OČI<br/>Kagome má schopnost vidět věci, které jsou pro lidské oko často neviditelné: duchy, duchy, božské a zlé aury.<br/><br/>ABILITY SE ZBRANÝMI ZBRANAMI<br/>Kagome má schopnost používat luk a šípy. Byla sama vycvičena a po letech praxe její šíp zřídka míjí svou značku. Vedle toho má Kagome schopnost naplnit své šípy silami. Ona může nalít šípy s její duchovní síly, které jim umožní proniknout démonické síly, zničit kouzla, a očistit objekty. Ona může nalít svůj luk s její síly a odrazit nepřátelské útoky. Má schopnost naplnit své šípy očistnou energií, aby očistila jed, stejně jako silné, dlouho vzdálené démonické útoky. A konečně, ona má schopnost obejít ostatní se svým šípem: Pokud se její cíl stane být za bariérou nebo rukojmí, šipka může teleportovat a zasáhnout pouze její cíl.<br/><br/>Zbytek jejích schopností se stal poněkud nedůležitý, protože souvisí s cestováním v čase (přes Studnu pojídače kostí), Šikonovým klenotem, nebo její předchozí inkarnací.<br/><br/>kánonu<br/><br/>Kagome byla stažena několik dní po ukončení střední školy, ale předtím, než se studna pro pojídače kostí znovu otevřela, aby se mohla natrvalo vrátit do minulosti.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>Paměť<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Zvuk jejího jména byl jemný šepot v zadní části její mysli, jako volání tlumený větrem. Byl to zvuk vzdálené paměti, hlas, který začala zapomenout, ale zoufale přilnul ke všem stejným. Byl to hlas její matky, zkroucený v žalu její ztracené dcery. Nakonec Kagome beze stopy vyhnala. Živě si vzpomněla na ty okamžiky, na to, jak den začal, co měla k snídani a poslední věc, kterou řekla své matce. Bylo to strašlivé, ty vzpomínky, protože to bylo jako kdykoli jindy, kdy proklouzla mezi světy. Probudila se, apatická, protože mimo školu neměla žádný účel. Mohla si najít práci a ten den byla naplánována na rozhovor. Její srdce v tom nebylo, ale bylo to to, co potřebovala udělat.<br/><br/>Vzpomněla si na ten pocit strachu, nasávala ho a dala si povzbuzující řeč, že by to mohla udělat. Že by mohla pokročit v životě, který měla nyní, když se věci urovnaly v minulosti. Samozřejmě, že měla pocit, že už nepatří do svého vlastního času nebo vlastního života. Ne se vším, co po sobě zanechala.<br/><br/>Kagome si vzpomněla na pocit dřeva pod prsty, na to, jak se její ruka stočila do rukojeti, aby otevřela dveře. Vzpomněla si, že se odmlčela, obrátila se k matce s jasným a živým úsměvem, když se otřásla ze své strnulosti. "Odcházím." Vzpomněla si, jak silný její hlas zněl, úsměv na rtech její matky, jak její oči zářily pýchou. Její matka se rozloučila, což se nezdálo být jinak než předtím, ale váha slov se na Kagomeových ramenou nějak ustálila těžší, čím více se odrážela.<br/><br/>Krátce, myšlenky zablikal vpřed, přemýšlel, jestli její matka strach o ni, chyběl ji jako ona. Kagome mohl otevřeně přiznat, že síla její matky, její podpora pro skutečnost, že její dcera proklouzla časem tak často. Byly chvíle, kdy si myslela, že je slabá, protože nemá ženu, o kterou by se mohla opřít.<br/><br/>Vzpomněla si však, že nasbírala skromné množství síly. Vzpomněla si na posun ve vzduchu, na teplotu, která se výrazně lišila od toho, co očekávala, a mrkala na náhlé a neznámé okolí. Nebyla to svatyně její rodiny. A když se otočila, aby se vrátila, aby proklouzla dveřmi, kterými prošla, setkala se s neznámým a studeným kovem pod konečky prstů a s interiérem, který nebyl vchodem do jejího domu. Muž stál před ní, za pultem, který na ni zíral s očima tak širokýma, jako byla ona sama.<br/><br/>Alespoň ne panikařila, když se prodírala časem a dostala se do nemožných situací, alespoň si vybudovala sílu vůle, pokud šlo o podivné události. Protože to nebyl každý den někdo, kdo byl vtažen do minulosti démonem, který chtěl vytrhnout mocný klenot z jejich těla, o kterém ani nevěděli, že tam je. A pak tu byla skutečnost, že roztříštila řekl mocný klenot do kdo ví, kolik kusů a byl pověřen, aby je najít. Takové věci nebyly normální, a ona potřebovala čtverec se s ním, jakmile si uvědomila, že to byla její realita. Zdálo se to tak jednoduché, jen shromáždit střepy a opravit klenot.<br/><br/>Ale nebylo to snadné, bylo tam mnoho démonů po střepech a klenotu samotném a jeden obzvláště mocný démon s přáním, že byl odhodlán vidět splněno. Dodnes se jeho přání nikdy nenaučila, ale věděla, že mu nebylo nikdy vyhověno, ani když měl tu zatracenou věc hotovou. Zničil tolik životů kvůli ničemu. Zničil tolik životů za tak marný úkol. Naraku byla nejtěžším nepřítelem a byla středem všeho, co se v životě její přítelkyně pokazilo.<br/><br/>Ale byla to právě ta nepředvídatelnost, ta nutnost válet se s tím, co se děje, a síla vůle, kterou získala ze svého dobrodružství, na kterou si vzpomněla, když čerpala, aby přišla s příběhem, který se vejde do okamžiku, který se nezdál příliš rozmarný nebo příliš přitažlivý. Potřebovala, aby jí věřili, aby přežila.<br/><br/>Nakonec, čelila horšímu než muž v obchodě s kamerami. Lhala zuby, aby si zachránila život.<br/><br/>"Hledal jsem práci." Nakonec to nebyla naprostá lež. Koneckonců, odešla z domu s úmyslem zúčastnit se pracovního pohovoru. Její stav oblečení by to alespoň dosvědčil. Byla to jedna z jednodušších lží, které kdy řekla.<br/><br/>A z nějakého důvodu si ji ten šílenec najal.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Kagomed se převrátila ve své posteli, když odstrčila vzdálené vzpomínky a odmítla uznat, že je opravdu vzhůru. Vydrápala se na poslední záblesky spánku a prosila, aby se vrátil a vzal ji zpět do svého objetí. Zavřela oči, ochotně usnula a setkala se pouze se vzpomínkami. Ozvěny písně zpívaly v dálce její vzpomínky, píseň, která ji často trápila, dostala stejné jméno jako ona. Hlas, který zpívala, už nepřipomínal její matku, ale hlasy dětí, se kterými si často hrála, když vyrůstala. Vyvolali vzpomínky, i když to byly roky, co začala žít, i když byla v tomto životě šťastná, volání těchto vzpomínek bylo příliš hlasité.<br/><br/>Najednou se do nich znovu propadla a znovu se jí vyhýbala. Pozorovala se v objetí své rodiny, zatímco Inuyasha byla vtažena zpět do studny a vypadala tak vyděšeně, jak se cítila. Vzpomínky na ten okamžik, ty pocity, byly stále tak silné. Pocit zlomeného srdce a smutku se znovu vynořil, i když to bylo tak dlouho, co se cítila, jako by byla odtržena od všeho, na čem jí záleželo.<br/><br/>Samozřejmě, že na její rodině záleželo, a byla ráda, že je zase v jejich náručí. Nikdy nedokázala úplně, opravdu popsat, jak se v těch dnech cítila. Stále nedokázala vysvětlit, jak se cítila rozdělená na dvě části, s válčícími touhami být jak v minulosti, tak v přítomnosti. Vzpomněla si na marné pokusy skočit do studny, prsty drápaly na zem v zoufalé prosbě, aby se mohla vrátit. První měsíc doma nespala tolik, jako plakala.<br/><br/>Elysion zapříčinila podobnou reakci, i když to nebylo tak divoké, protože nevěděla, kde přesně proklouzla, ani nevěděla, kde se může vrátit zpět. Její zkoumání bylo jemné mezi prací a snahou usadit se v tomto životě. Neměla v úmyslu zůstat, neměla v úmyslu zůstat déle, než potřebovala. A i když se nesnažila tak zuřivě, jako když se snažila vrátit do minulosti, její vášeň byla desetinásobná, protože neměla žádné vazby na tento svět, protože byla opravdu sama... bez naděje, že by se k ní někdo dostal.<br/><br/>Ve svých iracionálních okamžicích si myslela, že ji Klenot stáhl zpět a našel pro ni nové peklo, ve kterém by mohla žít. Nové peklo, které by ji přinutilo si něco přát, ale velmi jasně si vzpomněla, že si přála, aby to navždy zmizelo. To nezastavilo její sny, časy, kdy se probudila v noci vzlykání A ty vzpomínky z její minulosti byly nejtěžší řešit, nejtěžší zapomenout. Její srdce začalo závodit v panice, když se otočila v posteli znovu, její dech se stal bojem, když bojovala proti panickému záchvatu vyvolanému její bloudící myslí tak pozdě do noci.<br/><br/>Nenáviděla, když se cítila tak slabá, tak vyděšená.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Kagome se konečně vytáhla z postele, její pokoj byl osvětlen bledým světlem, které jí stačilo na to, aby ji dovedlo do koupelny. Stála před zrcadlem, umyvadlo běželo, zatímco se dívala na svůj odraz. Raven barvené vlasy pokryly její tvář a cítila se tak špatně, jak vypadala. Její první ráno v Elysion bylo podobné, jen byla v horším stavu.<br/><br/>Našla si místo na spaní a podařilo se jí vypracovat dohodu s majitelem budovy, aby mohla zůstat na malou dobu bez placení. Možná to byl Miroku vliv, který jí umožnil uzavřít takové dohody, protože mnich byl známý pro svou cestu v okouzlujících (nebo podvodných) lidí, aby jim dal více než dost pro práci, kterou udělali. Mnich byl vždy takový, protože se poprvé setkali. Tvrdil, že obydlí pána bude strašit, když to nebylo, nebo tvrdil, že byli vystaveni útoku, když by nebyli. Prodával své svěřence a kouzla za tak vysoké ceny. Fungovalo to prakticky pokaždé a ona se divila, proč mu lidé tak ochotně věřili.<br/><br/>Možná to byl jeho úsměv, nebo skutečnost, že byl mnichem, který lidé minulosti byli tak ochotni se rozpadat. Vždy dělal to, co bylo správné, a byl pro ni symbolem síly v době, kdy prosazoval všechno, aby udělal to, co bylo správné. Protlačil se přes to, že umírá, že je prokletý, a snažil se s tím něco udělat, než aby se válel ve svém osudu. Protlačil se až na hranici času, který vedl k jejich konečnému boji. A byla ráda, že Naraku porazili dřív, než se mohl stát předmětem stejného osudu jako jeho otec a jeho otec před ním.<br/><br/>Pokud jde o její vlastní kouzlo, byla však spravedlivější než její přítel a učinila dohodu rozumnou. Pochybovala, že by někdo na tomto světě zaplatil těžkou cenu za exorcismus nebo vyhánění démonů. Na to byli příliš technologicky pokročilí. Ale byla dost chytrá a dost chytrá na to, aby udělala dobrou dohodu.<br/><br/>Ale teď byla Kagome na lepším místě, i když její výraz vypadal stejně. Strašidelná, unavená, vyčerpaná...<br/><br/>Krátký pohled na hodiny na zdi jí řekl, že by se mohla pokusit spát déle. Ale rozhodla se z toho, že nechce znovu čelit vzpomínkám. Místo toho se osprchovala studenou vodou, aby zahnala své démony, naplnila si plíce ostrým nádechem a přinutila se probudit.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Nefungovalo to.<br/><br/>Ne tak, jak to chtěla. Studená voda určitě přinutila vzduch do plic, nutila její mysl, aby se probudila a svaly, aby se zmocnily. Hořký smích byl vytažen ze rtů, když naklonila hlavu a zjistila, že si pamatuje více. Dnes se jim nechtěla tak snadno vyhnout, nechtěla se tak jednoduše zotavit jen proto, že to chtěla.<br/><br/>Někdy se nevyhneš myšlenkám, které jsi chtěla, i když sis byla jistá, že jsi je minula.<br/><br/>Sango by v této situaci bylo velkou pomocí. Přemožitelka démonů byla její nejlepší přítel, dokonce by zašla tak daleko, že by ji nazvala sestrou, kterou nikdy neměla. Starší sestra, která byla moudrá, měla vždy svou stranu, když nastaly potíže. Obzvláště chlapec problémy, když takové věci byly spíše triviální, ale bylo zábavné mít zamilovanost a pro její přítel být naštvaný na její účet, když Inuyasha ji smutný. Vždyť to bývalo často, že polodémon běžel k boku svého mrtvého milence a nejednou jí zlomil srdce.<br/><br/>Ale Sango ji inspiroval i jinými způsoby. Po tom všem, co žena čelila, byla vždy tak silná, tak jistá... Dokonce i v dobách, kdy o sobě pochybovala, se vždy z toho dostala. Obdivovala, že má schopnost přežít poté, co ztratila celou svou rodinu - připomínka toho často tlačil Kagome přežít, protože ztratila všechny na tomto světě - a pak se její bratr stal pěšákem Naraku. Nebylo to snadné, nemohlo to být něco, s čím by se každý mohl setkat a jít dál. Pořád se usmívala, dokonce i s tou bolestí a připomínkami... Často byla tak jasná, dokonce i v temných časech.<br/><br/>A právě teď se chtěla naklonit na stranu starší ženy, aby se utěšila tím, že tam byla a podporovala ji. Cítila, že Sango to nějak zvládne a nabídne slova síly a porozumění. Byly to časy, jako jsou tyto, které zhoršovaly tato kouzla, neustálá připomínka, že byla bez své rodiny.<br/><br/>"Nechci být sám." Zvolala hlasitě ve své samotě, zvuk sprchy přehlušil prosbu.<br/><br/>Nebála se to přiznat.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Další hodina uklouzla, než si to uvědomila. Její kůže byla studená z vody a cítila, jako by jí v žilách tekl led. Neuvědomila si, že se začala třást, dokud její ruka nedosáhla, aby vypnula vodu a ukončila sprchu. Kagome znovu nehledala svůj vlastní pohled v zrcadle, místo toho se zabalila do ručníků a vyběhla z koupelny, nahoru po schodech a do kuchyně. Začala si připravovat lehkou snídani, bezmyšlenkovitě si pročítala poznámky na den, kdy se jídlo vařilo.<br/><br/>Její kariéra se v posledních letech opravdu rozjela. Její fotografie se objevovaly v mnoha galeriích, její jméno začalo navštěvovat mnoho rtů pro ty, kteří se zajímali o fotografii.<br/><br/>Práce, o kterou žádala z rozmaru, to všechno podnítila. Měla mnohem větší štěstí, než očekávala, že bude na tomto světě. Nikdy to štěstí, že se proklouzne zpět přes trhliny do svého vlastního světa, ale to štěstí, že se jí daří dobře. Když se otočila zpět ke kamnům, vzpomněla si na dobu, kdy se konečně vzdala návratu domů. Bylo to asi dva roky jejího života zde, protože se začala odvážit fotografovat jako více než jen koníček, ale něco, čím si mohla udělat jméno.<br/><br/>Ten den byl obzvláště příjemný, slunce bylo vysoko na obloze a ona sama zjistila, že pořídila nějaké fotografie přírodní scenérie. Malý chlapec se schoval v jedné z rostlin a ona zachytila obraz okamžiku, kdy se jeho tvář usadila v veselém, zlomyslném úsměvu chvíli předtím, než vyskočil, aby vyděsil svou kořist. Připomnělo jí to Shippoua, malou kitunu, kterou v podstatě adoptovala. I on byl odtržen od své rodiny, když se poprvé setkali. Jeho otec zabil a on byl odhodlán ho pomstít. Když byl mladý, vypadal tak zrale při svých prvních setkáních.<br/><br/>Možná to byl vliv Inuyashy, který dovolil, aby se souprava znovu chovala jako dítě, aby byla mladá a náladová, zatímco jiní byli zralejší. Nabídl jí útěchu svým vlastním způsobem a ona se snažila o něj pečovat, jako by byla její vlastní, i když byla tehdy tak mladá. Její mládí jí však nezabránilo pochopit, jak se o něj starat nebo se o něj starat jako její dítě. Její srdce se zvětšilo, když se usmál, když byl tak šťastný za svůj dar pastelky a vzal čas, aby umění. Byla tak pyšná na každou kresbu, že dokončil, že věděla, že to je, jak se matka bude cítit v takové situaci.<br/><br/>Bolest, která se jí protrhla, byla příliš velká, příliš náhlá. Chyběl jí a chtěla vidět, jak moc rostl od té doby, co byla pryč. Chybělo jí tolik...<br/><br/>Aby se ušetřila další bolesti, falešných nadějí, vzdala se a soustředila se na zlepšení sebe sama.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Snídaně chutnala nevýrazně, nudně a inspirovaně. Teprve když skončila, uvědomila si, že zapomněla na jakékoliv koření nebo chuť jídla. Bylo už příliš pozdě na to, aby si to pamatovala, protože její mysl byla příliš zaneprázdněna tím, že si pamatovala další detaily svého života, které se zjevně staly důležitějšími než její jídlo.<br/><br/>"Sedni si!"<br/><br/>Samozřejmě, nic se nestalo, když zlostně křičela na jednoho obzvláště frustrujícího klienta, který jí připomínal polovičního démona. Byl obzvláště tvrdohlavý a hrubý, chtěl, aby mu byla pořízena fotografie, než aby to přirozeně fungovalo. Můžete se pokusit přinutit divoká zvířata, aby se chovala tak, jak chcete. Ale zřídka se někomu podařilo silou. Inuyasha však nebyla tak špatná. Inuyasha se naučila dříve, než byla nucena od něj odejít. Stal se jemnějším, chápavějším, dospělejším, i když byly časy, kdy byl ještě dětinský a nafoukaný.<br/><br/>Pamatuje si, jak jí pálily tváře, ale jak se postavila na zem a vyhodila ho. Řekla mu, že odmítá pracovat pro někoho nebo s kýmkoli, kdo chce překroutit něco, co přesahuje její přirozenost, mimo její vlastní touhy.<br/><br/>Měla toho muže přirovnat spíše k Naraku než k Inuyashovi. I když její klientka neměla tak extrémní úmysly. Přinejmenším ten pocit poté byl příjemnou vzpomínkou. Svoboda vědět, že došla tak daleko, že mohla odmítnout práci, kterou nechtěla dělat, být svou vlastní osobou, která byla nezávislá na ostatních. I když o několik dní později slyšela zvěsti se slovy, která ji měla pomlouvat.<br/><br/>Spravedlivě se bránila, jako se bránila ke konci své cesty, vždyť byla jediná, která se na tomto světě mohla chránit.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Ranní světlo se začalo vkrádat do jejího domova a znovu jí připomínalo plynutí času. Opět zvažovala seznam věcí, které musí udělat, a diskutovala o tom, kde začít. Nebo, pokud by vůbec měla začít. S tím, jak den začal, nevěděla, jestli to může považovat za skvělý nápad. Bylo pochybné, že by byla úspěšná s tím, jak ztracená v sobě se stává.<br/><br/>Nechtěla zkazit svou poslední práci, protože to udělala při několika příležitostech předtím. Nebylo příjemné se pokusit se zotavit z úplné katastrofy.<br/><br/>Kagome si vzpomněla na pocit, že jí z rukou vyklouzla drahá, zbrusu nová kamera. Nebyla připravena ji podporovat, protože ji právě vyndala z tašky. Část z ní křičela uvnitř. Dramatický, over-the-top, plný výkřiku, který často dělala, když byla mnohem, mnohem mladší. Když se snažila, aby to přes střední školu, zatímco hopping mezi časy. Druhá část zůstala zmrzlá na místě, zatímco se její čočka úplně roztříštila a spolu s ní se rozbil i zbytek kamery.<br/><br/>Vidět Inuyashina bratra, plného démona, stát před ní bylo to poslední, co očekávala, když se vydala ven pro své fotografie. Stál tak pyšný jako vždy, tak vysoký jako vždy, tak impozantní, jak si vzpomněla. Vůbec nevypadal vyděšeně, že by byl v úplně jiném světě, i když nikdy nebyla nejlepší ve čtení jeho mysli. Jeho jméno na rtech bylo tak silné, že si mohla pamatovat i ty nejmenší pocity jako ona. Její rty byly popraskané, její ústa byla suchá a bublající pocit úzkosti v žaludku způsobil, že se cítila špatně.<br/><br/>Nechtěla, aby její naděje byly vzhůru.<br/><br/>Ale ona chtěla, aby tam byl, i když to nebyli přátelé. Byli spojenci, pokud vůbec něco, protože bojovali bok po boku. A něco bylo lepší než absolutně nic.<br/><br/>A Kagome měla dost rozumu na to, aby se na něj nevrhla, aby kolem něj objala ruce s úlevou, že s vědomím, že není sama, na jejím fotoaparátu už nezáleželo, když se k němu přiblížila. Vzpomněla si, že na ničem jiném nezáleželo celé dny, když s ním trávila čas, nemluvila o jejich světě, ale mluvila (nebo ona mluvila a on to prostě uznal).<br/><br/>Když se do něj přesně zamilovala... Kagome si to nepamatovala. Byla to subtilní věc, stejně jako on. Ale věděla, že ten pocit tam byl. A dal jí vědět, že není sama v tom, že padla, že pocity nějak kvetly.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>Pocit beztíže ji předběhl a náhle se jí otevřely oči, zatímco se její mysl zoufale drápala po poslední věci, kterou dělala. Nevzpomněla si, kdy usnula na gauči, ale věděla, že poslední místo, kde byla, bylo na příliš pohodlných polštářích. Nebojovala však ani s beztíží, jak byla ve známém náručí. Hlava se jí naklonila proti prsou Sesshoumaru, utěšoval ji tím, že je tady a ona není sama.<br/><br/>"Vítejte zpátky." Jeho odpověď byla v uznání. Nepotřeboval moc mluvit, aby pochopila jeho záměr, nebo zbytek toho, co musel říct.<br/><br/>Odnesl ji zpátky do postele, usadil ji do ní s lehkostí. Její oči se setkaly s jeho a ona se snadno usmála, protože žádné další vzpomínky se nevrátily, žádné další vzpomínky se na ni nedívaly. Ne, kdykoli byl blízko, nikdy se do těchto myšlenek nevrátila. Pomohl, a ty roky pomohly, dnešek byl prostě... jedním z těch dnů.<br/><br/>"Spi." Poručil s lehkostí, její oči se otočily na něj, ale ona nebojovala, protože byla unavená. Její ruka pevně přilnula k němu, zatímco cítila jeho opačnou ruku tisk na čelo v hodnocení její pohody.<br/><br/>"Jsem v pořádku," řekla, její slova pevná s jejím slibem.<br/><br/>Byla v pořádku, byla naživu a byla šťastná.<br/><br/>Aha.<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>Shrnutí<br/><br/>Kagome, v jednom okamžiku svého života, byla poměrně pravidelná dospívající dívka, dokud nebyla napadena démonem v domě studny své rodiny. Démon ji táhl dolů do studny, která ji magicky přenesla asi 500 let do minulosti. Tam se dozvěděla, že v jejím těle byl zapouzdřený posvátný klenot, protože byla reinkarnací kněžky, která zemřela 50 let před tím, než do ní byla vtažena. Klenot byl vyrván z jejího těla a démon, který ji táhl časem, byl poražen polovičním démonem, kterého osvobodila, který byl přišpendlen ke stromu. Kagome se spřátelila s polovičním démonem Inuyashou a cestovala s ním, aby obnovila klenot, který ona sama rozbila. Ačkoli to nebylo tak jednoduché a snadné udělat tolik démonů a lidí, kteří hledali klenot pro své vlastní účely. Spřátelila se s mladým démonem kicune, mnichem a zabijákem démonů, kteří všichni cestovali s ní, aby obnovili klenot.<br/><br/>Její skupina však nebyla ta, která šperk dokončila, ale zlý poloviční démon, který zmanipuloval většinu hlavních událostí ve většině životů jejího společníka. Když konečně nashromáždil všechny kousky klenotu a splnil své přání na zkaženém předmětu, Kagome byla vtažena do samotného klenotu s úmyslem, aby si sobecky přála udržet ji uvězněnou uvnitř navždy a udržet klenot naživu. Byla to tvrdohlavost Inuyasha, která ji zachránila před temnotou. Nakonec se vrátila do svého přirozeného času, dokončila střední školu, jak se očekávalo od dívky její časové osy. I když dny později Kagome skončil v Elysion. Je na tomto světě už pět let a už se dávno vzdala návratu domů, šťastně se usadila ve svém novém životě.<br/><br/>platonický<br/><br/>Pro Kagome je poměrně snadné najít nové přátele, od mládí se příliš nezměnila. Je to veselá mladá žena, která je empatická a přívětivá k většině ve svém životě. V mládí se spřátelila s démony, když se jich většina bála. Dokonce i démoni, kteří jedli lidi, se spřátelila a změnila své způsoby (ráda by přemýšlela). Je opravdu snadné stát se její přítelkyní, pokud je někdo schopen ukázat, že je ochoten být vykoupen, nebo ukázat, že není úplně zlý. Cítí se velmi pro každého, koho potká, takže je pro ni těžké, aby nebyla přitahována k ostatním v touze být přáteli.<br/><br/>antagonistické<br/><br/>Jediný způsob, jak získat Kagome hněv je být tak žalostný, tak zlý, a tak daleko za vykoupení, že nevidí nic dobrého ve vás. A ona může vidět dobro v téměř každý a všechno. Upřímně řečeno, s kým se setkala? Půl-démon, který proti sobě postavil dva milence, který proklel celou mužskou linii jednoho z jejích přátel, a pak nechal bratra její nejlepší kamarádky zabít jejich rodinu... Ale klidně to zkus.<br/><br/>romantické<br/><br/>Když je zamilovaná, Kagome je silnou oporou, vždy tam zůstává, i když to může být těžké. Kagome však nehledá lásku, nehledala lásku, když přišla, takže žádné minulé vztahy neexistují. To neznamená, že se do ní někdo nezamiloval. Určitě může být předmětem něčí neopětované lásky, ale pravděpodobně o tom nebude vědět. Nakonec je Kagome v současné době překvapivě zasnoubená se Sesshoumaru. Jsem naprosto otevřený potenciálním věcem. :3<br/><br/>fandom peklo<br/><br/>věk prastarý<br/><br/>druh prostor královna<br/><br/>Okupační umírání<br/><br/>Dává přednost jí/jí<br/><br/>ocenění<br/><br/>pro ona / její est 62woo i sát na plot odpovědi. ale ok stejně !!! neptune je velmi přátelský a má, že 'cool' persona, je to opravdu zábava být kolem, a on je SUPER dobré pracovat s. jako by byl super trpělivý a udělá všechno, co po něm chce - je s ním opravdu snadné pracovat, rozhodně ve srovnání s jinými modely. takže se mi líbí představa, že jsou nejprve všichni přátelé orientovaní na práci a pak se změní na něco víc.

Líbí se mi tvůj nápad, jak Kagome fotí Elsu! Víte, ona je také zpěvačka / performer v místním divadle, takže si dokážu představit, že Kagome tam jít, aby se věci rozsáhle a pak chytit Elsa zákulisí nebo tak něco - a pak přátelství by mohlo vykvést odtamtud!

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Proč byste měli být na Twitteru<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Nejsem a nikdy jsem netvrdil, že jsem guru sociálních médií. Jsem jen člověk, který hodně přemýšlí o věcech, a to se objevilo několikrát.<br/><br/>Nejsem raný osvojitel. Někdy mi trvá roky, než zjistím, na co chci něco použít, než se na to skutečně dostanu, a Twitter byl jednou z těch věcí. Jsem na Twitteru vážně od února tohoto roku, takže jsem v tom docela nový. Přesto jsem se naučil řadu věcí a chtěl jsem se o ně podělit. Někteří lidé říkají, že jsem Twitter pusher, a já jsem, protože existuje spousta dobrých důvodů, proč se na to dostat, a prakticky žádné nevýhody.<br/><br/>Takže co je Twitter? Pokud jste na internetu, pravděpodobně jste o něm alespoň slyšeli. Je to sociální síť, která slouží jako fórum pro rozhovory, aktualizace a zprávy v médiích, které jsou více veřejné než něco jako Facebook nebo LinkedIn. Facebook je o tom, kdo vás chce najít, ale Twitter je o tom, koho chcete najít. Vaši oblíbení spisovatelé, herci, politici, zpěváci a vědci jsou pravděpodobně na Twitteru. Stejně tak jsou vaše oblíbené charity, rozhlasové stanice, zpravodajské stránky a obchody. A chtějí, abyste je našli a poslouchali, co říkají. Každý na Twitteru, alespoň zpočátku, s vámi chce mluvit.<br/><br/>Ale proč se k tomu připojit? Proč být toho součástí? Existuje mnoho důvodů, a já vám dám pár.<br/><br/>Lidé a místa Twitter je skvělý způsob, jak se dozvědět o událostech, které se dějí po celém světě, ale také ve vaší komunitě. Pokud cestujete a hledáte věci, které máte dělat, je to skvělý způsob, jak zjistit věci, které se týkají vašich zájmů (protože lidé, které sledujete, jsou lidé, o které máte zájem). I když necestujete, víte o skvělých místech, kam jít lokálně, nebo víte, že lidé, o které máte zájem, se k nim chystají, vytváří příležitost setkat se s nimi a vytvořit s nimi hlubší vztah. Pokud se vrátíte na můj stranický post, všichni lidé v něm, ale dva, slyšel jsem o Twitteru a pak jsem se setkal v reálném životě, a teď jsme docela dobří přátelé. A čím více to uděláte, tím více věcí se dozvíte a tím více lidí se setkáte. A pokud je sledujete na Twitteru, už víte něco o tom, jaké jsou. Chtějí, abyste to udělali. Opak je také pravdivý, protože tweetování zve lidi, aby viděli, jaké jste, a mohou o vás dělat stejná rozhodnutí.<br/><br/>Inspirace a motivace<br/>Inspirace přichází z nejpodivnějších míst a příliv tweetů znamená, že je vždy čerstvý obsah pro vaši představivost. Mám první politiku, takže budu sledovat téměř každého a pak pravidelně procházet a sledovat lidi. Nevím, kdo ve mně zasadí zárodek nového příspěvku na blogu nebo nového projektu, takže si rád nechám své možnosti otevřené. Motivace se také stává, protože Twitter je jako život. Pokud se obklopíte lidmi, kteří jsou ambiciózní, oddaní, velkorysí a pracovití, je jednodušší být takový a tlačit se. Je jednodušší si myslet, že když mohou plánovat události, spouštět projekty, nebo prostě ráno vstávat, tak můžete i vy.<br/><br/>Blogeři o učení a životním stylu jsou na Twitteru. Blogeři, kteří nejsou, mohou být ve skutečnosti šílení. A lidé blogují téměř o všem. Pokud se chcete něco naučit, je pravděpodobné, že o tom někdo tweetuje. Kromě toho, zpravodajské služby a obchody jsou také připojeny, což znamená, že můžete dostat své zprávy až do minuty, a dozvědět se o prodejích a obchodech, jak začnou. Pokud jde o životní styl, hledají nové nápady recept? Sledujte některé cateringové společnosti a podívejte se, s čím přicházejí. Potřebujete zvrat pro tuto koktejlovou párty? Twitter má také lidi. Doporučení ve skříni, nebo jen chcete vidět, co dělají ostatní lidé se svými životy? Je to všechno tam.<br/><br/>Když o tom mluvím, čelím některým běžným výzvám a jsou to legitimní překážky. Může se to zdát docela skličující, zvláště pokud se dostanete do rozjetého vlaku pozdě, jako jsem to udělal já. Strávil jsem měsíce sledováním pouze dvou lidí a nevěděl jsem, co jiného dělat. Ale existují způsoby, jak je překonat, a slyšet, že jsou od nejméně časté až po většinu.<br/><br/># 3: Twitter je pro narcistické blbce<br/>Myslím, že to vychází z myšlenky, že většina lidí tweetuje pro sebe a o sobě jako způsob, jak získat pozornost. Co nechápu, je, proč je na tom něco špatného, nebo proč to dělá narcista nebo blbec. Pokud má někdo co říct, chce být slyšen. Bývalo by to, že byste stáli na rohu ulice a křičeli. Nyní můžete křičet 140 znaků nebo méně. Twitter je jen nový způsob, jak být slyšen. Na Twitteru jsou určitě narcističtí blbci. Někdy jsou lidi pitomci, někdy jsem jedním z nich já, je mi líto, že to musím říct. Pokud se vám nelíbí, co někdo říká, ať už to jsou body, které dělají, nebo podrobné účty jejich koupelnových aktivit, nemusíte poslouchat na Twitteru.<br/><br/>#2 Nedokážu si to všechno vynachválit<br/>Druhou překážkou, kterou lidé často vyvolávají, je to, že prostě nemají čas sledovat všechny věci, které se dějí na Twitteru. A víte co? To je v pořádku. Mějte přehled o tom, co můžete. Možná se jen každých pár dní bloudíte. Pokud jste soukromý uživatel (spíše než tweetování pro vaši společnost), a zejména začátečník, je to v pořádku. Část něčeho je lepší než nic.<br/><br/>#1 Nemám nic, co bych tam chtěla dát<br/>To je zdaleka nejčastější výzva, kterou lidé zvyšují. A to ani nevadí. Nemusíte se připojit k Twitteru, abyste mohli mluvit. Přidejte se k němu, abyste poslouchali. Opět zde jsou vaši oblíbení autoři, zpěváci, blogeři a noviny. Tohle je vaše šance si je poslechnout. Je to vaše šance získat okno do jejich životů a aktivit, a oni vás k tomu zvou. Chcete zjistit, co Felicia Day chystá na San Diego Comic Con? Hotovo. Znám lidi, kteří poslouchají pouze na Twitteru, a to je skvělé. To je to, co jsem udělal na chvíli. Nakonec možná najdete něco, o čem můžete tweetovat, nebo něco tweetovat. Doufám, že ano, protože o tom chci slyšet.<br/><br/>Stručně řečeno, pokud nepoužíváte Twitter, myslím, že byste měli být. Pokud jej nepoužíváte v plném rozsahu, zkuste to. Nebojte se sledovat pět set lidí, pokud všichni tito lidé říkají věci, které vás zajímají. Pozvěte tyto lidi do kousků vašeho života a uvidíte, jak se zlepší interakcí. Těším se na vás. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Kořenové kanály<br/><br/>Samotná myšlenka na získání kořenového kanálku staví většinu lidí na okraj. SCM Dental využívá nejnovější technologie a techniky, aby se kořenový kanál prakticky bez bolesti a nízkého stresu.<br/><br/>Rotační endodoncie je pokročilá technologie a technika pro provádění endodontické léčby, klinický termín pro kořenový kanál. Termín "kořenový kanál" se vztahuje k přirozené dutině ve středu zubu. Zubní nerv se nachází v měkké tkáni (dřevě) uvnitř kořenového kanálku. Pokud je zub poškozen traumatem nebo kazem, mohou nečistoty vstoupit do citlivé oblasti kořenového kanálku a způsobit infekci nebo za extrémních okolností a absces. Abscesovaný zub je velmi vážný a měl by být považován za nouzový, protože může vytvořit infekci, která se může rozšířit do jiných částí těla. Pokud si myslíte, že máte abscesovaný zub, okamžitě kontaktujte naši kancelář a naplánujte pohotovostní péči.<br/><br/>V závislosti na případu, léčba kořenových kanálků může vyžadovat více než jednu návštěvu. Počáteční X-ray bude přijata k vyhodnocení zubu a kořenového kanálku a určit rozsah poškození a infekce, pokud je přítomen. Dostanete formu anestezie, která vás uvolní.<br/><br/>Když je oblast necitlivá, náš zubní lékař vytvoří přístupovou komoru k kořenovému kanálku pomocí elektrického násadce. Dále bude kořenový kanál oškrábán o infikovanou nebo poškozenou tkáň a nerv. Jakmile je celá oblast důkladně vyčištěna a vyleštěna, zub bude naplněn biokompatibilní gumovou sloučeninou zvanou guta percha. Zub je pak pokryt zubní výplní nebo zubní korunkou, aby se obnovila síla a funkce.<br/><br/>Endodontická terapie má špatnou pověst jako bolestivá procedura. Při rotační endodoncii není procedura kořenového kanálku bolestivější než umístění zubní výplně. Infekce a poškození nervu je to, co vytváří extrémní bolest a nepohodlí a pacienti zažijí výraznou úlevu po absolvování terapie kořenových kanálků. Kořenové kanálky mají úspěšnost 95% a umožňují lidem zachovat si své přirozené zuby. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kostelní Dno Dřevo<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Dřevo na dně kostela, Highgate<br/><br/>Název: Queen's Wood<br/><br/>V letech 1860 až 1880 bylo centrum vytrženo z City of London, aby zde bylo vybudováno kanalizace, železnice a nové silnice. Domy byly zbourány bez ohledu na nájemníky, kteří museli najít jakékoli ubytování, které mohli jinde. Manažeři šli na livo v Kensingtonu a St. John's Wood, zatímco ti nejchudší se nacpali do rookeries jako Seven Dials a Lisson Grove. Pro ty mezi, úředníci a kvalifikovaní dělníci, spekulativní stavitelé postavili řadu za řadou řadových vil a pan Pooter se přestěhoval do Holloway. Lidé z Muswell Hill sledovali, jak se domy plíží přes pole Finsbury Parku, nahoru do Crouch Hillu a dolů na druhou stranu, takže do roku 1880 se vyvíjel Crouch End a zdálo se, že neexistuje žádný způsob, jak zastavit tok. O deset let později byly prodány velké pozemky Muswell Hill. Upton Farm byl prodán a církevní komisaři chtěli vyvinout Churchyard Bottom Wood, nyní nazvaný Queen's Wood. Příběh by byl Ibsenovou hrou. Dvě skupiny poctivých, vysoce motivovaných lidí bojujících za to, co si každý myslel, že je správné. Církevní komisaři na jedné straně a výbor Hornsey Charities na straně druhé, oba věřili, že dělají to nejlepší pro ostatní lidi, a veřejnost proti nim povstala v rozhořčení.<br/><br/>V té době Muswell Hill Road byla venkovská silnice, s Southwood Hall na jednom konci a Upton Farm na druhém. 1894, Onslow Gardens byl postaven, Connaught Gardens vyznačena, a stavitelé byli připraveni rozvíjet Woodlands panství. Vyříznuto z Churchyard Bottom Wood byla skupina spadlých chalup, na trojúhelníkovém místě. Nedatovaná mapa, kterou drží církevní komisaři, ukazuje šest chatek Wasteland s otvorem mezi nimi - ne silnice, ne zmetená, ale cesta k jahodovým záhonům za nimi. Dále byla další mezera, která vedla k pěšinkám přes dřevo. Tyto dva otvory měly být základem plánu. Stejné dvě mezery a vyčištěná půda, která byla jahodovým polem, lze vidět na níže uvedené mapě z roku 1894. Jsou zobrazeny jako "Muswell Hill Cottages" a docela mimochodem, Peter Sellers měl žít na stejném místě mnohem později. Pro rozvoj dřeva jako sídliště potřebovali komisaři projet dvě silnice z Muswell Hill Road a postavit podél nich domy. Samotná fasáda Muswell Hill Road by neposkytla dostatek domů, aby se podnik vyplatil.<br/><br/>Pozemky a chalupy byly dány mnohem dříve jako almužny pro staré lidi a byly drženy jejich jménem správci Hornsey Charity Commissioners. Veřejnost, která si přála udělat pro své staré nájemníky to nejlepší, je nemohla zlepšit, protože neměli peníze. Několik let předtím, než církevní komisaři plánovali vybudovat štěrk (nyní Highgate Wood) jako sídliště, ale to se setkalo s takovou opozicí, že ustoupili. Místo toho v roce 1886 dali veřejnosti všech 69 akrů lesa. Zároveň nabídli, že prodají Churchyard Bottom Wood městské radě Hornsey za 25 000 liber, ale to bylo pro Hornseyho příliš na to, aby se sám zvýšil. Rada řekla, že lidé žijící mimo Hornsey také těšili dřevo a další orgány by měly pomoci, ale žádná pomoc nebyla poskytnuta. Nakonec nabídka upadla do opovržení.<br/><br/>Mapa zobrazující Muswell Hill Cottages, které byly centrem kontroverze.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road kolem roku 1880<br/><br/>Zdá se pravděpodobné, že tyto tři páry chalup byly ty, které byly v centru sporu.<br/><br/>Církevní komisaři chtěli získat peníze na svou církevní práci v Británii i v zahraničí. Domnívali se, že jim byla dána půda pro propagaci náboženství, a pokud to znamenalo prodej půdy nebo lesů, bylo to menší zlo než omezení práce církve. Dávali veřejnosti štěrkované dřevo: na jeho místě by se rozvíjelo Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Správci Hornsey Charities chtěli získat příjem na pomoc svým chudým lidem, a tak učinili nabídku komisařům. Jejich trojúhelníkový kus půdy byl příliš nešikovně tvarovaný, aby byl ekonomicky rozvinutý, ale pokud by jim komisaři poskytli více půdy, aby se z ní stalo čtvercové místo, postavili by dvacet pět úhledných vil. Ty by přinesly nájemné za půdu ve výši 225 EUR ročně, které by mohly být použity k úlevě od chudoby lidí v Hornsey. Na oplátku by umožnily Komisi proříznout dvě silnice přes jejich zemi, aby komisaři mohli rozvíjet lesy.<br/><br/>Když se tato nabídka stala známou, lidé okamžitě reagovali s poplachem.<br/><br/>Dne 16. prosince 1893 se poslanec Carvell Williams v Dolní sněmovně zeptal, zda církevní komisaři souhlasili s prodejem pásu půdy Hornsey Charities Trustees pod podmínkou, že stávající silnice bude rozšířena na 40 stop, zda se jedná o předběžný stavební plán a zda bude mít sněmovna parlamentu možnost vyjádřit svůj názor.<br/><br/>Pan Leveson Gower, církevní komisař, odpověděl: "Ano" na první část.<br/><br/>Pan Carvell Williams, "Chápu, že je záměrem zničit tuto část Highgate Woods tím, že na ní buduje?"<br/><br/>O dva dny později The Star publikoval článek hodný každého moderního bulváru.<br/><br/>Hvězda<br/>18. prosince 1893<br/><br/>"Parlament musí bedlivě sledovat staré vandaly a konfederace církevních komisařů, kteří si vždy odcizují nějaký kus půdy nebo zvýhodňují stavitele na rozdíl od široké veřejnosti. Komisaři by neprodávali spodní dřevo církevního dvora poplatníkům, ale nyní navrhují "otevřít ho" tím, že přes něj proříznou dvě široké silnice v souvislosti s jedním z jejich četných stavebních projektů. Nepoloží někdo v parlamentu otázku a nezkontroluje politiku komisařů v oblasti cihel a malt?“<br/><br/>V době, kdy to bylo vytištěno, byla otázka položena a odpověď byla buď nepravdivá, nebo nevyzpytatelná. The Times v dlouhé zprávě uvedly, že Comnussioners nebyli připraveni dát závazek, že Parlament, nebo jakýkoli jiný veřejný orgán, by měl mít možnost zvážit jakýkoli plán výstavby na místě dřeva.<br/><br/>Situace se vařila osmnáct měsíců, dokud nebyli církevní komisaři nuceni zahájit vyšetřování, které začalo v Highgate dne 31. května 1895, kterému předsedal asistent církevního komisaře. Vyšetřování produkoval příval novinových dopisů, z nichž to bylo nejdůležitější.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5. června 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMUS V HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Pane –<br/><br/>Jeden z nejkrásnějších kousků lesa na předměstí Londýna je ohrožen. Pomůžete nám odvrátit to, co by bylo kalamitou nejen v bezprostředním okolí, ale v celém hustě osídleném severním Londýně? V žádné části metropole nebyl stavitel aktivnější než v Crouch End a Hornsey. Krásné louky před rokem nebo dvěma jsou nyní domy a obchody. Na místo vznešených jilmů a kaštanů nastoupily balastní haldy a kdysi příjemné vesnice sdílejí osud Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury a Islington.<br/><br/>---- Objekt je výstavba dvou čtyřicet stop silnic lesem. My v této čtvrti známe význam čtyřicet stop silnic lesem. To znamená, že lesy jsou odsouzeny k zániku. Před deseti lety zachránila agitace sesterské dřevo o rozloze šedesáti pěti akrů – The Gravel Pit Woods – a nikdo, kdo viděl davy Bank Holiday, které se hrnuly po Archway Road z ponurých ulic Holloway, Islington a Clerkenwell, a sledoval horlivý požitek dětí a rodinných večírků piknikujících na trávě a mezi stromy, nemohl si uvědomit nesmírné dobrodiní, které tento církevní komisař poskytl. ----<br/><br/>Církevní komisaři vlastní téměř třetinu velké farnosti Hornsey. Liberálními výdaji peněz poplatníků na otevírání silnic a celkovým rozvojem okresu se hodnota jejich majetku enormně zvýšila a z tohoto nezaslouženého přírůstku čerpají každý rok velké příjmy. Poplatníci, jejichž peníze tak přispěly k vytvoření obrovského majetku, mohou na oplátku očekávat liberální zacházení.<br/><br/>Poslušně,<br/><br/>Podepsán vikářem svatého Jakuba, Muswell Hillem, ministrem Park Chapelem, Crouch Endem, advokátem žijícím v Onslow Gardens a třemi členy okresní rady.<br/><br/>Jejich vlastní náboženští vůdci a okresní rada, všichni ve zbrani říkají, že církev je příliš bohatá a měla by být dobročinná, ne chamtivá. Zařazení těchto dvou duchovních bylo chytrým krokem. Pamatujte si, že to bylo stále na vrcholu Darwinovy kontroverze. Darwin rozdělil víru v učení Církve a mnoho lidí by nesnášelo moc Církve pouze z tohoto hlediska. Církev nebyla tak bezpečná, jak se předstírala.<br/><br/>Večerní zprávy, 7. června 1895 řekl:<br/><br/>"Pokud se církevní komnussioners nejsou řešeny najednou, stavební chobotnice dostane stisk dřeva, které bude velmi obtížné uvolnit později, -. Proto je třeba, aby Londýňané byli vzhůru a dělali, pokud by zachránili jeden ze svých nejkrásnějších kousků rustikální scenérie. "Veřejné vyšetřování je odloženo na příští čtvrtek a do té doby musí být učiněno něco, co přesvědčí komisaře, že občané Londýna nebudou tolerovat konfiskaci jednoho ze svých oblíbených hřišť."<br/><br/>Dopis v Daily Chronicle následující den napsal:<br/><br/>.... Bylo to s velkou úlevou, že obyvatelé, asi před deseti lety, slyšel, že nákup horního dřeva bylo provedeno; a jak nádherné požehnání to ukázalo, každý, kdo je navštívil může svědčit, ale všichni, kteří se snažili zachránit tyto horní lesy, které leží na západní straně Muswell Hill silnice, cítil, že jejich vítězství bylo neúplné, pokud šedesát akrů na východní straně zůstal v nebezpečí. Je to, jak to bylo, nehoda, že lesy jsou rozděleny širokou hlavní silnici. Může někdo pochybovat o tom, jaký by to bylo, kdyby Churchyard Bottom Wood byly nahrazeny řadami malých vil, z nichž každá vysílá svůj příspěvek kouře a sazí? Může také někdo pochybovat o tom, jaký by byl velký rozdíl v malebném prostředí zakoupených lesů, kdyby se řada nových domů rozběhla přímo proti jejich listnatému průčelí?<br/><br/>To vyjadřovalo názory mnoha lidí. Ve skutečnosti Štěrkové jámové dřevo, které spisovatel nazývá "horním dřevem", nebylo zakoupeno, ale dáno okresu církevní komisí, což mělo být znovu a znovu opakováno v průběhu let, ale většina lidí to ignorovala. Komise se nehodlala vzdát druhého dřeva, ať už někdo řekl cokoli, a držela tuto pozici až do konce.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, z 5 Cranley Gardens, v dopise The Times z 8. června 1895, naléhal na nákup.<br/><br/>Vím, že je běžné mluvit tvrdě o církevních komisařích, ale jako správci fondu jsou povinni spravovat to k největšímu prospěchu, a proto, pokud je třeba něco udělat pro záchranu demolice dřeva, zdá se mi, že to může být provedeno pouze nákupem majetku od komisařů, které znám, jsou plně naživu k ochraně volných a otevřených prostorů.<br/><br/>(To se týká hřiště Crouch End, které bylo zajištěno o několik let později.)<br/><br/>Jako předseda Konzervativní asociace Muswell Hill jsem neustále v kontaktu s obyvateli a mohu bezpečně potvrdit, že každý člověk žijící v sousedství by udělal cokoliv, aby zachoval.<br/><br/>(Vše, co si osobně přál, byl příjem Charity na podporu svých chudých lidí. Požadoval svůj akr půdy - ne moc jistě - věřil ujištění komisařů, že dřevo není v nebezpečí.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road byla jednou z nejlepších v Hornsey a zůstala stejně krásná, ať už v domech nebo bez nich.<br/><br/>(A pak přišel velký rétorický rozkvět.)<br/><br/>'Mají chudí trpět kvůli sentimentálním námitkám a hysterickému křiku 'vlka, který právě vychovali vaši korespondenti? Akr půdy přidaný k charitativnímu majetku by neznamenal žádný významný rozdíl pro zbývající půdu, zatímco zisk z ní by pomohl mnoha chudým starým a zasloužilým osobám v jejich klesajících letech a umožnil nám předat našim nástupcům panství, které by v daleké budoucnosti mělo velkou hodnotu při poskytování charitativní pomoci zasloužilým chudým z farnosti Hornsey.<br/><br/>Čtením jeho dopisu člověk cítí hysterii velmi blízko povrchu. Proč si myslel, že komisaři chtěli postavit silnici? Proč by měli utrácet všechny ty peníze, ne-li stavět domy? Zdálo se, že si nikdy neuvědomil, že na jeden akr půdy bude celé dřevo ztraceno. Byl to člověk, kterému komisaři nabídli prodej za 25 000 let a je to jeho jméno, které je uctěno na pamětní desce na věži Crouch End Clock Tower za záchranu dřeva, ale jeho důvěra v církevní komisaře se zdá naivní. Je smutné, že při výslechu měl být vržen jako ďábel.<br/><br/>Vyšetřování pokračovalo<br/><br/>Odročení bylo otevřeno v Highgate dne 15. června 1895. Očekávalo se velké shromáždění, Koncilní komora byla zcela změněna. Obvyklé stoly byly odstraněny a místnost naplněna židlemi. V půl sedmé byla místnost přeplněná, lidé se potáceli po sedadlech.<br/><br/>Pan Murray, komisař, řekl, že vyšetřování bylo opravdu jednoduché. Hornsey Parochial Charities si přál koupit pozemek, který sousedí s jejich charitativním majetkem vzadu. Otázka zněla, zda Charitativní komise, která ovládala všechny charity, měla dost síly na to, aby je zastavila. Církevní komisaři byli připraveni prodat pozemky za velmi výhodných podmínek a příjem Charity by se velmi výrazně zvýšil.<br/><br/>Proti tomu byly tři třídy námitek.<br/><br/>Původní trust byl určen k poskytování chat pro chudé, ale správci navrhovali postavit vily, které by byly příliš drahé pro chudé. Nicméně, to bylo v pravomoci správců měnit podmínky Trust, takže by mohli stavět vily, pokud si mysleli, že chudí by nakonec prospěch. Sami chudí by mohli namítat, ale liberální ustanovení jim již byla přislíbena. Třetí námitka se týkala estetické a veřejné stránky otázky. Převzal z toho, co četl, že Charitativní komise by měla zasahovat, aby zabránila církevním komisařům vykonávat svou vlastní diskrétnost při nakládání s vlastním majetkem.<br/><br/>Vyšetřování se zabývalo dobrými body, ale řečníci se stále vraceli k hlavnímu problému, jak zabránit zničení dřeva. Vestrický úředník z Islingtonu, který zastupoval 300 000 lidí, formálně protestoval proti jakékoli části dřeva, která je tak cenná pro lidi z Islingtonu a Hornsey, kteří jsou používáni pro soukromé účely. Wilfred White řekl, že pokud by jim komisaři dali čas, mohli by získat peníze na kompenzaci správců.<br/><br/>Pan Beaumont řekl, že nechtějí vily, chtějí chalupy pro chudé lidi, kteří byli vyhnáni z okresu. Jiní říkali, že nebyly žádné peníze na výstavbu chat, které by nahradily současné zchátralé, ale vily by byly ekonomickým návrhem. Jiní odpověděli, že existuje spousta vil, které by mohli pronajímat Highgate. Dřevo bylo posvátné. Držte se otázky dřeva.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher řekl, že křik mezi pracujícími byl, že není kam jít. Pracující lidé za ním přišli s křikem, "Jsme vyhnáni z Highgate a jsou povinni jít do Highgate New Town." Bylo-li prodáno průčelí Muswell Hill Road, nebylo pochyb o tom, že silnice by mohly být proříznuty přímo lesem směrem k Hornsey, ale pokud komisaři nemohli získat půdu od Charitativní komise, nemohli proříznout silnici.<br/><br/>Byl si velmi jistý, že chalupy by mohly být ve stavu opravy. Požádali ho chudí lidé, policie a řada dělnických tříd, aby zastupoval tyto dva body, že chatové ubytování bylo ve Highgate velmi potřebné a že pokud by jednou dovolili, aby se půda prodala, nedalo by se říci, kde by ruka stavitele zůstala.<br/><br/>(Hlasité a dlouhé chvalozpěvy).<br/><br/>Mluvilo mnoho jiných lidí a Komnussioner shrnul, že se domnívá, že převládající názor byl ve prospěch zachování chaty, ale setkání by mělo vyvodit žádné závěry z toho, co řekl (Groans).<br/><br/>Jiní říkali, že správci Charity nesplnili své povinnosti tím, že nechali chaty chátrat.<br/><br/>Pan H.R. Williams, správce, který dříve napsal do novin, řekl, že má nejlepší autoritu, že církevní komisaři nebudou dělat žádné silnice a nebudou mít prospěch z jednání komisařů charity. Jiní byli mnohem méně důvěřiví a shromáždění skončilo po téměř třech hodinách.<br/><br/>"Čelíme skutečnosti, že v Highgate a Muswell Hill je řada lidí, kteří chtějí Churchyard Bottom Wood a nebudou šťastní, dokud ho nemají - zatímco se zdá, že nikdo není ochoten utratit za to halíř. Každý říká, že by bylo hezké mít dřevo jako otevřený prostor, ale každý si myslí, že je povinností někoho jiného, aby to udělal. Islington Vestry se "rozhodl" na toto téma, ale Islington Vestry nenabízí ani halíř k nákupu. Neexistuje žádný obtížnější problém, který by komunita nebo jednotlivec vyřešili, než jak získat majetek jiných lidí, aniž by za něj zaplatili.<br/><br/>Zaplatit za to byl skutečně problém, protože Churchyard Bottom Wood se stal předmětem intenzivní místní a národní debaty. Byl vytvořen společný výbor, aby získal peníze na záchranu dřeva. Dne 20. listopadu 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon pokladník, napsal do Standard, denní noviny v té době, apelovat na pomoc. Připomněl všem nebezpečí ztráty dřeva a řekl, že to může být ušetřen pouze tím, že ji koupí. Církevní komisaři by prodali za 25,000 liber a navíc (5,000 by bylo zapotřebí na oplocení a odvodnění, což by činilo celkem 30 000 liber. To bylo příliš mnoho pro Hornseyovu radu, ale již hlasovali 10 000 liber proti celkové částce. Lesy měly neocenitelnou hodnotu pro celý severní Londýn, a tak apeloval na veřejné orgány a soukromé osoby, aby zvýšily zbývajících 20 000 liber. Varoval, že současná nabídka od církevních komisařů je otevřena až do konce roku 1898. Poté se stavitelé nastěhují.<br/><br/>Odvolání bylo tiskem vřele přivítáno. Soukromý návrh zákona prošel parlamentem a Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, se stal zákonem. Conunittee nyní měla právo inzerovat příspěvky na nákup dřeva a jeho zachování.<br/><br/>Za poměrně krátkou dobu byly získány téměř všechny peníze, ale posledních několik tisíc se ukázalo jako velmi obtížné a lhůta pro komisaře byla otázkou týdnů. Cory-Wright napsal prosby o více času, ale bylo mu uděleno pouhé tři měsíce a pak pouze tehdy, pokud byl zaplacen úrok ve výši 4 procenta za další období z celé částky. Nakonec London County Council, která původně nabízela 2500 liber, vydělala až 5 000 liber a celkem bylo dosaženo, ale byla to blízká věc.<br/><br/>Rada se rozhodla přejmenovat dřevo na "Královnin les" na počest diamantového jubilea královny Viktorie a Hornseyho, když vévodkyně z Albany formálně prohlásila dřevo za otevřené "pro svobodné použití veřejností navždy".<br/><br/>Zatímco kampaň na záchranu Churchyard Bottom Wood byla vedena a řízena místními lidmi, kteří se vášnivě zajímali o tento konkrétní kus lesa, požádali o pomoc a zkušenosti rozsáhlou síť lidí, z nichž někteří spolupracovali na podobných kampaních více než třicet let. Výbor vydal výzvu, vytištěnou na velmi kvalitním papíře a nesoucí některá slavná jména.<br/><br/>Otázky otevřeného prostoru a veřejného zdraví byly hlavními tématy viktoriánské vize.<br/><br/>Hnutí otevřených prostorů<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, velká bytová reformátorka, která začala se třemi starými domy v Marylebone, které pro ni koupil Jolm Ruskin, se rychle stala odborníkem na bydlení chudých lidí v nejzdravějších možných podmínkách. Její způsob byl koupit nájemné a pak zničit některé z přeplněných domů, aby se světlo a vzduch na zbytek, věřit, že čerstvý vzduch a sluneční světlo byly jediný způsob, jak chudí lidé mohli být zachráněni od 'hnisavá horečka. Naučila se to jako dítě od svého dědečka, Southwood Smith, který vyvinul své teorie v nemocnici horečky na King's Cross.<br/><br/>Postavil první průmyslové obydlí pro chudé lidi a statisticky dokázal, že dobrý vzduch a slušná drenáž zachránily životy. Gibson Gardens, v Northwold Road, je přímým výsledkem nápadů Southwood Smith. Více informací o Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Důležitost otevřeného vzduchu<br/><br/>Otevřené prostory a možnost dýchat čistý vzduch, byly nezbytné pro lidi, kteří žijí v jedné nebo dvou přeplněných místnostech. Octavia Hill vzal její obvinění z Lisson Grove slumů, až Fitzjohn Avenue Hampstead Heath. Tak milovala pole Fitzjohn's Avenue, že se je snažila koupit jako veřejný park. Měly stát 10 000 liber a během tří srpnových týdnů bylo zvýšeno 8 500 liber. Stačil jen konec letních prázdnin a návrat z dovolené sympatických přátel a dalších 1 500 liber by bylo zvýšeno, ale majitelé náhle svou nabídku stáhli. Přes všechny prosby byla pole pokryta velkými domy.<br/><br/>Z toho se vyvinula kampaň na záchranu Parliament Hill, další otevřený prostor na sever od Lisson Grove, skupovat pole v cestě stavitelů, aby se trvalý kordon sanitar proti postupující cihly. Parlament Hill Fields kampaň byla tak úspěšná, že Hampstead Heath Bill byl předán a tam byly peníze z odvolání. Z těchto peněz a podnět k otevřeným prostorům, bylo rozvíjet National Trust. Octavia Hillová se roky zajímala o ochranu oblastí, jako je Church Bottom Wood, takže byla přirozeným spojencem v boji za záchranu dřeva.<br/><br/>S tímto druhem agitace a sběru peněz byla obeznámena i Spolek pro ochranu lidu. Měli strženy oplocení, když páni panství měli uzavřené kusy společné půdy, což vedlo jak legální, tak ilegální boje proti arogantní privatizaci půdy tradičně svobodné. Robert Hunter, jejich čestný advokát z roku 1868, se vždy zabýval zabezpečením otevřených prostor, velkých nebo malých, pro veřejnost. On, nyní sir Robert Hunter, se stal předsedou církve Bottom Appeal. Předsedou Dolní sněmovny byl poslanec Shaw-Lefevre (později lord Eversley), který hrál velkou roli v této a dalších kampaních v Dolní sněmovně. Octavia Hill se podílela na jejich práci asi od roku 1875.<br/><br/>Ve stejné době Octavia Hillová vedla kampaň za návrh zákona o pohřbech.<br/><br/>Městské hřbitovy se staly tak plnými a tak vážným nebezpečím pro zdraví, kontaminací studní, ze kterých lidé čerpali pitnou vodu, že městské pohřby již nebyly povoleny. Místo toho byly na okraji města vytvořeny hřbitovy. Jedním z nich byl hřbitov v Abney Parku, kde bylo hnutí za odstranění náhrobních kamenů na okrajích starých městských hřbitovů, předělání těl jinde a přeměna hřbitovů na zahrady a otevřené prostory, místo toho, aby se na nich stavělo. Tato půda v centru Londýna byla velmi cenná a spekulanti byli dychtiví ji získat: Dokonce i kvakeři postavili nad jedním ze svých cemetrií a hrozili, že to udělají znovu tím, že postaví nad Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hillová měla síť spojenců v tuctu polí, takže její pomoc při záchraně Church Bottom Wood musela být neocenitelná.<br/><br/>Společnost Metropolitan Gardens Society, založená v roce 1882, rozložila do roku 1890 asi dvě stě malých zahrad v centrech měst. Později je předala místním úřadům, takže jejich podpora pro Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal byla zajištěna od začátku.<br/><br/>Společnost Kyrle je nyní zapomenuta, ale ve své době měla velký vliv na územní plánování a legislativu otevřeného prostoru. Společnost byla založena kolem roku 1875 pro "difúzi krásy", aby vnesla barvy a zájem do života lidí žijících v nudném, nudném prostředí. Jasné barvy na stěnách a výzdobě, dobrý zpěv, otevřené prostory, příroda, literatura a umění. To vše spadá do působnosti Společnosti. Tam byl Dekorativní Branch, pro kterého William Morris přednášel; Hudební Branch na podporu sborů a Šťastné večery pro lidi v místních školních budovách; a Literatura Branch. Společnost pravidelně dopisy v The Times apelovala na "bohatší třídy", aby knihy a periodika byly distribuovány do chlapeckých a dívčích klubů, almužen a jinde. Samotné jméno "Kyrle" pochází z papežova Muže Rosse, filantropa, který dal své rodiště lidem jako veřejný park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light.

Ti nejmenší se jen učí o vzorech, mohou jednoduše odpovídat obrázkům na proužky vzorů, zatímco jiní mohou pokračovat v vzoru s obrázkovými kartami na prázdných proužcích.<br/><br/>Chcete-li vytvořit složku souboru, chcete vystřihnout mřížku obrázků, aby se kousky karet. Doporučuji je laminovat, aby jim pomohly vydržet déle. Poté přilepte proužky vzoru dolů na složku souboru.<br/><br/>Chtěl jsem mít také prázdné proužky, aby dívky viděly, kde pokračovat v vzoru a kolik jich rozložit. Připojil jsem je na stranu složky pomocí pásky, aby se mohli složit, aby zabalili hru a rozšířili rozložení vzoru.<br/><br/>Také jsem přidala další prázdná, aby si dívky mohly také vytvořit svůj vlastní vzor.<br/><br/>Turecká číselná hra<br/><br/>V této hře dívky přidávají peří do krůtího těla při cvičení počítání a rozpoznávání čísel. Použil jsem bezbarvé peří, abych působil jako průvodce, kde přidat peří a aby se dívky mohly vyrovnat číslům. A ujistěte se, že při lepení krůtího těla přilepíte pouze ve středu, aby se kusy křídel mohly sklouznout pod tělo.<br/><br/>Jakmile jsou všechna peří rozložena, cvičíme nějakou jednoduchou aritmetiku, jako je odebrání tří peří a uvidíme, kolik jich zůstane, pak přidáme dvě zpět, abychom zjistili, co se rovná.<br/><br/>Kromě černých a bílých křídel jsme také přidali bezbarvého krocana pro případ, že byste chtěli, aby si malí vybarvili vlastní set. Namísto souboru složky hry můžete proměnit to do řemesla, barvení kusů, vystřihnutí a lepení je dohromady.<br/><br/>Další možností je použít kousky, aby se plstěný deskový příběh.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Užívání alkoholu osobami mladšími 21 let bylo identifikováno jako hlavní problém veřejného zdraví. Studie poznamenávají, že zvyšuje riziko pro zdravotní postižení a může být škodlivé pro vyvíjející se mozek. Nezletilí, kteří pijí, s větší pravděpodobností spáchají sebevraždu, poruší zákon nebo se stanou oběťmi násilí. Alkohol je zapleten do téměř jedné třetiny úmrtí mladistvých. Celkové roční náklady na pití nezletilých se odhadují na 62 miliard dolarů. Zatímco většina zákonů, jejichž cílem je zabránit pití alkoholu nezletilých, je schválena na státní úrovni, existuje legislativní činnost a zájem na federální úrovni na podporu úsilí států o omezení tohoto problému. Tato zpráva popisuje rozsah užívání alkoholu nezletilými, nedávná legislativní činnost v této oblasti a různé politické důsledky. Bude aktualizována, jakmile budou k dispozici nové údaje. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Nebyly to politické lobbování nebo veřejné petice, které vyústily v potravinovou reformu, ale spíše místní úsilí vedené občany s mocí skutečně implementovat a následovat se změnami.<br/><br/>Ukončil jsem příspěvek s odkazem na jednu otázku: Proč je pro nás tak těžké to udělat sami, jako jednotlivci? Pokud celá země může realizovat a šířit společný pohled na jídlo, proč bychom nemohli?<br/><br/>Problém je, že jsme zaplaveni tolika zprávami o tom, co bychom měli jíst a jak bychom měli žít, je těžké vědět, kde začít. Takže spíše než po úspěšných rámcích, které se ukázaly jako funkční (jako je Nordic Food Manifesto), většina lidí skočí z dietního šílenství do dietního šílenství a snaží se najít "správný způsob, jak jíst."<br/><br/>Ale jak se Claus Meyer podařilo?
