Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Poštovní navigace<br/><br/>Life Without Papers získal cenu za nejlepší scénář<br/><br/>Blogový projekt "Life Without Papers", vytvořený Lenem Grantem, představuje příběhy rodin migrantů bez dokladů a mladých lidí. Nedokumentovaní migranti nemají nic. Nemají dovoleno pracovat. Nemají právo na státní dávky ani na místo k životu. Jsou dnes neviditelnou a potenciálně nejzranitelnější skupinou ve Velké Británii.<br/><br/>Mezi nelegální migranty patří ti, kteří jsou obchodováni s lidmi za účelem sexuálního obchodu nebo domácího nevolnictví; zahrnují osoby překračující délku pobytu; ti, jejichž žádost o azyl byla zamítnuta a další, kteří byli v imigračním systému vystaveni selhání. To vše mohlo původně přijít do Spojeného království legálně.<br/><br/>"Nelegální přistěhovalci" - ti, kteří si představovali, že vstoupili do země v zádech nákladních automobilů - tvoří malou část nezdokumentovaných.<br/><br/>Některé zdroje skutečně naznačují, že polovina z odhadovaných 120 000 dětí bez dokladů ve Velké Británii se zde skutečně narodila rodičům bez dokladů.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Lekce šabatu<br/><br/>V Galatským se Pavel zabývá otázkami, jako je svoboda, úloha zákona ve spasení, náš stav v Kristu a povaha života vedeného Duchem, stejně jako prastarou otázkou: Jak mohou být hříšní lidé spravedliví před svatým a spravedlivým Bohem?<br/><br/>Mnozí učenci se domnívají, že Galatským může být nejstarší z Pavlových dopisů. To bylo napsáno v A.D. 49, krátce po slavném Jeruzalémském koncilu (Skutky 15). Proto, kniha může být nejstarší křesťanský dokument známý. Jak objasňují Skutkové a Galaťané, raná církev se ocitla v urputném boji o podstatu spásy, zvláště v případě pohanů. Podle skupiny židovských věřících, známých jako judaisté, víra v Ježíše sama o sobě nebyla pro pohany dost dobrá. pohané musí být také obřezáni a dodržovat Mojžíšovy zákony (Skutky 15:1).<br/><br/>Průvodce biblickým studiem této čtvrti nás vybízí, abychom cestovali s apoštolem Pavlem, když prosí Galatské, aby zůstali věrní Ježíši. Dává nám také možnost zamyslet se nad naším vlastním chápáním pravd, které otevřely cestu pro konečný rozchod Martina Luthera s Římem a obnovení biblického evangelia. |

Frederick byl považován za populární a inteligentní, během své vlády, spolu se svou krásnou manželkou Charlottou, kulturní život v malém městě dosáhl svého zenitu. Tolik básníků a umělců tam strávilo svůj čas, že Hildburghausen byl přezdíván Klein-Weimar, když poslední vévoda Sasko-Gothsko-Altenburský zemřel bez vydání v roce 1825, ostatní větve domu rozhodly o přestavbě Ernestinských vévodství. Dne 12. listopadu 1826 se Fridrich stal vévodou Sasko-Altenburským, kterému dal první Základní zákon v roce 1831, výměnou za média související s Fridrichem, vévodou Sasko-Altenburským ve Wikimedia Commons geneall. net<br/><br/>Fridrich Sasko-Altenburský<br/>–<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15.<br/>Vévodkyně Charlotte Georgine z Meklenburska-Strelitz<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine se narodila v Hannoveru, Brunšvicko-Läneburském kurfiřtství. Byla nejstarším dítětem a dcerou Karla II., velkovévody meklenburského, Šarloty a jejích sester, královny Luisy Pruské, královny Frederiky Hannoverské a princezny Terezie z Thurn und Taxis, byly považovány za nejkrásnější ženy své doby. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter věnoval svůj román Titan čtyřem krásným, Charlotte vyrůstala v Hannoveru, kde její otec působil jako guvernér, jménem svého švagra, krále Jiřího III., který žil v Londýně. Když Charlotte bylo dvanáct let, její matka zemřela a ona byla vychována její matky sestra, Charlotte, který se oženil s otcem v roce 1784 a její sestry byly přineseny její babička, Maria Louise Albertine Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg v Darmstadtu. Dne 3. září 1785, ve věku patnácti let, se Šarlota provdala za vévodu Fridricha Sasko-Altenburského, manželství nebylo šťastné, Šarlota byla mentálně nadřazená Fridrichovi, který ji začal ignorovat. Měli také problémy, Sasko-Hildburghausen byl finančně zničen katastrofální politikou Frederickových předchůdců. Přijímači povolili vévodovi a vévodkyni pouze snížený občanský seznam, otec Charlotte a dva bratři často pobývali s Charlottou v Hildburghausenu. V roce 1787 se přestěhovala do Hildburghausenu natrvalo a stala se předsedkyní úvěrového výboru. V roce 1792 charlottina babička a její sestry uprchly před postupující francouzskou armádou z Darmstadtu do Hildburghausenu a její babička si všimla manžela Charlotty. Ze všech svých povinností plní své manželské povinnosti s horlivostí. Charlotte, která tohoto muže nikdy nemilovala, je vždy těhotná, rodina strávila několik bezstarostných týdnů v Hildburghausenu. V roce 1793 se Charlottena babička vrátila z exilu a cestovala se sestrami Charlotte do Frankfurtu nad Mohanem, Charlotte měla velmi intimní a láskyplný vztah se svou sestrou Friederike a příbuznými ve Strelitzu. V letech 1803 a 1805 navštívil pruský královský pár Hildburghausen, při této příležitosti povolili přijímači vévodskému páru obnovit část svého nábytku. Louise pomáhala vypracovat vyhlášení války, Christian Truchse von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg byl přítelem vévodského páru a kmotr Charlottina syna Edwarda. Mnoho diváků se přišlo podívat na bavorskou korunní princeznu, když přijímala jeho hosty, Truchsei se pokusila dovést nižší Charlottu nejprve do svého hradu, ale ona odmítla, s odkazem na svou dceru. Truchseň odpověděla, Vaše Výsost mi odpustí, ale dokud tu tento hrad stál, Theresa pak popadla barony druhou rukou a ti tři společně procházeli bránou. Vévodkyně dala asi polovinu svého příjmu chudým, důchodcům<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Karel Hesensko-Kasselský<br/>–<br/>Princ Karel Hesensko-Kasselský byl kadetským členem rodu Hesensko-Kasselských a dánským generálem polním maršálem. Vychován s příbuznými u dánského dvora, strávil většinu svého života v Dánsku a jeho matka byla dcerou krále Jiřího II. Velké Británie a Karolíny z Ansbachu a sestrou dánské královny Louisy. Jeho otec, budoucí landgrave, opustil rodinu v roce 1747, v roce 1755 formálně ukončil manželství s Marií. Dědeček, Vilém VIII., lankrabě hesenský, udělil hrabství Hanau a jeho příjmy Marii, mladý princ Karel a jeho dva bratři, Vilém a Fridrich, byli od roku 1747 vychováváni svou matkou a živeni protestantskými příbuznými. V roce 1756 se Marie přestěhovala do Dánska, aby se starala o nezletilé děti své sestry, dánské královny Louise. S ní vzala své syny, kteří byli vychováváni u dvora v paláci Christiansborg v Kodani. Hessská knížata později zůstala v Dánsku a stala se jeho významnými pány, pouze nejstarší bratr William se vrátil do Hesenska v roce 1785 po vzestupu landgraviate. Charles začal kariéru v Dánsku. V roce 1758 byl jmenován plukovníkem, ve věku 20 let generálmajorem, také v roce 1766 byl jmenován generálním guvernérem Norska, tuto pozici zastával až do roku 1768, ale která zůstala většinou titulární, protože během tohoto období nikdy neodešel do Norska. V roce 1763 se jeho starší bratr Vilém oženil s jejich bratrancem, Karel následoval 30. srpna 1766 v paláci Christiansborg - jeho manželkou byla Louise Dánská a Karel se tak stal švagrem svého bratrance, krále Christiana VII. K sňatku došlo navzdory radám daných proti němu, kvůli obviněním z prostopášnosti ze strany prince Charlese. Krátce poté, Charles upadl v nemilost u dvora, a na počátku roku 1767 on a oni by se jejich první dítě, Marie Sophie, tam v roce 1767 a pak jejich druhé dítě, William, v roce 1769. V roce 1768 koupil Karel od rodiny Edelsheimů majetek a vesnici Offenbach-Rumpenheim. V roce 1771 nechal panství rozšířit na zámek a knížecí sídlo a jeho matka Marie v paláci žila až do své smrti v roce 1772. V roce 1781 Karel prodal Rumpenheimský palác svému mladšímu bratrovi, Karel se usadil na hradě Gottorp ve Šlesvicku se svou rodinou. Tam měli své třetí dítě Fridricha v roce 1771, v roce 1770, král Christian VII. dal své sestře panství Tegelhof v Goethe mezi městem Schleswig a Eckernfärde. Od roku 1772 do roku 1776, Charles měl letní sídlo postavené na místě, které pojmenoval Louisenlund na počest své ženy, v září 1772, Charles byl jmenován vrchním velitelem norské armády a on a Louise se přestěhoval do Christiana.

Je považován za zakladatele Casa dEste, protože byl hlavou první rodiny, která se stala pánem Este, Alberto Azzo II byl jediným synem Alberta Azzo I., markraběte milánského. Zdědil otcovy kanceláře kolem roku 1020 a neustále zvyšoval své majetky v severní Itálii, v letech 1069-1070 se snažil získat Maine pro svého syna Hugha, protože jeho manželka, Garsende, byla spoludědičkou předchozích hraběcích rodů Maine. Hugh byl prohlášen za hraběte, ale nemohl zvítězit nad Robertem, vévodou z Normandie, v investituře Kontroverze mezi Jindřichem IV., císařem Svaté říše římské a papežem Řehořem VII., Azzo se pokusil zprostředkovat, ale později se přidal na stranu papeže. Kolem roku 1073 zřídil zámek v Este svou rezidenci, ze které rod Este, ještě před svým stavebním projektem, Este nebyl nic víc než vesnice. Jeho syn Welf se přestěhoval nejprve do Korutan a poté do Bavorska, čímž vznikl jeden z nejvýznamnějších rodů v evropských dějinách, další syn, Fulk I. z Milána, provedl první doložené použití titulu markýz dEste. Azzo II. se oženil s Kunigunde, dcerou Welfa II., hraběte z Altdorfu a měli spolu jedno známé dítě, Welfa vévodu bavorského v letech 1070 až 1077 a od roku 1096 až do své smrti, který byl prvním členem Welfské větve rodu Este. Jeho druhé manželství bylo s Garsende, dcerou Herberta I., hraběte z Maine a měli následující známé syny, Fulco I., markrabě milánský, předek italské větve rodu Este Hugh V., hrabě z Maine, neměl žádný problém. Některé zdroje uvádějí, že se také oženil s Vitalií Orseolo, dcerou Petra Orseola a měl mimomanželský poměr s Matyldou, sestrou Viléma, padovského biskupa, se kterou měl dceru Adelasii, která se provdala za Guglielma Adelardiho.

Byl prvním členem welfské větve rodu Este, v rodokmenu staršího rodu Welf je počítán jako Welf IV. Welf byl synem Azza II. z Este a jeho manželky Kunigunde z Altdorfu, když Welfsův strýc z matčiny strany, Welf, vévoda korutanský, zemřel bezdětný, Welf zdědil jeho majetek. Welf se oženil s Ethelindou ze Northeimu, dcerou bavorského vévody Otty II., když se jeho tchán, vévoda Otto, stal nepřítelem krále Jindřicha IV. a propadl jeho vévodství, Welf zůstal králi věrný. V souladu s Jindřichovými příkazy zapudil a rozvedl svou vévodkyni Ethelindu a tato událost se odehrála v Goslaru v roce 1070, kdy se stavové Bavorska tiše podrobili nově vzniklému vévodovi, který byl představitelem jednoho z nejstarších rodů v provincii. Jeho odmítnutí vévodkyně, které mohlo být považováno za akt nespravedlnosti. Papež a císař byli povrchně smířeni v roce 1076, ale rok je opět viděl v aktivním nepřátelství. Jindřich v důsledku opakovaných aktů vzpoury prohlásil Welfa za sesazeného ve svém nově nabytém vévodství. S podporou svých věrných Bavorů a s pomocí svého otce v Itálii si však Welf dokázal udržet své místo, Řehoř však roku 1085 zemřel a jeho nástupci se méně intenzivně podíleli na záležitostech Německa. Welf se po rozvodu v roce 1070 oženil se svou první manželkou Juditou Flanderskou, dcerou Balduina IV., hraběte z Flander, a vdovou po Tostigu Godwinsonovi, hraběti z Northumbrie. V roce 1089 se Welfův syn Welf oženil s Matyldou Toskánskou, čímž posílil vztahy s papežem, nicméně poté, co se mladší Welf rozvedl s Matyldou v roce 1095, se Welf s králem Jindřichem IV. vyrovnal a byl znovu potvrzen na jeho pozici bavorského vévody. Po smrti svého otce Azza v roce 1097 se Welf pokusil získat majetek svých otců jižně od Alp, v roce 1099 se Welf připojil k tomu, co se stalo známým jako křížová výprava z roku 1101, spolu s Vilémem IX Akvitánským, Hugem z Vermandois a Idou Rakouskou. Jeho hlavním úspěchem bylo zabránit střetu mezi ostatními křižáky, kteří drancovali byzantské území na cestě do Konstantinopole, sám Welf unikl fiasku, ale zemřel na cestě zpět do Paphosu na Kypru v roce 1101 a byl pohřben ve Weingartenském opatství.

Bavorský<br/>–<br/>Jindřich IX., zvaný Černý, byl od roku 1120 do roku 1126 bavorským vévodou. Jindřich byl synem bavorského vévody Welfa I. z manželství s Juditou. Jako mladík spravoval rodové majetky Este jižně od Alp, sňatkem s Wulfhildou, dcerou vévody Magnuse Saského, získal kolem roku 1095 část panství Billungů v okolí Läneburgu. Usiloval o nástupnictví po svém tchánovi jako saský vévoda, když Magnus v roce 1106 zemřel bez dědiců. Vévoda Jindřich nicméně udržoval úzké vztahy s vládnoucí salskou dynastií, v roce 1116 se připojil k císaři Jindřichovi V. Po svém starším bratru Welfovi II. jako bavorský vévoda, když zemřel bezdětný v roce 1120, byl Jindřich také nápomocný při realizaci Wormského konkordátu z roku 1122, čímž ukončil dlouhotrvající spor o investituru mezi papežem a císařem. Manželství bylo uzavřeno v květnu 1127, odcizení mezi dynastiemi Welfů a Hohenstaufenů trvalo až do 13. století. Poté, co Lothar vyhrál volby, uvalil na Fridricha II. imperiální zákaz.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Sledujte nás na Facebooku<br/><br/>JSTE AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Toužíte po cukru? Zde je to, co se vám vaše tělo snaží říct<br/><br/>podle<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Přibývání na váze z nekontrolovatelné chutě stranou, to může být frustrující mít neustálou touhu po něčem nezdravém a neví proč. Dobrou zprávou je, že obvykle existuje důvod, který je základem této hořící touhy po sáčku bramborových lupínků, nebo pocit, že byste mohli skutečně zemřít, pokud nedostanete okurku hned (i když nejste těhotná). Pokud máte například představy o tyčinkách Mléčné dráhy, mohlo by to znamenat, že ve vaší stravě chybí velmi specifická živina. (Yup - je to složitější, než se říká, že čokoládová tyčinka je tak zatraceně chutná.)<br/><br/>Mluvili jsme s Los Angeles-založené dietolog Shira Lenchewski, MS, RD, dostat hubený na některé běžné chutě, stejně jako to, co můžete udělat, aby nasytit hlad, aniž by se přes palubu. Pokračujte v rolování pro některé vážně dobré informace!<br/><br/>Pokud toužíte po čokoládě<br/><br/>To znamená: Mohlo by vám chybět hořčík ve vaší stravě, říká Lenchewski. "Magnezium je nezbytný minerál, který se podílí na výrobě energie, metabolismu glukózy a funkci svalů. To platí zejména pro ty, kteří tvrdě dostávají do posilovny," vysvětluje. Navíc hladina hořčíku během předmenstruačních týdnů menstruace klesá, což vysvětluje, proč PMS tak často přichází s choutky po čokoládě.<br/><br/>Místo toho sáhnete po vysoce kvalitní hořké čokoládě s nízkým obsahem cukru, která má přirozeně vysoký obsah hořčíku. "Doporučuji držet se 75 procent kakaa nebo vyšší a spárovat ji s jiným zdrojem bohatým na hořčík, jako jsou slunečnicová semínka," říká Lenchewski. Navrhuje čokoládovou značku Hu, malou dávkovací potravinářskou společnost, která se zaměřuje na vysoce kvalitní suroviny vyráběné lokálně. "Je to trochu drahé, ale o důvod víc, proč držet porce pod kontrolou," říká. "Je to můj osobní favorit." Jsme také velcí fanoušci superfood-balené Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Pokud toužíte po bonbónech<br/><br/>To znamená: "Lravování čistého cukru je dobrým znamením, že vám dochází energie," říká Lenchewski. "Přemýšlejte o tom. Co je jedna věc, kterou svíjíte po hrozném nočním spánku nebo kolem čtvrté hodiny odpoledne během stresujícího pracovního dne? Odpověď je obvykle cukr, protože se používá jako instantní palivo pro buňky našeho těla.<br/><br/>Místo toho sáhnete po jablkech s ořechovým máslem. "Pokud jste přepadení svých spolupracovníků, doporučuji pomalejší spalování sacharidů se zdrojem tuku nebo bílkovin, "říká Lenchewski. Na rozdíl od jednoduchého cukru to bude palivo pro vaše buňky a zároveň se vyhnete havárii po cukru. Dvě možnosti, které dělají pro skvělé pick-me-up příště budete chtít bonbóny: nakrájené jablko s výběrem ořechového másla, nebo bobule s 2% neslazeného řeckého jogurtu. Také rádi třepeme sladký zub těmito návykovými kokosovými lupínky - plní se, bez přidaného cukru a prostě tak dobře.<br/><br/>Pokud máte chuť na sůl<br/><br/>Znamená to: "Pokud nic jiného než nejsolnější okurka neuděláte, možná nebudete pít dostatek H2O," říká Lenchewski. "Sůl pomáhá tělu držet se vody, takže po ní toužíme, když potřebujeme tekutiny."<br/><br/>Místo toho sáhnete po vodě. "Zůstaňte hydratovaní, zejména když se blížíme letním měsícům," říká. Až příště zasáhne touha, zkuste ji (doslova) uhasit několika osvěžujícími sklenicemi a možná zjistíte, že naléhavost sodíku zmizí. "Pokud vás nudí obyčejná voda, zkuste přidat mátu, citron nebo mražené ovoce, abyste ho smíchali," říká Lenchewski. A pokud to stále nefunguje, existuje zdravější alternativa k pytlovitým hranolkům nebo hranolkům. "Pokud opravdu toužíte po soli, opečené mořské řasy jsou skvělou nízkokalorickou volbou," říká.<br/><br/>Pokud máte chuť na škrobové sacharidy, jako jsou těstoviny<br/><br/>To znamená: "Vzhledem k tomu, že potraviny s vysokým obsahem sacharidů zvyšují hormon serotoninu, chuť na škrob může být znamením, že potřebujete posilovač nálady, " říká Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Místo toho sáhnete po koupeli! "Vyhoďte Epsomské soli, protože je čas na nějaké vážné R + R," říká Lenchewski. "Věřte mi. Dopřát si škrob zdarma - pro všechny se v tuto chvíli cítí opravdu dobře, ale druhý den vás pravděpodobně bude více vyrušovat." (Jako každý, kdo někdy přehnal chuť na pizzu nebo těstoviny, to ví.) Takže až se příště budete chtít ponořit do mísy sacharidů, nakreslit koupel, zapálit svíčku a dopřát si bez lítosti nebo hustých kalorií.<br/><br/>Pokud máte chuť na zmrzlinu<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Znamená to: "Vaše tělo vám může říkat, že potřebuje nějaký zdravý tuk."<br/><br/>Místo toho sáhnete po kokosové zmrzlině. "Jsem realista, takže pokud toužíte po zmrzlině, nebudu doporučit hrst vlašských ořechů, které jsou samozřejmě plné zdravého tuku," říká Lenchewski. "V případě nouze o zmrzlinu doporučuji kokosové zmrzliny s nízkým obsahem cukru, jako je Coconut Bliss nebo Kippyho třísložková zmrzlina v Los Angeles." Můžeme zaručit, že kokosová zmrzlina chutná neuvěřitelně a stejně jako skutečná věc.<br/><br/>Pokud máte chuť na burger<br/><br/>To znamená: Potřebujete železo. "Pokud nemůžete přestat myslet na červené maso, je tu šance, že vaše tělo touží po železu, b12 a kyselině listové," říká Lenchewski. "To platí zejména během nebo přibližně v tomto období měsíce."<br/><br/>Místo toho sáhněte po zdravějším burgeru. "Jednou týdně jsem zastáncem travnatého, antibiotického a bezhormonálního červeného masa," říká Lenchewski. "Zkuste experimentovat s otevřeným bizonským burgerem - který, řezaný na řez, je štíhlejší a má více železa než hovězí maso." Nejezte maso? Snažte se začlenit nějaký doplněk železa na rostlinné bázi do vaší rutiny, jako je spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Webové služby, prodejci a kybernetické zákony!<br/><br/>aktualizováno:duben 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Počítačové zpracování tohoto světa změnilo lidskou výkonnost do značné míry a to i mimo měření. Například nyní můžete posílat důležité informace po celém světě jediným kliknutím myši, a to díky připojení k internetu. Je smutné, že je to široká konektivita a popularita mezi lidmi, internet také zvýšil šance na počítačové zločiny. Internetové zločiny nebo počítačové zločiny jsou široce známé jako "kybernetické zločiny".<br/><br/>"Kybernetické zákony" je něco nového v soudním systému, ale získal hodně pozornosti v poslední době. Termín kybernetická kriminalita je něco velmi synonymem pro konvenční trestné činnosti, jediný rozdíl je prostředek popravy. Existují převážně dva typy kybernetických zločinů, první z nich je, že počítače jsou hlavními cíli a zahrnují případy poškození dat, škodlivý kód a dokonce i přístup k trestným datům. Druhým je, ve kterém je počítač pouze nástrojem, pomocí kterého jsou páchány konvenční trestné činy např. pro kybernetický terorismus, spamming, kybernetické stalking a mnoho dalších.<br/><br/>To je místo, kde webové stránky konzultant nebo prodejce přichází na scénu. I když není vědom všech kybernetických zákonů přítomných k dnešnímu dni, webové stránky prodejce vám poradí na některé z nejdůležitějších kybernetických zákonů při vytváření vašeho webu.<br/><br/>To může zahrnovat obecnou znalost autorských práv nebo dokonce ochranu obsahu vašich vlastních webových stránek. Vysvětlení všech práv, která vlastníte jako vlastník webových stránek, je také jedním z úkolů, které může dodavatel webových stránek dělat při vývoji vašich webových stránek. Dodavatel vám může také pomoci tím, že vám nabídne informace o různých kybernetických zákonech na ochranu dat. Kromě toho vám může dodavatel také nabídnout informace o jakémkoliv novém kybernetickém zákoně, o kterém nemusíte vědět, dokud se nedozvíte. Kybernetické zákony se mohou v jednotlivých zemích lišit, jedním z posledních příkladů může být zákon o souborech cookie vydaný ve Spojeném království, který zabraňuje tomu, aby webové stránky ukládaly data o prohlížení. Podle zákona o souborech cookie nemohou webové stránky ve Spojeném království ukládat soubory cookie bez informačního souhlasu surfaře.<br/><br/>Právě po zavedení takového zákona mají webové stránky nyní vyskakovací okno, které žádá o souhlas návštěvníka s ukládáním souborů cookies. Tyto soubory jsou používány webovými stránkami k analýze chování návštěvníků na základě toho, které reklamy jsou pak zveřejněny v uživatelském okně. S hacking už není nová věc pro nás všechny, myslíte si, že taková pravidla a předpisy mohou zabránit on-line padělání nebo počítačové trestné činnosti? Technologie se vyvinula rychlým tempem, ale stále lidé neupřednostňují nakupování online kvůli obavám z osobních nebo bankovních údajů, které se dostaly do hackerů. S nárůstem počítačové kriminality se také zvýšila potřeba přísných kybernetických zákonů, aby se omezila stejná a podpořila bezriziková nákupní zkušenost.<br/><br/>Třídy kyberzločinů<br/><br/>V průběhu let došlo ke třem hlavním třídám kybernetických zločinů:<br/><br/>Neoprávněný přístup k případům počítačového systému, který zahrnuje hackování nebo krádež uživatelských jmen a hesel pro získání přístupu k osobním údajům příslušného uživatele. Tento druh přístupu zadními vrátky je organizován pomocí Trojského koně. Uvolnění škodlivých programů, jako je Trojan House, červy nebo počítačové viry atd. Poslední třída zahrnuje kybernetické pronásledování uživatele nebo online obtěžování.<br/><br/>Přímé důsledky kybernetické trestné činnosti<br/><br/>Pokles prodejů<br/><br/>Snížení počtu zaměstnanců v důsledku zpoždění sítě<br/><br/>Ztráta personalizovaných informací, jako je výzkumná práce<br/><br/>Narušení komunikačního procesu<br/><br/>Nepřímé důsledky kyberzločinu<br/><br/>Důvěryhodnost v našem finančním systému<br/><br/>Značka image je pošpiněna na trhu<br/><br/>Kybernetická kriminalita ovlivňuje obchodní vztahy na trhu<br/><br/>Pocit důvěry ve státní politiky a vládní agentury je ztracen<br/><br/>Prevence kyberkriminality<br/><br/>Jako netizens existují určitá opatření, která bychom měli zvážit pro bezpečné a bezpečné on-line zkušenosti. Zde jsou některé z nich:<br/><br/>První věc, kterou musíte udělat, je uchovávat osobní údaje pro sebe a vyhnout se sdílení stejného on-line.<br/><br/>Vyhněte se sdílení fotografií s přáteli nebo cizími lidmi.<br/><br/>Instalace nejnovější verze antiviru do vašeho systému vám může nabídnout dobrou linii obrany proti internetovým hrozbám, jako jsou viry a malware.<br/><br/>Udržování zálohy vašich cenných dat je dobrou volbou, jak se vyhnout problémům, jako je kontaminace viry.<br/><br/>Neposílejte informace o kreditní kartě na nezabezpečené weby, které nemají žádný platný certifikát.<br/><br/>Instalace bezpečnostního programu, který vám nabízí kontrolu nad soubory cookie stránek a chrání vás před sledováním webových stránek.<br/><br/>Umístění hostitelských zařízení pro detekci narušení na servery vám pomůže sledovat nesrovnalosti v provozu vašich webových stránek.<br/><br/>Doporučuje se použití firewallu.<br/><br/>Proč jsou kybernetické útoky tak populární?<br/><br/>Levnější než tradiční metody podvádění<br/><br/>Sledování kyberzločinů není snadné<br/><br/>Přesná místa nelze snadno sledovat<br/><br/>Nedostatek fyzické bariéry ve světě internetu<br/><br/>Kybernetická kriminalita postihuje velké množství lidí<br/><br/>Závěr<br/><br/>Skutečnost, že lidská mysl má nevyzpytatelnou moc, je nepopiratelná, což je důvod, proč internetové zločiny rostou obrovskou rychlostí. Dokonce i historie byla svědkem některé z největších internetové bezpečnosti pryč kaput rukou hackerů, kteří se snadno dostali pryč taky. Jediný způsob, jak omezit takový zločin, je zůstat si vědom kybernetických zákonů, které máme dnes, které mohou být buď prostřednictvím internetu nebo prostřednictvím webových stránek / dodavatelů IT. Zákon o informačních technologiích musí být vyvážený tak, aby se ukázal jako příliš přísný pro lidi, kteří se podílejí na kybernetických zločinech, a zároveň by nikdy neměl bránit růstu internetového průmyslu.<br/><br/>Autor Bio: Maneet Puri v současné době vede kvalitní web design firma se sídlem v Novém Dillí, Indie.
