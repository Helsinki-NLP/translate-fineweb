| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Prostřednictvím Bible C2000 SeriesSmíme se obrátit na knihu Skutků, kapitola jedna, jak začneme naše studium rané církve.<br/>Lukáš, autor knihy Skutků, společník Pavla apoštola, který byl také autorem evangelia Podle Lukáše, napsal tato dvě pojednání příteli, Theophilus. Theophilus je řecké jméno. Je to jméno, které má krásný význam. Někteří věří, že to vůbec nebyl člověk, ale že evangelium a kniha Skutků byly adresovány milovníkům Boha, ať jste kdokoli. Existují i jiné tradice, které říkají, že Theophilus byl ve skutečnosti Lukášovým pánem, že v té době byli lékaři otroky, obvykle otroky bohatého patrona. Takže Lukášův pán byl Theofilos a propustil Lukáše, aby byl s Pavlem na misijních cestách. Lukáš tedy píše zpět svému bývalému pánovi. To je raná tradice církve, ale je samozřejmě nemožné to dokázat, stejně jako mnoho jiných tradic.<br/>Jsou také tací, kteří věří, že když byl Pavel v Troadě a měl vidění muže, který ho volal: "Přejdi do Makedonie a pomoz nám," že ten muž v Pavlově vidění nebyl nikdo jiný než Lukáš. První, koho Pavel skutečně potkal, když přišel do Makedonie, byl Lukáš. A jak jsme v knize Skutků, zjistíte, že když se dostaneme k té části knihy Skutků, Lukáš začne psát více v první osobě než ve třetí osobě. Právě v tomto konkrétním bodě Skutků apoštolů se Lukáš stal Pavlovým společníkem a začal s ním cestovat. Začal používat zájmena "my" a "my" místo "oni" a "oni". Není pochyb o tom, že Luke se stal účastníkem a očitým svědkem těch věcí, které se odehrávaly od tohoto okamžiku.<br/>Začne Skutky apoštolů tím, že ji spojí s evangeliem podle Lukáše. Je zajímavé, že úplně poslední věc, kterou Lukáš zaznamenává ve svém evangeliu, je úplně první věc, kterou zaznamenává ve Skutcích apoštolů. Zjišťujeme, že evangelium Lukáše se zavírá, když Ježíš říká svým učedníkům, aby čekali v Jeruzalémě, dokud nebudou obdařeni mocí z výsosti. A pak Ježíš vystoupil do nebe, a tak uzavírá evangelium. Při otevírání Skutků apoštolů píše:<br/>První pojednání [to jest evangelium podle Lukáše] jsem ti napsal, Teofile, o všem, co Ježíš začal dělat a učit (Skutky 1,1).<br/>Klíčové slovo začíná. Evangelium podle Lukáše není úplným příběhem služby Ježíše Krista. Je to jen začátek služby Ježíše Krista. Ježíš nadále slouží potřebám lidí. Ježíš nadále uzdravuje nemocné. Ježíš nadále křísí mrtvé. Ježíš nadále slouží své lásce a svému evangeliu světu, až nyní slouží skrze ty učedníky, kteří byli pomazáni Jeho Duchem svatým. Ale Kristova služba pokračuje; v podstatě je předpoklad, že Lukáš přijímá ve Skutcích apoštolů. První pojednání o všem, co Ježíš začal, jak dělat, tak učit.<br/>Z tohoto důvodu jsou Skutky apoštolů nedokončenou knihou, v níž Pán pokračuje v díle života těch, kteří se zasvětili tomu, aby se stali nástroji Božími. Být vedeni a vedeni a pomazáni Jeho Duchem svatým, pokračovat v Ježíšově službě v dnešním světě. Nyní Bůh nařídil, aby Jeho dílo bylo vykonáno prostřednictvím lidských nástrojů. Neříkám, že musí být vykonáno. Bůh může pro své dílo použít andělské bytosti a během knihy Zjevení přijde čas, kdy Bůh použije anděly, aby hlásali Jeho evangelium lidem po celém světě. Zjevení, kapitola 14, "První anděl letící středem nebe s věčným evangeliem" (Zj 14,6). Ale v současné době se Bůh rozhodl použít lidské nástroje. Tak nedokonalé, jak mohou být, ale to je to, co Bůh nařídil použít. Vzrušující na tom je, že Bůh mě použije a Bůh použije vás. Tolikrát jsme prosili, "Pane, nemohu mluvit. Nikdy jsem nebyl schopen mluvit předtím, nebo dokonce teď, Pane." Jak se Mojžíš snažil prosit Boží volání. Jeremiah řekl: "Pane, jsem jen dítě, nikdo mě nebude poslouchat." A my všichni máme své výmluvy, proč nemůžeme být použiti. Že ano? Všichni známe důvody, proč nás Bůh nemohl použít.<br/>Jednou, když Pán volal proroka, aby konal Jeho dílo, řekl: "Pane, pošli, koho chceš." Pán řekl: "Hej, povolal jsem tě." "Pane, dobrý nápad, pošli, koho chceš." Tak často jsme v této pozici, "Pane, pošlete rukou koho chcete, kdokoli kromě mě Pane." A přesto, Bůh nařídil, aby nás použít.<br/>Každý z nás může ukázat své vlastní nedokonalosti. Každý z nás může poukázat na své vlastní neschopnosti, a každý z nás může najít výmluvu, proč by mě Bůh nechtěl použít. Ale přesto, Bůh se rozhodl použít vás. Aby se skrze tvůj život mohl zjevit světu v nouzi. Divíš se, když má Bůh takové nástroje, aby použil, jak to kdy udělal, že?<br/>Až do dne, kdy byl vzat vzhůru, dal skrze Ducha svatého přikázání apoštolům, které si vyvolil (Skutky 1:2):<br/>To je to, čím ukončil Lukášovo evangelium. V den, kdy byl Ježíš vzat vzhůru, poté, co řekl apoštolům, aby čekali na udělení moci.<br/>Kterýmž i [totiž apoštolům] ukázal se živým po umučení svém skrze mnohé neomylné důkazy (Skutky 1:3).<br/>Je těžké popřít skutečnost vzkříšení Ježíše Krista. Byl jsem pobaven, stejně jako naštvaný a podrážděný, článkem, který jsem četl v registru Santa Ana minulou sobotu. O teorii stvoření a evolučních teoriích, které jsou prezentovány na okresních školách, jeden profesor řekl, že vyučuje vědu, a proto se zabývají pouze fakty, a že nemají místo pro teorie. Protože věda je založena na faktech a stvoření je založeno na náboženských pověrách. Věřit náboženským teoriím vyžaduje hodně víry. Když se zabýváte fakty, můžete je prostě přijmout. Pomyslel jsem si, "Velmi zajímavé na této vědecké třídě, učili mě, že je to fakt, že svět je čtyři miliardy let starý. A není to tak dávno, co jsem chodila do školy."<br/>Je zajímavé, že Bible nikdy nemusela být revidována nebo aktualizována, aby vyhovovala současným údajům, které lidé objevili. A přesto, pokud byste dnes vzali mé středoškolské učebnice vědy a pokusili se z nich vyučovat přírodovědné předměty, zjistili byste, že mnohé z věcí, které se učily jako vědecký fakt, když jsem byl na střední škole, už nejsou uznávány jako vědecký fakt. Protoplazma jednoduché buňky již není jednoduchá buňka, ale nesmírně složitá. Pokud existuje nějaká skutečnost, která může být doložena v historii, je to skutečnost vzkříšení Ježíše Krista z mrtvých.<br/>Máme právní systém, který je založen na svědectví svědků. Pokud je člověk obviněn ze zločinu a jsou lidé, kteří byli svědky tohoto zločinu, zatímco byl páchán, a oni jsou přivedeni ke standardu a přísahají, že řeknou pravdu, celou pravdu a nic než pravdu, tak jim k tomu dopomáhej Bůh. A ve svém výslechu potvrzují, že: "Viděl jsem toho muže v bance dvacátého třetího května. Viděl jsem ho vytáhnout zbraň z kabátu. Slyšel jsem ho požadovat, aby mu byly dány všechny peníze. Viděl jsem ho, když opustil banku. Viděl jsem ho, jak ho strážník venku zadržel.“ A pokud se vám podaří získat tři nebo čtyři svědky, kteří na toho muže ukáží, a jejich svědectví bude podrobeno křížovému výslechu, ten člověk je souzen za vinu. Máme dva nebo tři svědky, kteří dosvědčují stejnou historku o tom muži, a je přijímáno jako fakt, že on je ten, kdo spáchal zločin a je vinen.<br/>Po Ježíšově smrti, když vstal z mrtvých, se zjevil mnoha různým lidem, kteří přísahali, že ho viděli, že s ním mluvili, že se jim zjevil na různých místech za různých okolností. A po dobu čtyřiceti dnů byl na návštěvě s nimi. A najednou, až pět set lidí, kteří byli shromážděni na jednom místě, On se objevil. Je těžké jen odložit stranou nebo popřít svědectví těchto lidí. To znamená zdiskreditovat celý náš právní systém. Ale nejen to, tito muži, kteří dosvědčovali, že viděli vzkříšeného Pána, že s ním mluvili, že s ním jedli, všichni, s výjimkou jednoho, se setkali s násilnou smrtí z rukou jiných lidí, protože tvrdili, že příběh, který vyprávěli, byl pravdivý. Mluvíte o svědcích, kteří přísahali, že řeknou pravdu, celou pravdu, nic než pravdu. "Ukázal se živý po své vášni mnoha neomylnými důkazy."<br/>A když byli viděni po čtyřicet dní, mluvili k nim o tom, co se týká království Božího (Skutky 1:3):<br/>Někdy jsme vinit učedníky, protože jejich otázky o načasování Božího království. Ať je třeba mít na paměti, že Boží království bylo oblíbeným předmětem Ježíše Krista. Vždycky mluvil o Božím království a je to velká naděje, že On zasadil do srdcí všech lidí. Svět nepůjde navždy pod mocí temnoty, pod porobou zla. Bůh jednoho dne nastolí své království na zemi. Království spravedlivé radosti a pokoje. "Ježíš kralovati bude, kdež před sluncem běží cesty jeho, a království jeho bude se rozprostírati od břehu až k břehu." A ten den bude tím nejslavnějším dnem, jaký kdy svět viděl, protože v Jeho království budou odstraněny nemoci, utrpení a bolest. Jako hřích a chamtivost a tyto věci, které učinily svět tak nesnesitelným místem, budou zrušeny v Jeho království. Není divu, že bezbožný komercionalismus, vykořisťování člověka, všechny tyto věci byly zrušeny v Jeho slavném království, když vládne. Učedníci byli dychtiví, aby se na to dostali. Jsem dychtivý, abych se na to dostal; Jsem dychtivý po tom, aby Jeho království přišlo. A Ježíš nám řekl, když se modlíme, první prosbou je: "Přijď království tvé. Buď vůle tvá jako v nebi, tak i na zemi" (Mt 6,10). To je ten správný druh touhy, kterou bychom měli mít všichni. Toužím po království Božím. A tak k nim během tohoto čtyřicetidenního období mluvil o království.<br/>A když se s nimi shromáždil, přikázal jim, aby neodcházeli z Jeruzaléma, ale aby očekávali Otcovo zaslíbení, o němž jste, praví, slyšeli ode mne.<br/>Řekl: "Hleďte, zůstaňte v Jeruzalémě, dokud nedosáhnete Otcova zaslíbení." Toto zaslíbení, o kterém mluví, je bezpochyby zaslíbení v Joelovi, kde Pán slíbil: "A stane se v pozdějších dnech, praví Pán, že vyleji svého Ducha na každé tělo; a vaši synové a dcery budou prorokovat a vaši mladíci budou snít, vaši starci uvidí vidění; a na mé služebníky a mé služebnice vyleji svého Ducha, praví Hospodin." Přislíbení Otce: přijde den, kdy Bůh vylije svého Ducha na každé tělo, na všechny věřící, a každý z nich obdrží tuto dynamiku od Boha.<br/>Jan totiž řekl, že bude skutečně pokřtěn vodou, ale vy budete pokřtěni Duchem svatým za nemnoho dní (Skutky 1:5).<br/>Myšlenka křtu byla myšlenka emersion, křtitele. Jan pokřtil vodou, ponořil lidi do vody, "budete ponořeni v Duchu svatém za ne mnoho dní."<br/>Když se tedy sešli, ptali se ho: "Pane, obnovíš v tomto čase království Izraele?"<br/>"Kdy to bude, Pane? Kdy je čas na tuto obnovu?" A Ježíš k nim nyní mluví, ne o království, ale o moci, kterou dostanou za službu. A tak odkládá jejich otázku.<br/>Říkajíce jim: Není vám dovoleno znáti časů a časů, kteréž Otec dal v moc svou.<br/>"Není na vás, abyste to věděli." Žili neustále v očekávání okamžitého založení království. Během celého Ježíšova života očekávali, že Ho kdykoli vstoupí do telefonní budky a vyjde jako zachránce světa. Shazzam! Ukázat svou moc a svrhnout vlády světa, založení Božího království na zemi. A oni čekali každý den na tuto změnu se projeví. A kdykoli Ježíš mluvil o tom, že půjde do Jeruzaléma, že bude předán do rukou hříšného člověka, a pak bude ukřižován, "Ach, ne, Pane, ne, ty nerozumíš království, Pane, buď tak daleko od Tebe." Když Ježíš zemřel na kříži, všichni byli velmi zklamáni.<br/>Dva učedníci na cestě do Emauz, tak smutní. "Hej, hoši. Jak to, že jste tak smutní jako vaše chůze?" "Co tím myslíte? Musíte být cizinec tady, pokud nevíte, co se v poslední době děje v Jeruzalémě." "Jaké věci?" "Ach, muž jménem Ježíše Nazaretského ... ó člověče, bylo to mocné a mocné. Boží pomazání bylo na jeho životě. Doufali jsme, že v něm je vysvobození Izraele, ale ukřižovali ho. Doufali jsme . . . nyní je mrtvý." Nyní vstal a říká: "Za několik dní, přátelé, obdržíte Otcovo zaslíbení." "Ach, jaký slib? Slib o založení království?" Vidíte, bylo legitimní, aby se zeptali. "Je to Pán? Dobře! Je to čas? Chystáte se nyní založit své království? "Ne. Není to pro vás znát ty časy, které Otec určil nebo že Otec má ve své vlastní moci. Ale přijmete moc, až na vás sestoupí Duch svatý. "<br/>Řecká předložka epi se používá k označení nového vztahu, který měli mít s Duchem svatým. V evangeliu podle Jana, kapitola 14, když tam Ježíš slibuje, že pošle Ducha svatého, řekl: "Nenechám vás bez útěchy. Já přijdu k vám a budu se modlit k Otci a on vám pošle jiného utěšitele, Ducha pravdy, kterého svět nemůže přijmout, protože ho nevidí, ani nezná, ale vy ho znáte, neboť s vámi přebývá a bude ve vás“ (Jan 14:17-18). Stejná řecká předložka jako ta naše, ale oni to hláskují "en" místo "v". Dvojí vztah tam v Janovi: On je s vámi, ale On bude přebývat ve vás. Ale teď Ježíš řekl, že přijmete moc, až na vás přijde Duch Svatý. Řecká předložka epi, která je v různých textech v celém Novém zákoně přeložena jako "na" nebo "přes", nebo se mi to líbí, "přetečení".<br/>V sedmé kapitole Janova evangelia čteme: "V poslední den, ve velký den svátku, kdy tam Ježíš stál na Chrámové hoře a volal k lidu: 'Jestliže někdo žízní, ať přijde ke mně a pije; a kdo pije z vody, kterou dávám, z jeho nitra vytrysknou proudy živé vody.'" Jan řekl: "To řekl o Duchu, který ještě nebyl dán, aby ho přijali ti, kteří v něj věří." (Jan 7:37-39). Co řekl o Duchu? Že to bude jako proud živé vody, která vytéká. Líbí se mi, "Když vás Duch přetéká," na vás, nebo nad vámi, nebo přetéká od vás. Takže trojí vztah: On je s vámi před vaším obrácením, On je ten, kdo vám dává poznat, že jste hříšník, On je ten, kdo poukazuje na Ježíše Krista jako na odpověď, když přesvědčuje svět o hříchu, spravedlnosti a soudu. Ve chvíli, kdy otevřeš svůj život a srdce Ježíši Kristu a pozveš Ho, aby přišel, přijde Duch Svatý a začne tě přebývat. "Nevíte, že nejste sami sebou, že jste byli koupeni za cenu, proto oslavujte Boha svým tělem a svým duchem, který je Jeho. A nevíte, že vaše tělo je chrámem Ducha Svatého, který je ve vás? Neopíjejte se vínem, v němž je přebytek, ale nasyťte se, nebo buďte naplněni Duchem.“ (1Kor 6,19-20; Ef 5,18) Ale nyní je tu třetí vztah. To je posilující zkušenost.<br/>Obdržíte [dunamus] dynamika, když Duch svatý přišel [epi] na vás [nebo nad vámi, nebo když je to přetečení od vás], a budete mi svědky (Skutky 1: 8)<br/>A tak dynamika, být svědkem pro Ježíše Krista. Je zajímavé, že slovo svědek v řečtině je slovo martus, odkud dostaneme naše slovo mučedník. A v řečtině to znamená mučedník. Svědek je ten, kdo nejen hlásá to, čemu věří, žije to, čemu věří, je to, čemu věří, a věří tomu tak silně, že pokud to bude nutné, zemře za to, čemu věří. Tak silná je jeho víra. Je to martus. Nebojí se zemřít za to, čemu věří.<br/>Vzpomínáte si, když se Pavel vracel do Jeruzaléma a Agabus sestoupil z Cesareje, vzal Pavlův opasek, svázal se a řekl: "Tak bude spoután muž, kterému patří tento opasek, až se dostane do Jeruzaléma." A Paulovi přátelé začali plakat a říkali: "Ach, Paule, nechoď, nechoď." A on řekl: "Co myslíš těmi slzami? Myslíš, že mě odradíš? Myslíš, že se bojím, že budu svázán? Jsem připraven zemřít." Byl to martus. "Jsem připraven zemřít." Být usmrcen pro svou víru z tebe neudělal mučedníka; protože jsi byl mučedníkem, byl jsi usmrcen. Protože jsi byl svědkem, protože jsi tomu věřil tak silně. Takže to z tebe neudělalo svědka, jen to dokázalo, co jsi byl. Byl jsi svědkem po celou dobu. Kdybys nebyl martus, nikdy bys nešel na smrt. Odvolal bys to, řekl bys: "Whoa, whoa, počkej, počkej. Vydržte, změníme kurz. Myslím, že jsem možná udělal chybu." Pak řeknete: "No, nebyl to martus. Krádež koně z vás nedělá zloděje koní; jen to dokazuje, že jste byl. Nikdo neukradne koně, pokud není zloděj koní. Takže, krádež z vás nedělá zloděje koní, jen dokazuje, že jste byli celou dobu. Být umučen jen dokazuje, co jste byli svědky, martus. "A budete svědky." A není zajímavé, že většina z nich byla umučena? "Svědci pro mě."<br/>Svědek měl být jak v Jeruzalémě, tak v celém Judsku (Skutky 1:8).<br/>Svědek začal přímo doma. Nejtěžší místo, že? Je to začít přímo doma v Jeruzalémě, a pak v oblasti kolem Jeruzaléma, v oblasti Judeje. A pak to bylo rozšířit se do Samaří. A pak to bylo jít do nejzazších končin světa. A jak budeme studovat knihu Skutků, uvidíme tento vývoj. Jak začalo svědectví v Jeruzalémě. To se dozvíme v další kapitole. A pak uvidíme, jak se to začalo šířit po Judsku, a pak Phillip vystoupil do Samaří, a nakonec jsou Pavel a Barnabáš povoláni, aby šli do nejzazších končin světa. A tak se svědectví rozšířilo skrze pomazání a zplnomocnění Ducha svatého.<br/>Když to řekl, když to viděli, byl vyzdvižen a oblak jim ho vzal z očí (Skutky 1:9).<br/>Toto je poslední zaslíbení, které dal Ježíš svým učedníkům. To jsou poslední slova před Jeho nanebevstoupením. Samozřejmě, později přišel a mluvil s Pavlem a ostatními, ale před Jeho nanebevstoupením je to Jeho poslední slovo. A když to řekl, zatímco ho pozorovali, byl vyzdvižen a oblak ho přijal z jejich očí.<br/>A když se dívali k nebi, když vystupoval, hle, stáli u nich dva muži v bílém rouchu.<br/>Předpokládáme, že to byli andělé.<br/>Kterýž také řekl: Muži Galilejští, proč stojíte a hledíte do nebe? Tentýž Ježíš, kterýž jest vzat od vás do nebe, tak přijde, jakž jste ho viděli jíti do nebe.<br/>Viděli ho, jak vystoupil na nebesa, a uvidí ho, až se vrátí. "Hle, Pán přichází s desetitisíci svých svatých, aby vykonal soud na zemi" (Soud 1:14-15). K tomu, který nás miloval a dal se za nás, a který nás učinil našemu Bohu, králům a kněžím, kteří s ním budou kralovat na zemi, hle, přichází Pán a spatří ho každé oko; i ti, kteří ho probodli, budou kvílit. Tak přichází Pán. Uvidí ho každé oko. Svědkové Jehovovi říkají, že už přišel, ale byl to tajný příchod. Protože to byli jen učedníci, kteří ho viděli jít, byli to jen učedníci svědků Jehovových, kteří ho viděli vrátit se. Ježíš však řekl: "Jestliže vám řeknou: 'Přišel tajně a vešel do tajné komnaty, nevěřte tomu'" (Mt 24,26).<br/>Tentýž Ježíš, který je vzat od vás do nebe, přijde tak, jak jste ho viděli jít do nebe.<br/>Nyní je velmi zajímavý verš v II Jan, verš Skutky 1: 7 , "Pro mnoho podvodníků jsou vstoupili do světa, kteří nevyznávají, že Ježíš Kristus přišel v těle." To, bohužel, je špatný překlad řečtiny. Neboť toto příčestí je v přítomném čase a mělo by být přeloženo jako "přichází v těle." Ti, kteří by popírali, že Ježíš Kristus přichází v těle. Co o nich říká Jan? "Jsou svůdce a antikrist. Pohleďte sami na sebe, abychom neztratili to, co jsme vykonali, ale abychom obdrželi plnou odměnu; neboť každý, kdo přestupuje a nezůstává v Kristově učení, nemá Boha. Kdo zůstává v nauce Kristově, má Otce i Syna. A přijde-li někdo k vašim dveřím (v sobotu ráno) a nepřinese-li tuto nauku, nepřijímejte ho do svého domu a ani se s ním nerozlučujte. Neboť ten, kdo se s ním loučí, se podílí na jeho zlých skutcích“ (2J 1, 7-11). Zeptejte se jich na jednu otázku: “Přichází Ježíš v těle?” Jen se jich zeptejte na tuto otázku. A pokud řeknou ne, jen si vzpomeňte, co vás Jan varoval a co vám Jan řekl. "Jestliže někdo nevyznává, že Ježíš Kristus přichází v těle." Vzpomínáte si, když byl s učedníky a řekl: "Dejte mi něco k jídlu?" Řekl: "Víte, duchové nejedí, dotkněte se mě. Vidíte? To jsem já." Takže tentýž Ježíš přichází znovu stejným způsobem, jakým ho viděli jít do nebe. A já za jednoho věřím, že tento příchod je velmi brzy.<br/>Potom se vrátili do Jeruzaléma z hory zvané Olivetská, která je z Jeruzaléma na sobotní cestu. A když vcházeli, vstoupili do horního pokoje, kdež bydlil Petr a Jakub, a Jan, a Ondřej, a Filip, a Tomáš, a Bartoloměj, a Matouš, Jakub Alfeův, a Šimon Zélotes, a Juda bratr Jakubův. A ti všichni pokračovali v jedné shodě v modlitbě a úpěnlivé prosbě se ženami a s Marií, matkou Ježíšovou, a s jeho bratry (Skutky 1:12-14).<br/>Toto je poslední zmínka o Marii, matce Ježíšově. V tomto bodě a od tohoto bodu, není o ní žádná další zmínka ve Skutcích apoštolů nebo v epištolách. Žádná zmínka o její smrti nebo o jejím zázračném výstupu do nebe, bez smrti. V Písmu není nic zmiňováno, je to mlčení.<br/>Jeho bratři by pravděpodobně odkazovali na Jakuba a Judu a na ty další bratry, kteří byli syny Josefa a Marie.<br/>Horní místnost - někteří říkají, že je to tatáž horní místnost, ve které měl Ježíš Poslední večeři se svými učedníky. A přesto jsou jiní, kteří se drží této horní místnosti, která je místností v chrámových okrscích, kde se scházela raná církev. Vyber si.<br/>A v těch dnech se Petr postavil uprostřed učedníků a řekl: (počet jejich jmen dohromady bylo asi sto dvacet) mužů a bratří, toto Písmo se muselo naplnit, což Duch Svatý ústy Davidovými mluvil o Jidášovi, který byl vodítkem pro ty, kteří Ježíše přijali.<br/>Zde opět, Petr stále stejně zbrklý, čekají v modlitbách a úpěnlivých prosbách, a Petr vstane a říká: "Spolu, je tu Písmo, které se musí naplnit." A víte, že se pohne kupředu, "Pojďme spustit program, vrhejme losy a zjistime, kdo zaujme Jidášovo místo." Mám pocit, že Petr byl opět v těle a projevoval tu prudkou povahu, která byla jeho. A myslím, že budoucí dějiny církve v knize Skutků na to poukazují. Zajímá mě, jak Petr chápe písma, jak to, že cituje z tolika míst ve Starém zákoně. Petr projevuje velmi velké porozumění starozákonním písmům, což je bod v jeho prospěch.<br/>Všimněte si, že Petr připisuje Duchu svatému to, co napsal David. Tak, "Celé Písmo je dáno z Božího vnuknutí" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Není součástí písem. Protože když mi řeknete, že část Písma je dána inspirací od Boha, pak se vás musím zeptat: "Které části jsou inspirací a které části nejsou inspirací?" A pak jste autorita, která mi říká, které části mohu věřit a které části nemohu věřit, a ve chvíli, kdy už Bůh není autoritou, ale vy jste autoritou, jsem v potížích. Dávejte si pozor na ty, kteří říkají: "Nuže, nemůžete věřit všem Písmům." Písmo samo říká: "Veškeré Písmo je dáno z vnuknutí Božího." A tady Lukáš píše o tom, co Petr říkal, a prohlašuje, že David byl ve skutečnosti mluvčím Ducha svatého. Duch svatý z Davidových úst mluvil o Jidášovi.<br/>Neboť byl počítán s námi, [byl] jeden ze dvanácti, který získal část této služby. Ale nyní tento člověk koupil pole za odměnu nepravosti a padl na hlavu (Skutky 1:17-18).<br/>Vykoupil pole, hrnčířovo pole, jak to oznamuje Zachariáš v jedenácté kapitole.<br/>A padna, roztrhl se u prostřed, a vytryskla všecka střeva jeho“ (Skutky 1:18).<br/>Jsou tací, kteří najdou rozpor v Písmu, protože v jednom z evangelií je nám řečeno, že když se Jidáš vrátil a pokusil se vrátit peníze, řekli: "Hej, to je tvůj problém. Nemůžeme to vzít." A dali to zpátky do chrámové pokladnice. "Jsou to krvavé peníze." Pak je hodil na podlahu chrámu a vyšel ven a oběsil se. Zde nám Petr říká, že padl střemhlav a jen se objevil. A jsou tu tací, kteří si představují rozpor. Velmi jednoduché, šel nahoru do stromu, aby se oběsil, uvázal lano kolem krku a přivázal ho k končetině a skočil. A síla pádu buď zlomila lano nebo hlavu a spadl do kaňonu a stejně jako to řekl tady.<br/>Všem obyvatelům Jeruzaléma bylo známo, že se jejich jazykem nazývá pole Aceldama, to znamená pole krve. Neboť je psáno v knize Žalmů: Ať je jeho příbytek zpustošený a ať v něm nikdo nebydlí; a jeho biskupství ať si vezme jiný.<br/>Nyní ve skutečnosti cituje ze dvou různých žalmů. Z Žalmu 69:25 to dává dohromady s Žalmem 109:8 . A když je dává dohromady, nachází tato proroctví o Jidášovi.<br/>A protož těchto mužů (Skutky 1:21)<br/>Zde hledají někoho, kdo by zaujal Jidášovo místo jako apoštol. Zde jsou kvalifikace, které v té době hledali.<br/>Protož z těch mužů, kteříž s námi byli po všecken čas, v němž byl Pán Ježíš mezi námi,<br/>Nyní si vzpomínáte, že bylo mnoho učedníků, z nichž Ježíš vybral deset, aby byli apoštoly. A slovo apoštol znamená "ten, který je poslán." Nebo vybral dvanáct, aby byli apoštoly, a tak vyslal dvanáct. Počet lidské vlády. "Máme jen jedenáct. Potřebujeme jednoho, který zaujme Jidášovo místo, ale potřebujeme někoho, kdo je s námi od začátku s Ježíšem."<br/>Od chvíle, kdy byl pokřtěn Janem, až do dne, kdy byl od nás vzat vzhůru, musí být jeden ustanoven, aby byl svědkem jeho vzkříšení (Skutky 1:22).<br/>Takže to byly požadavky, které hledali. Někdo, kdo byl po celou dobu. Od doby Janova křtu až po nanebevstoupení. A ten, kdo viděl vzkříšeného Pána, a tak mohl nést skutečnost vzkříšení, jejich svědectví o tom.<br/>Nyní Pavel apoštol, později v tvrzení, že byl apoštol řekl, "Což jsem neviděl vzkříšeného Krista?" Evidentně to byl jeden z požadavků apoštolství. Někdo se mě zeptal: "Existují apoštolové dnes?" No, nevím. Nemyslím si, že jsou ve stejném smyslu, jako byli v Novém zákoně. Jistě není dnes nikdo, kdo by mohl svědčit o vzkříšení jako oni.<br/>Ustanovili dva, Josefa zvaného Barsabas, který se jmenoval Justus, a Matyáše. I modlili se a řekli: "Ty, Pane, který znáš srdce všech lidí, ukaž, zda jsi z těch dvou, které sis vyvolil,<br/>Myslím, že často děláme tuto chybu, že dáváme Pánu dvě možnosti, obě špatné. Omezit Boha, víte. Jsme tak náchylní to udělat. Očividně, Paul byl Boží volba. Peter byl zbrklý a skočil z pistole a řekl: "Hej, musíme něco udělat, víš, musíme pomoct Bohu, jeden chybí a my ho musíme vyplnit." A přesto, "Bože, kterého z těch dvou chceš?" A dal Bohu dvě možnosti.<br/>aby se mohl účastnit této služby a tohoto apoštolství, z něhož Jidáš pro přestoupení vypadl, aby mohl jít na své místo. A tak vydali své losy (Skutky 1:25-26);<br/>Zajímavý způsob, jakým se snažili určit Boží vůli. Hoďme kostkami, zjistěte, co je Boží vůle. Je to pro mě zajímavé, různé způsoby, které lidé vymysleli, aby poznali Boží vůli. Ve starozákonních dobách měli zajímavý způsob, jak přijít ke knězi, který se za ně ptal Pána skrze Urim a Thumim, "světla a dokonalosti." Nevíme, co to bylo za Urim a Thumim. Jsem si jistý, že to nebyly barevné brýle, které Joseph Smith našel u Zlatých desek; kouzelné brýle, které když si je nasadíte, můžete najednou přečíst hieroglyfické písmo.<br/>Někteří říkají, že Urim a Thumim byli ve skutečnosti černý a bílý kámen, který byl nošen v kapse na hrudi kněze. Modlili se a ptali se Pána na konkrétní otázku. Vzpomínáš si, že David se Hospodina tázal: "Pane, půjdeme proti Pelištejcům?" Odpověď zněla: "Ne." Druhý den tedy znovu: "Pane, půjdeme proti Pelištejcům?" Odpověď zněla: "Ano." "Kdy půjdeme?" Ptali se na konkrétní otázky a Pán je vedl přes Urim a Thummin. Říkají, že kněz se bude modlit, hledat Boha a pak natáhnout a vytáhnout jeden ze dvou kamenů. Pokud to byl bílý kámen, byla to odpověď ano. Pokud by to bylo ne, pak by to byl černý kámen, který by vytáhl. Někteří dokonce říkají, že dostaneme termín blackballed z tohoto Urimu a Thummimu. Ve skutečnosti, zpět v originále je to nehlasovat proti určitému projektu nebo myšlence. Nevíme, co byli Urim a Thumim, ale během období Starého zákona používali metodu losování, aby určili Boží vůli.<br/>A tak se učedníci chopili stejné věci, jako házeli kostkami, aby viděli, kterého ze dvou mužů, které Bůh vybral, aby nahradil Jidáše Iškariotského.<br/>los padl na Matěje; byl počítán mezi jedenáct (Skutky 1:26).<br/>Kdo na světě je Matthias? Nikdo o něm nikdy neslyšel. Bude zajímavé setkat se s Matthiasem a zjistit, kdo je a co udělal. Myslím, že z následné historie je zřejmé, že Bůh si vybral Pavla jako apoštola. Pavel to sám prohlašuje. Nyní je to naposledy, co o nich čteme, že se snaží rozpoznat Boží vůli tím, že losují nebo náhodou něco takového.<br/>Znám jednoho člověka, který se dnes snaží rozeznat Pánovu vůli a bude se modlit a pokládat Pánu otázku. V kapse bude mít deset haléřů, a jak se modlí, vezme haléře se zavřenýma očima a položí je na stůl, a když přijdou všechny hlavy, je to ano. Zajímavá věc, jednou za čas, všichni přijdou na hlavy, a to je docela dobrá šance. Přesto, nenajdeme žádný vzor pro to poté, co byl dán Duch svatý. Jakmile Duch svatý přišel na církev, Duch svatý k nim začal mluvit a řídit je. A Duch svatý řekl: "Oddělte mi Pavla a Barnabáše pro službu, kde jsem je povolal" (Skutky 13:2). A Duch svatý je poslal. Tak najdeme církev více přímo vedena Duchem svatým. Jakmile Duch svatý přišel, tento házení kostky zjistit Boží vůli byl odložen stranou.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James verze<br/><br/>Toto je 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (také známý jako autorizovaná verze). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Stalinova opozice uvnitř strany, včetně Bucharina, Jagody a Rykova, byla v těchto předváděcích procesech očištěna, protože je Stalin manipulativně nutil přiznat se ke zločinům plánování převratu a odporu vůči státu, i když nebyl žádný důkaz. Gabor T Rittersporn řekl: "Mnoho obětí bylo upřímně oddáno principům bolševismu." To zesiluje důkaz, že bolševické ideály, které byly kdysi kořeny komunistické strany, byly čistkami rozházeny a zničeny. Strana byla vyčerpaná a bývalí členové bezmocně sledovali, jak Stalin používá velkou čistku jako nástroj k přeměně Ruska z jednoho stranického státu na nezpochybnitelnou diktaturu. Očistce opět otřásaly rámcem komunistické strany, zformované během bolševické revoluce. To souhlasí se zdrojem "Stalin kat", protože oba ukazují manipulativní charakter, který pomohl diktátorovi zvýšit sevření ruského krku.<br/>Manipulativní způsob, jímž Stalin v očích obyčejných Rusů obviňoval svou cílenou opozici během čistek, měl také implozivní dopad na sovětskou společnost. Stalin byl schopen shromáždit podporu od lidí pomocí propagandy a médií, aby mu pomohl rozvíjet "kultu osobnosti" a obraz hrdinného a statečného vůdce.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell je nervfing rvačky místo nervfing hvězdné síly. Byl jsem na 750 minulou sezónu s výkonem 8 nita a je velmi těžké projít, že, jako, hvězdné síly hrají opravdu dominantní roli. Dohazování je také odpad. Když hraji gem grab (kolem 600 trofejí), jsou často zápasy, kde má nepřátelský tým o jednoho hráče více než my, a to není ani to, že máme lvl 9, abychom mohli soutěžit proti tomu. Někdy jsou dokonce i zápasy, kde je nepřátelský tým plně maximalizován a nikdo z nás není. to je důvod, proč už vážně nehraji bojové hvězdy. Není to ani tak, že není mnoho hráčů, kteří nejsou maximalizováni a kolem 600 trofejí. Je to nepříjemné.<br/>EDIT: Myslím, že superbuňka by měla mít alespoň základní mechanismus, který bere průměr úrovní rváčů při nastavování zápasů.<br/><br/>Až na to, že trofeje nenaznačují tvé schopnosti, ale schopnosti spoluhráčů, se kterými jsi zařazen, a mně nevadí hrát proti rváčům na vyšší úrovni, ale když je jeden tým na úrovni 10 a druhý ne, je to očividně nevyvážené.<br/><br/>Doporučuji získat nějaké dobré přátele, se kterými si můžeme hrát, já a 2 přátelé dostali moji přátelé 1 klíště na 28. místo tím, že hrajeme gem grab s určitým složením po celý den a zvládli jsme to, aniž by jeden z nás byl maxed s našimi brawlery.<br/><br/>Vím, jak se cítíte, že jsem měl rvačky ve vysokých trofejích s nízkou úrovní a je těžké jít dál a všechno, co jsem si říkal "Chci mít hvězdné síly", opravdu potřebuje superbuňka, aby vyvážila hvězdné síly nebo alespoň vytvořila lepší systém dohazování.<br/><br/>Cítím to. Nejsem tak dobrý ve hře jako vy, ale dostal jsem Emz na 500 při síle 1 a dohazování bylo hrozné. Maxed hráčů všude! A nepomohlo to, že většina mých spoluhráčů měla kolem 5-8k trofejí... Musel jsem se uchýlit k souboji na poslední chvíli, protože mohu buď přepadnout nic netušící hráče, nebo prostě hrát trochu agresivně ve správný čas. Ale opravdu si přeji, aby to bylo trochu jednodušší pro lidi, kteří chtějí tlačit rváče na opravdu vysoké trofeje, aniž by měli luxus hvězdných sil.<br/><br/>Altho hrot je stále dobrý bez curveballu. Curveball byl jen nápovědou pro častější údery do vašich ran jako hrot. Ale ještě předtím, než byl curveball propuštěn, byl hrot opravdu silný rváč, takže zůstane stejný.<br/><br/>Souhlasím s tím, že by měli mít nervy přepadení, ale myslím, že se snaží vyvážit jak Snappy Sniping a Ambush, protože oba jsou stále sloučeny s touto změnou. Stávala se trochu silná, ale stále není nerf-hodné<br/><br/>Nejsem si tím jistý, ale teď, když Darryl dostal nápadný buff, při pohledu na jejich nové statistiky, vypadá to, že Darryl by mohl Bulla zastínit, protože nejenže může vždy způsobit více škody než Bull, už nezemře tak brzy, takže jejich přežití bude podobné bez hvězdné síly (ačkoli Bullova přežití je stále znatelně lepší než Darrylova, kdyby měl Tough Guy). A nejen to, Darrylův super hrdina se dokáže samoobnovit, což znamená, že Darryl Might může být efektivně hrán jako těžký a zároveň zabiják (než se naštve jako těžký, ale slušný jako zabiják).<br/><br/>Ale on je přeceňuje af. A dostanete trofeje s ním opravdu snadno. Takže jsem trochu v pořádku s nervem. Dokonce jsem ho hrál od té doby, co jsem ho dostal do 500 (asi před 5 měsíci), takže ne, že bych se moc staral.<br/><br/>Proč Poco/Penny nedostane HP nerf, pokud jsou Marksman/Healer resp. ne tank?<br/>Proč není Rosina tankyness nervózní, kašel 70% snížení poškození?<br/>Proč je povoleno, aby Tick měl nejvyšší rozsah a nejvíce volného pokedamage v celé hře?<br/>Proč Leon nemá HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Ať už je to jakkoli, byl to Ambush, který byl OP, ne základna Piper. Tvrdil bych, že Ambush je nejlepší hvězdnou silou ve hře (nyní ještě více, protože procento nárůstu škod nepřímo vzrostlo) a základna Piper byla spodní-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Superbuňka by měla vrátit obě nervy, snížit Ambush na 600 a snížit Snappy Sniping na 0,25, protože by byla nepřímo nafouknutá základním poškozením.<br/><br/>Ano a já věřím, že zašli trochu příliš daleko s Rosou, protože teď je v podstatě lepší býk, pokud jde o tankování, což už nějakou dobu je. Darryl by mohl být menší, silnější býk<br/><br/>Proč? Mám pocit, že potřebuje nadšení téměř ve všem kromě její hvězdné síly. Její zdraví a rychlost ji činí super trochu obtížnější, protože může zemřít docela snadno a je pro ni opravdu obtížné zachytit rychlejší rváče jako Crow. Její hvězdná síla je trochu zlomená, i když... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Self-employment část 1<br/><br/>Když přijmete zaměstnání v jakékoli organizaci, musíte vykonávat různé práce podle požadavků svého zaměstnavatele a můžete získat pevnou výši příjmu jako plat. Můžete provozovat malou prodejnu, krejčovství, restauraci, pekařství a cukrovinky, salon krásy atd. Ve vaší lokalitě se můžete zapojit do obchodování nebo výroby v malém měřítku nebo poskytovat nějaké služby za cenu. Takové ekonomické činnosti se nazývají samostatné výdělečné činnosti.<br/><br/>Význam samozaměstnání<br/><br/>Náš otec, matka, bratři, sestry a další mohou být zapojeni do různých ekonomických činností, jejichž prostřednictvím si vydělávají na živobytí. Tyto osoby jsou zapojeny do ekonomické činnosti, která se nazývá mzdové zaměstnání nebo placené zaměstnání. Existuje však mnoho osob, které se zabývají povoláním nebo nějakým podnikem, které samy zakládají a řídí. Vynakládají maximální úsilí a riskují vše, aby se úspěšně věnovali své kariéře. Celý výdělek z jejich práce jde na ně. Všichni jsme viděli malé obchody s potravinami, krejčovství, lékařské obchody atd. V naší lokalitě. Ty jsou vlastněny a řízeny osobou, s pomocí nebo bez pomoci některých asistentů. Jejich ekonomická činnost se nazývá samostatná výdělečná činnost. Takže když se jednotlivec zapojí do jakékoli ekonomické činnosti a spravuje ji sám, je známá jako samostatná výdělečná činnost.<br/><br/>Cíle<br/><br/>Po prostudování této lekce budete moci:<br/><br/>Obrázek cílů<br/><br/>Obrázek cílů<br/><br/>Charakteristika samostatného zaměstnání<br/><br/>Jedná se o vlastnictví a řízení činností osobou, ačkoli může požádat o pomoc jednu nebo dvě osoby, aby mu pomohly. Samostatná výdělečná činnost tak může poskytnout zaměstnání i jiným osobám.<br/><br/>Výdělek ze samostatné výdělečné činnosti není pevný. Závisí na příjmu, který lze získat výrobou nebo nákupem a prodejem zboží nebo poskytováním služeb ostatním za cenu.<br/><br/>V samostatné výdělečné činnosti musí vlastník sám převzít zisk a nést riziko ztráty. Takže najdeme přímou souvislost mezi úsilím a odměnou v samostatné výdělečné činnosti.<br/><br/>To vyžaduje určité množství kapitálových investic, i když to může být malé.<br/><br/>Při samostatné výdělečné činnosti může osoba svobodně rozhodovat o tom, jak bude své podnikání provozovat se ziskem, a využít jakékoli příležitosti, která by mohla nastat pro rozšíření jejího podnikání. Dává naprostou svobodu pracovat podle své vlastní vůle a v rámci parametrů převládajících zákonů.<br/><br/>Samostatná výdělečná činnost může být definována jako ekonomická činnost, kterou může člověk vykonávat samostatně jako výdělečné povolání, a ta může spočívat v výrobě a prodeji zboží, nákupu a prodeji zboží nebo poskytování služeb za cenu. |
