| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

Hlavním cílem tohoto typu poezie je vytvářet básně prostřednictvím spolupráce různých autorů/básníků, snažících se utvořit jednotný hlas při zachování jejich individuálních hlasů.<br/><br/>Příklady spolupráce jsou v japonské poezii hojné, ačkoli přesné záznamy o mnoha takových událostech jsou buď ztraceny, nebo chybí.<br/><br/>Jedním z nejznámějších příkladů kolektivního básnického psaní byla básnická sbírka Ralentir Travaux surrealistických francouzských básníků André Bretona, Paula Éluarda a René Chara. Tito tři básníci spolupracovali na psaní básní v této sbírce během pouhých pěti dnů v roce 1930.<br/><br/>Během čtyřicátých let vynalezl americký básník Charles Henri Ford to, co nazval "řetězovou básní", kde každý básník napsal řádek a poté poslal báseň jiné osobě (aby pokračovala) v jiné části světa, poštou.<br/><br/>V roce 2007 sbírku americké kolaborativní poezie Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry editovali a publikovali Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton a David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Kolaborativní psaní poezie byla použita ve školách a vysokých školách učit studenty týmové práce a objevovat způsoby, ve kterých jsou spojeny.<br/><br/>Studie figury venku: Žena se slunečníkem, obrácená doleva, 1886<br/><br/>Obrázky, zvuky či videa k tématu Claude Monet ve Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Cíl tohoto článku a jak přistupovat k výzvě<br/><br/>Před několika lety jsem napsal článek s názvem "Báseň bez konce", který zahrnoval vánoční báseň, kterou jsem napsal, že jsem se přidal. Byl jsem ohromen odpovědí, protože v té fázi jsem zde měl jen několik následovníků. Lidé napsali sloku poezie každý v "komentářích" na rozbočovači, aby navázali na předchozí sloku komentátora. Vyšlo to velmi dobře a na konci jsem sestavil všechny příspěvky do jedné básně jako součást rozbočovače.<br/><br/>Podobné výzvy byly vydány od té doby, včetně jednoho Frank Atanacio s názvem "Spirits Sat as Mourners", který byl také velmi úspěšný. Rozdíl je v tom, že v tomto případě přispěvatelé napsali své vlastní centrum pro svou poezii a umístili odkaz na původní centrum Franka.<br/><br/>Pro tuto konkrétní výzvu neočekávám, že každý bude trávit drahocenný čas psaním samostatných rozbočovačů pro jednu sloku poezie (pokud to opravdu nechcete). Hlavním problémem je, že abyste to zefektivnili, museli byste zkopírovat dříve napsané části básně do svého rozbočovače a pravděpodobně byste byli zasaženi štítkem "duplikace".<br/><br/>Takže to je případ, a také ušetřit museli nechat odkazy všude, jen žádám, aby každý, kdo se chce zúčastnit jen napsat svou stanza zde v "komentáře." Zkontrolujte poslední komentář před vámi, který přispívá k výzvě a pokračovat dál. Pokud uvidím více než jednoho následovníka ze stejné sloky, použiji svou básnickou licenci, abych je zpracoval tak, jak považuji za nejlepší.<br/><br/>V určité fázi, kdy mám pocit, že bylo přidáno dost sloek, pravděpodobně ukončím výzvu a pak je všechny sestavím jako dokončenou báseň jako součást článku (také připisuji zásluhy každému přispěvateli).<br/><br/>Květina Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Obrázky, zvuky či videa k tématu Claude Monet ve Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Výzva!<br/><br/>Teď přichází ta zajímavá část. Pokud se připojíte k této řetězové básnické výzvě, musíte se pokusit udržet styl a hlas básně co nejblíže k předchozím veršům, aby se neinformovaným čtenářům zdálo, že celou báseň napsal pouze jeden autor.<br/><br/>Zní to jednoduše, říkáte? No možná by to bylo, kdyby báseň měla tradiční styl, rým nebo metr. Ale tohle ne! Báseň, ke které budete přidávat, byla zahájena mým známým Andriealphusem jako "řetězová básnická výzva" jinde. V době psaní jsem byl jediný další člověk, který přijal výzvu, a protože jsem miloval toto téma, myslel jsem si, že to bude velká výzva pro mé kolegy spisovatele a rozhodl jsem se ji použít zde a uvidíme, jestli odpověď bude lepší. (Vím o několika básnících, jejichž psaní by vyhovovalo tomuto stylu.)<br/><br/>Pravidla :<br/><br/>Následovat z předchozí stanza v komentářích<br/><br/>Snažte se zachovat hlas a styl básně<br/><br/>Udržujte svou sloku/verš přibližně ve stejné délce jako ty předchozí.<br/><br/>Claude Monet byl jedním z nejslavnějších malířů v dějinách umění a vůdčí postavou impresionistického hnutí.<br/><br/>V roce 1883 se Monet přestěhoval do Giverny. Zde miloval malování venku v zahradách, které pomáhal vytvářet. Lekníny nalezené v rybníku měly zvláštní přitažlivost a on jich maloval několik sérií po celý zbytek svého života; most v japonském stylu přes rybník se stal také předmětem několika děl.<br/><br/>V roce 1912 Monet namaloval sérii 12 leknínů, které si objednalo muzeum Orangerie des Tuileries v Paříži. Rozhodl se je vyrobit ve velmi velkém měřítku a sloužit jako "útočiště klidné meditace". Tento projekt pohltil většinu Monetových pozdějších let. Monet jednou prohlásil: "Tyto krajiny vody a reflexe se pro mě staly posedlostí. Je to mimo mé síly jako starého muže, a přesto chci vyjádřit to, co cítím."<br/><br/>Jeho zdraví bylo nyní také překážkou. Téměř slepý, s oběma očima vážně postiženými kataraktou, Monet nakonec souhlasil, že podstoupí operaci pro onemocnění v roce 1923.<br/><br/>Monetovy slavné lekníny zčervenaly, jak jeho katarakta postupovala. Poté, co dostal nápravnou operaci, zničil většinu obrazů "červené lilie", rozzlobený, že se mu o tom nikdo nezmínil. Je ironií, že tyto obrazy byly pravděpodobně to, co dělalo jeho impresionistický styl tak slavný v té době - umělci začali více riskovat s barvami a podobně během tohoto bodu.<br/><br/>Mistrovské dílo<br/><br/>Chlapec, který sedí za vámi, říká, že vypadáte jako mistrovské dílo.<br/><br/>Zeptejte se ho, viděl někdy Moneta zblízka?<br/><br/>Dostatečně blízko, aby neviděli nic jiného než zamotané tahy trávy na břehu jezera?<br/><br/>Dostatečně blízko, aby ponořil prsty do hřebenů<br/><br/>kde olejové barvy ztvrdly pod umělcovým pohledem?<br/><br/>Dostatečně blízko, aby se nadechla na krevní lilie?<br/><br/>Zeptej se ho, proč je namaloval na červeno?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Zasmál se jako Carrollova kočka z Cheshire.<br/><br/>"Přes zakalené a krvavé oči, které si představuji.<br/><br/>Buď mé lekníny!" povídá:<br/><br/>"Pociť můj dech a nech mé prsty se ponořit,<br/><br/>Místo toho se staň mým mistrovským dílem.<br/><br/>Kartáček se nikdy nedotkl plátna tak jemného, jako je vaše světlá kůže.<br/><br/>Ať se páni rozpláčou v žárlivosti,<br/><br/>a van Gogh si v závisti uřízne ucho nad krásou tvé nahoty.“ (Jodah)<br/><br/>Autoportrét s ovázaným uchem<br/><br/>Obrázky, zvuky či videa k tématu Vincent van Gogh ve Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Odpovědi<br/><br/>Nyní je řada na vás.

Dělal jsem, co jsem mohl, abych je zařídil, jak si myslím, že nejlépe s malou editací. Dokončenou báseň pravděpodobně zveřejním jako samostatný rozbočovač s odkazem na tento. Moje kniha je k dispozici na Lulu a iBooks ... tam je odkaz na jeden z předchozích komentářů. Byl bych opravdu ocenil, kdybyste si kopii. Mějte na paměti, že je to můj první eBook, takže formátování atd. Není dokonalé, ale trvalo mi sedm revizí, myslím, že to dostanu tam, kde to je. Příště to bude jednodušší. Pokud potřebujete pomoc, dejte mi vědět.<br/><br/>travmaj z austrálie dne 12. srpna 2015:<br/><br/>Ahoj Johne, určitě jsi měl nějaké vynikající reakce na tvou výzvu - jsem si jistý, že ji krásně spojíš, i když si představuji obtížný úkol.

Původně byly v různých formátech, jeden ePub, druhý PDF, ale nyní jsou oba ePub. Jsou k dispozici prostřednictvím Lulu a iBooks, brzy Barnes a Noble a Nook (ne Amazon). Možná se brzy pokusím vydat další knihu prostřednictvím Amazonu, abych zjistil, jak to srovnává. Ještě jednou díky.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Velká Británie 11. srpna 2015:<br/><br/>Johne, díky moc, informace o publikování s Lulu budou docela užitečné, protože přemýšlím o publikování, ale v současné době jsem mezi Amazonem a Lulu. Chtěl jsem si koupit jednu z vašich knih, ale zdálo se, že jsem je na Amazonu nenašel. Nicméně, nejspíš to dostanu od Lulu a přeju ti hodně úspěchů, zasloužíš si to.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land dne 11. srpna 2015:<br/><br/>Ahoj Phyllis, díky za přispění.

Jen čekám, jestli je ještě něco přidat. Publikování s Lulu nebylo špatné a teď, když jsem to udělal jednou, bude to příště jednodušší. Získání formátování vypadat přímo v eBook byl nejtěžší, i když a stačí zadat do textového dokumentu a Lulu automaticky vytvoří obsah stránky a převede dokument do ePub nebo PDF můžete použít pouze určitá písma a musí se ujistit, že názvy kapitol nebo názvů básní jsou v Nadpisu 1. Poskytují také bezplatné číslo ISBN, pokud chcete. Celkově to však bylo jednodušší, než se očekávalo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues z Lincolnshire, Velká Británie 11. srpna 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, tohle je stručné a krásné, líbí se mi to.

Jak jste našli proces publikování s Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) z Gondwana Land dne 10. srpna 2015:<br/><br/>Ne, ještě není pozdě, stále skládám poslední báseň, takže by měla být k vidění za den nebo dva.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper z jižních USA dne 10. srpna 2015:<br/><br/>Ahoj Johne,<br/><br/>Omlouvám se za svůj pozdní podání zde na vaší nádherné výzvě.

Bohužel musím plakat. Jsem trochu pod vlivem počasí s hlavou plnou vaty, nebo to tak vypadá. Pokud je výzva stále otevřená, když se zbavím této otravné chřipky, mohu to zkusit, ale musím říct, že standard je mimořádně vysoký. Maj to vzal na jinou úroveň, ale všechny příspěvky jsou brilantní.

Nejsem si jistý, že jsem napsal pokračování ze sloky před (vždyzkoumání), ale jsem si jistý, že ji zcela spojíte, až přijde čas. Miluji všechny odpovědi. Nestihla jsem žádné kreativní psaní pro yonky, nemůžu se dočkat, až začnu znovu, jen potřebuji nějaký čas. (Beats sledování kriketu taky!!!)

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | V první řadě musí být EEQT sám dále rozvíjen, aby poskytl teoretickou a výpočetní odpověď na potřeby moderního kvantového inženýrství a technologie. Musíme zahrnout klasické systémy s nekonečnými počty stupňů volnosti - jako elektromagnetické a / nebo gravitační pole. Musíme také zahrnout nekonečné kvantové systémy, abychom pochopili a simulovali Boseho plyn a jeho fázové přechody. Existují však i kroky, které je třeba podniknout daleko za paradigmatem EEKT.<br/>Jak jsme již tolikrát zdůraznili: kvantová teorie musí být teprve pochopena v pojmech "nelineární klasické teorie". Ale to, co máme na mysli pod "klasickou teorií", je něco mnohem pokročilejšího a obecnějšího než klasická mechanika nebo klasická teorie pole. Klasickou teorií rozumíme především teorii, která není založena na pravděpodobnostech od začátku; teorii, v níž se pravděpodobnosti objevují v pozdější fázi, odvozené z teorie; odvozené možná nezbytným způsobem. Taková teorie musí nejen specifikovat matematické objekty a jejich vztahy, ale také vytvářet "předpovědi".<br/>Klasická teorie je teorie, ve které se mohou odehrávat diskrétní události, události, které jsou "objektivní". Mohou to být události, které ovlivňují především fyzickou vrstvu, ale mohou to být také "duševní události", změny stavů "vědomí"; ať už jsou jakékoli, i když se zabývají větvením vesmírů - STAJÍ SE.<br/>Taková teorie, zahrnující kvantovou teorii, jak ji známe dnes, ještě neexistuje, ale můžeme si představit její možný tvar. Nic neslouží lépe než příklad, takže uveďme příklad, jak lze takovou teorii vyložit.<br/>Představte si, že teorie vyvinula Einsteinovu jednotnou teorii pole, ale s variabilním metrickým podpisem, možná se složitou kauzální pavučinou, násobkem<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (viz také [41]) mosty, časové smyčky, nediferencovatelnost, fraktální struktura, to vše navíc komplikována proměnlivou dimenzí prostoru a "času" (srov. [42]. Představte si takovou teorii, která by byla schopna pojmout všechny čtyři základní síly, které známe, ale zahrnuje také další pole, které se liší od fyzikálních polí a které je nelokální v tom smyslu, že nepřežije, když vezme makro-průměrný limit, když se obnoví kauzální časoprostorová struktura Einsteinovy obecné teorie relativity. Toto další pole by bylo místem pro "myšlenkové formy" a naše teorie by spojila tyto myšlenkové formy s více "fyzickými" úrovněmi reality.<br/>"Čas" by vznikl pouze v jedné konkrétní omezující struktuře. Nic nebrání teorii takového typu, aby měla matematické struktury dostatečně bohaté na to, aby vyhovovaly vědomí a mysli. Vzhledem ke své složitosti, hustotě časových smyčk, bublinové kauzální struktuře, vytváření předpovědí v takové teorii je možné pouze použitím pravděpodobnosti -<br/>Jak je tomu u systémů vyvíjejících se podle deterministické, ale chaotické dynamiky. Kvantová vlnová funkce by se v takové teorii objevila jako efektivní způsob předpovídání. Tento typ vysvětlení kvantového indeterminismu byl před dlouhou dobou postulován I.<br/>[3] spekuloval, že kvantový indeterminismus může být pochopen, pokud připustíme, že jednotlivé kvantové události, které se skutečně dějí zde a nyní, mají i budoucí pokročilé příčiny, mají za sebou také retardované příčiny.<br/>Alanu Turingovi se mohlo stát, že zahlédl takovou myšlenku, když napsal svou slavnou, již citovanou větu: "Předpovědi musí být lineární, popis musí být nelineární."<br/>Teorie jdoucí částečně tímto směrem je vyvíjena L.<br/>[43] který uvádí, že pozorování, připisované Feynmanovi, "typické cesty kvantově mechanických částic jsou spojité nediferencovatelné." Kvantové chování se v této teorii stává projevem fraktální geometrie časoprostoru, stejně jako gravitace je v Einsteinově teorii obecné (pohybové) relativity projevem zakřivení časoprostoru.<br/>Další krok v tomto směru pochází z práce ruských vědců - která začala s nejoriginálnějšími myšlenkami N.A. Kozyreva [44]<br/>a A. Sacharov [45], a vyvíjí se v Moskvě, na Uralu a Sibiři, viz např. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Nejlepší výživa a cvičení pro hubnutí<br/><br/>Jak je snídaně opravdu zdravá?<br/><br/>Ráno jako císař, v poledne jako král, večer jako žebrák – zní známé přísloví. Studie lékařské organizace Endokrinní společnost potvrzuje klíčové poselství za přísloví: To ukazuje, že snídaně hraje důležitější roli, než se často předpokládá. V dopoledních hodinách má lidské tělo více než dvakrát vyšší metabolickou aktivitu než v jiných denních dobách: Velká snídaně vás nejen udržuje plnou po dlouhou dobu, hladina cukru v krvi a inzulínu také pomalu stoupá. Chuť na sladkosti je regulována, jíme občerstvení méně často během dne. Proto by snídaně neměla být vynechána ani během diety.<br/><br/>Samozřejmě, že mít velkou snídani neznamená, že bychom měli mít několik croissantů s ořechovým nugátovým krémem a sladkými snídaňovými palačinkami v dopoledních hodinách. Snídaně je zdravé nejlepší, když je s vysokým obsahem bílkovin a vlákniny, stejně jako poskytování vitamínů a minerálů. Celozrnný chléb nebo můslí, ovesné vločky, ovoce a ořechy jsou dodavatelé energie, které jsou dobré pro vás a udržet si plnou po dlouhou dobu.<br/><br/>Skutečnost, že velká snídaně je lepší než velká večeře, nemusí nutně znamenat, že snídaně je nezbytná pro hubnutí. Metaanalýza provedená v roce 2019 ukázala, že celkový denní příjem energie lidí, kteří snídají, je v průměru vyšší než u těch, kteří nemají snídani. Ty byly v průměru těsně pod půl kila lehčí. Takže podle výsledků této velké studie nemusíte nutně jíst snídani, pokud chcete zhubnout.<br/><br/>Zhubnout se správnou stravou - to je, jak snadné je dát zdravé na talíř<br/><br/>Jíst zdravě v žádném případě neznamená méně chuti. Čerstvá zelenina, ryby nebo maso jako zdroje bílkovin a další zdravé přísady vykouzlí chuť v hrnci a úsměv na rtech - ideálně i když šlápnete na váhu. Americká studie ukázala, že lidé, kteří vaří své vlastní jídlo a vědomě se zabývají tím, co jedí, mají index tělesné hmotnosti v normálním rozmezí. Návštěvy restaurací nebo rychlého občerstvení vás naopak rychle nalákají do pasti na cukr: Často neexistuje žádný náznak toho, kolik cukru je v salátových dresincích, kolik tuku byly brambory smažené nebo zda maso nebylo ošetřeno.<br/><br/>Zdravý oběd se skládá ze tří částí - největší část je ovoce nebo zelenina a měla by pokrýt polovinu talíře. Čtvrtina jídla by měla obsahovat bílkoviny, tj. ryby, maso nebo tofu. Zbývající čtvrtina se skládá ze sacharidů a je ideálně vyrobena z celozrnných výrobků. Důležité: Nejezte u stolu v kanceláři, ale stimulujte metabolismus a ideálně si udělejte krátkou procházku před obědem nebo po obědě.<br/><br/>Kdy byste měli jíst, abyste zhubli?<br/><br/>Ve večerních hodinách byste se měli zaměřit na lehká jídla, která jsou poměrně nízká v sacharidech. Ty jsou nejméně pravděpodobné, že způsobí, že inzulín prudce vzroste, což je dobré pro naše tělo. Zelenina, mléčné výrobky a ořechy jsou pro to vhodné.<br/><br/>Měli byste být také opatrní, abyste neměli večeři příliš pozdě. Nejlepší je jíst až do 19:00 – pak se tělo může uvolnit a připravit se na noc. Dostatek spánku je důležitý pro zdravé hubnutí. Americká studie zjistila, že lidé, kteří spali asi osm hodin denně, měli lepší tukové zásoby. Takže dobrou noc! Dopřejte si více než šest hodin spánku, abyste mohli začít další den fit a osvěžený.<br/><br/>Ztráta hmotnosti bez cvičení - je to opravdu možné?<br/><br/>Bylo by to tak snadné, pokud by bylo možné dosáhnout vysněné hmotnosti jednoduše snížením příjmu kalorií. Ale pravděpodobně víte, že strava je jen jedna strana mince a cvičení je druhá. Takže nic nepomáhá: Nasaďte si sportovní oblečení a jděte!<br/><br/>Každý, kdo kromě sportovního programu, jako je jogging, chůze nebo plavání, také nechá výtah jít sám a jde po schodech, vezme malou objížďku nebo používá kolo místo auta, dělá dobře, je také nazýván něco dobrého. Dokonce i jednoduchá chůze je dobrá pro zdraví. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Proč jsme otevřeli server Anvil App<br/><br/>Proč open source?<br/><br/>Před chvílí jsme otevřeli server Anvil App Server. Reakce komunity byla skvělá, dokonce trochu ohromující (ano, každá odpověď na toto oznámení opravdu přistála v mé schránce!). Už jsme začlenili spoustu této zpětné vazby do našeho vydání verze 1.2. Ale stále se nás ptají: "Proč jste otevřeli takovou základní část vašeho produktu?"<br/><br/>Proč to vůbec děláš?<br/><br/>Anvil je nástroj, který umožňuje co nejjednodušší sestavení webové aplikace. Děláme to tím, že vám umožníme sestavit celou aplikaci v jednom jazyce, Python.<br/><br/>Jednoduchý hosting je toho součástí.<br/><br/>Webová platforma je rozbitá a Anvil je naším pokusem ji opravit. A protože existuje tolik složitosti při nasazování webové aplikace, cloudová služba byla nejlepším způsobem, jak poskytnout jednoduchost, kterou chceme. Tímto způsobem můžete vytvořit aplikaci v editoru Anvil a žít na internetu jedním kliknutím.<br/><br/>Ale pořád jsme slyšeli od lidí, kteří říkali: "To je skvělé, ale..."<br/><br/>"...ale musím to spustit na offshore platformě bez spolehlivého přístupu k internetu"<br/><br/>"...ale chci zabalit svou aplikaci do zařízení IoT, které prodávám"<br/><br/>nebo jednoduše, "...ale když dávám vajíčka do tohoto košíku, jak si mohu být jistý, že mohu stále spustit svou aplikaci za deset let?"<br/><br/>To vše jsou dobré body! Cloudová služba není pro každého tím správným řešením. Pokud chceme těmto uživatelům sloužit, musí existovat nějaký způsob, jak dostat své aplikace z Anvilu a spustit je lokálně, pod svou vlastní úplnou kontrolou.<br/><br/>Open Source: Únikový poklop, ne vystřelovací sedadlo<br/><br/>Věříme v únikové poklopy, ne vystřelovací sedadla. Na konferencích se nás někdy ptají: "Můžu to exportovat jako aplikaci Flask + JS?". Jistě, bylo by to možné – mohli bychom vygenerovat serverový balíček, zkompilovat Python na straně klienta do Javascriptu a vyplivnout klasickou webovou aplikaci. Ale mělo by to vážné nevýhody, protože:<br/><br/>Není to pohodlná jízda.<br/><br/>Generování kódu je vystřelovací sedadlo. Generovaný kód je lepší než nic – alespoň ho můžete upravit! Ale ve chvíli, kdy tento kód upravíte, ztratíte všechny výhody systému, který ho vytvořil. Pokud používáte Anvil kvůli jeho drag-and-drop editoru a Pythonu v prohlížeči, proč by naši lokálně hostovaní uživatelé měli používat vim a Javascript?<br/><br/>Takže jsme to udělali správně: jsme open-source Anvil runtime engine. Je to stejný kód, který slouží vaší aplikaci v naší hostované službě, a představuje vaši aplikaci stejným způsobem. Můžete upravit svůj kód pomocí textového editoru, spustit jej a pak ho git zatlačit zpět do našeho online IDE. Není to vystřelovací sedadlo: neexistuje žádný výbušný přechod. Je to únikový poklop: můžete vylézt ven a vylézt zpět.<br/><br/>A co náš obchodní model?<br/><br/>Anvil nikdy neměl být jedním z těch podnikových systémů s nízkým kódem, které vám účtují 20 dolarů za měsíc za každou osobu, která používá vaši aplikaci. Anvil je vývojářský nástroj. Aplikace, které vyvíjíte, jsou vaše. Umožnit vám je spustit na Raspberry Pi je v pohodě, ale nemění to náš obchodní model.<br/><br/>Děláme to, co jsme vždy dělali: Vyrábíme a prodáváme vývojový nástroj, který výrazně zjednodušuje tvorbu webových aplikací. Poskytujeme hosting pro aplikace Anvil. Pro podnikové zákazníky nabízíme celou vývojovou a hostitelskou platformu. A samozřejmě nabízíme bezplatný plán, aby každý mohl používat Anvil pro hobby nebo vzdělávací účely - nebo začít něco stavět a vidět, jak to jde.<br/><br/>Otevřeli jsme server aplikací Anvil pro (relativně malý) počet lidí, kteří to potřebují, a abychom poskytli konečnou pojistku. Jistě, můžete vytvořit aplikaci s vim a hostitelem sami, aniž byste si u nás zaregistrovali účet (máme dokumenty, které vám ukážou, jak na to!). Ale Anvil Editor je nejjednodušší způsob, jak vytvořit webovou aplikaci na světě, a naše hostovaná služba je nejjednodušší způsob, jak ji nasadit - to je to, co očekáváme, že většina našich uživatelů bude pokračovat. A můžete stavět s důvěrou, protože víte, že open-source kód je právě tam, pokud ho potřebujete.<br/><br/>Vyzkoušejte si to sami<br/><br/>Pokud s vámi rezonuje naše vývojová filozofie, proč nezkusit Anvil sami? |
