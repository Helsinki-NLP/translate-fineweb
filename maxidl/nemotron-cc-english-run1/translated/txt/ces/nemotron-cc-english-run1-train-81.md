| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Před čtyřiceti devíti lety prezident Lyndon B. Johnson podepsal zákon o volebních právech z roku 1965.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Téměř před sto lety, 15. dodatek k ústavě uvedl: "Právo občanů Spojených států hlasovat nesmí být odepřeno nebo zkráceno Spojenými státy nebo jakýmkoli státem z důvodu rasy, barvy nebo předchozí podmínky otroctví." A téměř století před tím, otcové zakladatelé našeho národa uvedli do pohybu velký experiment americké demokracie prohlášením, že "všichni lidé jsou stvořeni sobě rovni."<br/><br/>Zákon o volebních právech z roku 1965 byl opožděným uznáním toho, že i v Americe mají naše základní ideály malou váhu, pokud nejsou chráněny právním státem. To je důvod, proč sekce 2 15. dodatku udělil Kongresu "právo vymáhat tento článek příslušnými právními předpisy."<br/><br/>A skutečně, kodifikovaný jazyk zákona o hlasovacích právech byl schopen dosáhnout toho, co Kongres doby rekonstrukce a Thomas Jefferson nemohl. Zákon o občanských právech z roku 1964 a zákon o volebních právech – a hnutí za občanská práva, z nichž vyšly – sloužily jako katalyzátor dramatického nárůstu příležitostí pro černé Američany k účasti na demokratickém procesu.<br/><br/>Například, pouze 6,7 procenta způsobilých černých Mississippians byly registrovány k hlasování od roku 1962; 1969 toto číslo dosáhlo 66,5 procenta. Dnes, Mississippi má více černých volených úředníků než jakýkoli jiný stát.<br/><br/>Ochrany zavedené zákonem o hlasovacích právech byly dlouho opožděné, když byly schváleny, což bylo představitelem náročného boje, s nímž byly dosaženy. Ale je nepředstavitelné, že tyto ochrany jsou nyní v ohrožení, což ohrožuje pokrok, který náš národ tak tvrdě pracoval, aby dosáhl.<br/><br/>V loňském roce, v případě Shelby County vs. Holder, Nejvyšší soud USA vykuchal klíčovou složku zákona o hlasovacích právech, který umožnil předchozí federální přezkum, aby zajistil nediskriminaci před tím, než vstoupí v platnost jakýkoli nový hlasovací zákon.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Senátor Ted Cruz a guvernér Rick Perry se vydali cestou, aby chválili rozhodnutí Nejvyššího soudu. Senátor Rand Paul odmítl pokračující nutnost zákona o hlasovacích právech tím, že poznamenal: "Máme afroamerického prezidenta."<br/><br/>I když zvolení prezidenta Baracka Obamy bylo skutečně historickým milníkem, je nebezpečné si myslet, že nás zbavuje bdělosti vůči přetrvávajícím důsledkům naší národní minulosti. Spěch, s nímž státy přistoupily k přijetí omezení hlasování, je potvrzením, že ochrana zavedená oddílem 4 je stále nezbytná.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Republikánští guvernéři podepsali přísná foto-identifikační omezení jako řešení prakticky neexistujícího problému zosobnění voličů, neúměrně poškozujícího ženy, mladé lidi, pracující rodiny a afroamerickou komunitu. Je neupřímné, aby republikáni jako Paul usilovali o hlasy těchto komunit, když věří, že "na tom není nic špatného" zavedení omezení, která ztěžují těmto volebním obvodům hlasovat.<br/><br/>Republikáni se také snažili omezit časná volební období, včetně neděle před volbami, kdy afroamerické církve měly velký úspěch s programy Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Tato omezení představují bezcitnou snahu republikánů ztížit hlasování na základě úzkých krátkodobých politických výpočtů, že republikáni mohou vyhrát volby zmenšením velikosti voličů.<br/><br/>Demokraté mají velmi odlišné poslání, pokud jde o hlasování: zajistit, aby se každý oprávněný volič mohl zaregistrovat, aby každý registrovaný volič mohl volit a aby každý hlas byl přesně spočítán.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Projekt rozšíření voličů Demokratického národního výboru odráží naše přesvědčení, že větší účast voličů posiluje náš národ a naši demokracii. Budeme i nadále používat naše bezkonkurenční institucionální znalosti k ochraně hlasovacích práv proti legislativě a taktice, které by se pokusily potlačit hlasování. A protože nejlepší obrana je dobrý útok, pracujeme také na rozšíření hlasování nasazením našich technologií a datových zdrojů k registraci nových voličů.<br/><br/>Na toto výročí, jeden z nejlepších způsobů, jak můžeme ctít ty, kteří bojovali - a v některých případech dal svůj vlastní život - pro průchod legislativy je pro republikány v Kongresu, aby se připojili k demokratům při průchodu zákona o změně hlasovacích práv obnovit slib zákona o hlasovacích právech z roku 1965.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, demokratka, zastupuje Floridský 23. kongresový okrsek v Kongresu Spojených států.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Otázky a odpovědi: Odborník na Vatikánskou ochranu Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. června 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Obrázek: Australští jezuité.<br/><br/>Předseda Centra pro ochranu dětí na Gregoriánské univerzitě v Římě a člen Papežské komise pro ochranu nezletilých, Hans Zollner SJ, byl v roce 2018 v Austrálii, aby promluvil s vedoucími představiteli katolického ministerstva a přeživšími.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh z Jezuitské komunikace se s ním během návštěvy posadil, aby prozkoumal, jak církev reaguje na krizi zneužívání v mezinárodním měřítku a co se můžeme naučit z našich zkušeností v Austrálii.<br/><br/>MM: Toto je vaše třetí cesta do Austrálie. Navštívili jste několik dalších zemí, abyste zjistili, jak církev reaguje na zneužívání po celém světě. Můžete nám dát nějakou představu o tom, jak vypadá globální obraz?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Po tom, co jsem navštívil asi 50 zemí na pěti nebo šesti kontinentech, chápu, že církev se v posledních několika letech skutečně začíná zabývat otázkou spravedlnosti vůči obětem, naslouchání jim a dělání čehokoliv, co může být uděláno v oblasti ochrany.<br/><br/>Koncem dubna jsem byl u jezuitských provinciálů z celé Afriky a prezident Jezuitské asistence Afriky a Madagaskaru je tomuto velmi oddaný. Vypracoval důkladný akční plán pro formování a pro zavedení pokynů všude. Je to velmi ohleduplné a velmi cílevědomé úsilí udělat cokoliv, co může být uděláno, aby bylo proaktivně angažováno jako jezuité v Africe - na kontinentu, kde ještě před několika lety to všechno bylo cizím jazykem.<br/><br/>Jednou z výzev při snaze o rozvoj tohoto globálního přístupu je, že máte co do činění s tolika kulturami a tolika různými chápáními. Jak to dáte dohromady a pokusíte se poskytnout školení a podporu náboženským komunitám, které se těmito otázkami zabývají?<br/><br/>To je jedna z hlavních otázek, které máme. Myslím, že to, co mohu udělat, je stimulovat diskusi, stimulovat reflexi a připravit lidi co nejvíce, aby mohli dělat základy.<br/><br/>Centrum pro ochranu dětí na Gregoriánské univerzitě nepředstírá, že má odpověď na každou otázku. Nejen proto, že neznáme konkrétní souvislosti - možná jich pár známe, ale mluvíme o tisících kultur, mluvíme o stovkách jazyků, mluvíme o velmi různorodých právních základech. To se liší i někdy v rámci jedné země, jako je Austrálie, kde máte státy v rámci společenství Austrálie, které mají jiné zákony než jiné státy.<br/><br/>Jsem někdo, kdo se snaží vyvolat a stimulovat diskusi a reflexi. Jsem také velmi rád, že poslouchám lidi.<br/><br/>Zmínil jste potřebu naslouchat obětem a podporovat je v tom, aby byly vyslyšeny. Očividně jsme měli Královskou komisi tady v Austrálii, ale jaké jsou některé další způsoby, jak jste viděl, že hlasy obětí jsou podporovány po celém světě?<br/><br/>Ve Francii je jedna diecéze, která založila to, co nazývají "Naslouchající prostor". Tam mohou oběti přijít a mohou se vyjádřit. Biskup je přítomen. Je to otevřený prostor, ve kterém jsou lidé, kteří byli nesmírně zraněni, přinejmenším svobodní, aby vyjádřili, co chtějí od vedení církve požadovat atd.<br/><br/>Existují i jiná místa v USA nebo v jiných zemích, kam byly oběti přizvány diecézemi, provinciemi a vedením církve, aby se přihlásily. Musím říci, že celkově si myslím, že existuje dobrá vůle a existuje více lidí, jako jsou biskupové a provinciálové, kteří naslouchají obětem, než si myslíme. Neexistuje však žádný model, který by obětem dával nejen prostor k tomu, aby se vyjadřovaly a byly vyslyšeny, ale také aby se aktivně angažovaly v rozvoji církve.<br/><br/>Pokud jde o zřízení prostor pro podporu obětí, jaké jsou některé z věcí, které jste viděli, které by mohly opravdu pomoci - a že bychom mohli uvažovat zde v Austrálii?<br/><br/>Jedním z hlavních bodů, které mnoho obětí vyvolává, je: "Nemůžeme mít v rámci farních prostředí, v prostředí škol pravidelný rozhovor, který zahrnuje ty, kteří přežili zneužívání jako řádní členové výboru, komise, zvukového výboru, skupiny zpětné vazby nebo něco takového?" Takže tento hlas není přinášen pouze při určité příležitosti, nebo tam, kde se člověk cítí, že je v bodě, kdy o tom může mluvit, ale je pravidelně slyšen - zabudovat tento hlas do systému.<br/><br/>To pomůže nám všem. Pomůže přeživším a obětem, protože se budou cítit vítáni a oceňováni v konkrétních zkušenostech a konkrétních životních výzvách, kterými prošli. Za druhé to pomůže komunitě jako celku, protože se můžeme alespoň více a více zaměřit na to, jaké jsou zájmy a specifické potřeby přeživších, které mohou také mluvit o potřebách mladých lidí.<br/><br/>M: Tady v Austrálii máme silné skupiny přeživších, kteří se během tohoto procesu dokázali navzájem podporovat. Ale říkáte, že potřebujeme nějaký způsob, jak podpořit tyto skupiny a podporovat tyto lidi, a to i prostřednictvím našich vlastních institucí?<br/><br/>A myslím, že musíme být kreativní. Bude to fungovat pro jednu školu a jednu farnost a jednu diecézi jedním způsobem a pro ostatní jiným způsobem. Protože ti, kteří přežili, s nimiž jsem v neustálém kontaktu, mají velmi podobné požadavky a podobné zkušenosti, pokud jde o přijetí v církvi nebo ne - cítí se vyhozeni nebo zamítnuti. Dozvěděl jsem se, že musíte být také velmi vstřícní v přijímání rozdílů v tom, co tato konkrétní skupina, nebo tento konkrétní přeživší, chce, žádá a potřebuje.<br/><br/>M: Přeživší mluví o tom, že chtějí, aby jejich příběhy byly vyslyšeny a uznány. Máme Královskou komisi zde v Austrálii, která poskytla nezávislý proces, kde by se oběti mohly přihlásit. Je něco takového zapotřebí, pokud jde o pravdu, spravedlnost a proces usmíření pro církev na mezinárodní úrovni?<br/><br/>H: Ano, myslím, že je to potřeba na mezinárodní úrovni. Ale myslím si, že nejprve si každá místní církev musí udělat vlastní domácí úkoly. Nevidím, že by se velmi brzy stalo, že by byl ustanoven nějaký takový koncil nebo komise, která by se touto oblastí zabývala pro celou Církev. Církev má 1,3 miliardy členů a je přítomna ve 190 zemích se všemi druhy rozdílů v očekáváních týkajících se psychologické, duchovní a finanční podpory.<br/><br/>Je tu jedna věc, se kterou jsem se v komunikaci, práci a naslouchání obětem setkal, a to, že chtějí být vyslyšeni. Pokud by tedy existoval pocit, že oběti jsou neustále vyslyšeny – v Římě i jinde – myslím, že by to přineslo velkou úlevu mnoha obětem.<br/><br/>Myslím si, že znepokojení, zejména pokud jde o vaši otázku, spočívá v tom, že místní církve dělají vše, co je v jejich silách, aby oběti byly v této konkrétní zemi vyslyšeny. Mám seznam lidí, kteří chtějí mluvit přímo se Svatým otcem, a fyzicky je to nemožné. Byl jsem tam v roce 2014, abych přeložil pro dva německé přeživší, kteří byli vybráni se dvěma irskými a dvěma anglickými přeživšími, když dostal šest z nich doma. Celé ráno je poslouchal jeden po druhém. Pro každého z nich tam byl 40 až 45 minut, a kdyby to udělal pro každého, kdo přežil, už by nemohl spát.<br/><br/>Jeho příkladem je modelování pro celou katolickou církev způsobem, jakým jsou oběti a přeživší přijímány, přijímány a poslouchány. Myslím si, že kdyby biskupové a provinciálové v tomto světě, ve všech zemích, následovali jeho příkladu, mnoho přeživších by to opravdu ocenilo.<br/><br/>Arcibiskup Diarmud Martin byl nedávno citován těsně před Světovým setkáním rodin, o Papežské komisi, když řekl, že je příliš malá, protože je v současné době nastavena tak, aby dosáhla toho, co potřebuje k dosažení. Musí církev dávat více prostředků do toho, jak dohlíží na tyto otázky?<br/><br/>V současné době máme 16 členů z prakticky všech kontinentů a hlavních jazykových skupin. Zastupujeme různé disciplíny a profese a účelem komise – jako právě vyhlášených zákonů – je poskytnout radu Svatému otci.<br/><br/>Běžným nedorozuměním ohledně komise je, že se nejprve zabýváme případy obvinění. Nemáme žádnou právní nebo správní pravomoc, pokud jde o případy, protože pokud jde o obvinění ze zneužívání, tribunály a postupy jsou stanoveny.<br/><br/>Druhým nedorozuměním je, že přímo podporujeme věci v terénu. Naším prvním a nejdůležitějším cílem je, abychom radili Svatému otci v otázkách.<br/><br/>Takže z mého pohledu ano, musíme investovat více. Musíme však více investovat na místní úrovni a musíme zajistit, aby návrhy Papežské komise byly předány Svatému otci – což obvykle dělá prezident – a pak následuje proces, který odráží to, co jsme dali jako naši radu.<br/><br/>V Austrálii Catholic Professional Standards Limited dohlíží na reakci církve a poskytuje pokyny a podporu pro zajištění toho, aby všechny instituce v církvi byly institucemi bezpečnými pro děti. Je zapotřebí nějaké organizační podpory ze strany Říma pro ty biskupy a diecéze, které se snaží vytvořit tyto instituce a zajistit ochranu v těchto diecézích?<br/><br/>Myslím si, že Komise se v tomto směru nakonec rozvine. Nyní jsou v procesu najímání odborníků v těchto oblastech.<br/><br/>Myslím, že církev musí pochopit, že místní církve se mohou učit jeden od druhého. A moje porozumění bylo vždy - a myslím, že nám to Svatý otec připomněl -, že církev nebude fungovat jako centralizovaná společnost. Nefunguje to efektivně. Každý biskup, každá biskupská konference, má do jisté míry svůj život sám o sobě. To, co se potřebujeme naučit, je otevřít kanály vzájemné komunikace.<br/><br/>Existuje řada věcí, které lidé obviňují za zneužívání v církvi. Jako kněz a psycholog, a jako někdo, kdo se setkal a pracoval s přeživšími, jaké jsou vaše myšlenky na toto téma?<br/><br/>Myslím, že otázka, odkud zneužívání pochází, je nejdůležitější, a papež ji adresoval ve svém dopise Božímu lidu, který byl zveřejněn 20. srpna. Říká v prvním odstavci a opakuje to znovu a znovu, že otázka sexuálního zneužívání je vždy spojena - nebo téměř vždy spojena - nejen s otázkou zneužívání moci, ale také se zneužíváním svědomí.<br/><br/>Skutečná základní otázka zneužívání je tedy mnohem složitější než jen otázka sexuality – ať už heterosexuální nebo homosexuální. Je to otázka moci a tam musíme skutečně pracovat na otázce, jak chápeme kněžství, jak chápeme biskupství, jak chápeme a žijeme naše služby? Jaké jsou hranice?<br/><br/>Proto jsem velmi rád, že jezuitská provincie v Austrálii zavádí kodex chování, protože nemluvíme jen o sexuálním zneužívání nezletilých. Mluvíme o sexuálním zneužívání dospělých a mluvíme o zneužívání jinými způsoby - jako je zneužívání svědomí, kde někomu diktujete, co si myslíte, nebo předstíráte, že víte od Boha, a můžete říct jiné osobě: "Musíte to udělat", proti svědomí této osoby.<br/><br/>Mnoho lidí si myslí, že celibát způsobuje zneužívání. Jak vždy říkám, celibát jako takový není důvodem ke zneužívání – jak jinak vysvětlíme, že 99,9 % všech násilníků nežije v celibátu, a jak vysvětlíme, že 95 nebo 96 % všech kněží nezneužívá nezletilé? Ale celibát nebo slib čistoty, který není ve skutečnosti integrován, který není ve skutečnosti řádně prožíván – ano, to vytváří problém. Někdy lidé pijí, někdy hazardují a někdy se dopouštějí sexuálního pochybení s dospělými i nezletilými.<br/><br/>Skutečnou otázkou je, jak se vypořádáme s pojmem náboženské duchovní moci, do níž jsou kněží a biskupové vtaženi? Jak nám může teologie pomoci pochopit, a možná, jak nám může sociologie, psychologie nebo obchodní administrativa pomoci definovat hranice moci a nutnost udržet vaše hranice? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Ve skutečnosti bych dokonce zašel tak daleko, že bych řekl, že to není něco, co se nikdy nezmění, ani bychom se neměli nechat rozrušit tím, že to změníme. Za 10 let budeme mít stále krvácející okraj, složité položky v seznamu největších obav a věci, které se konečně dostáváme k pochopení, budou hlavními částmi našich výdajů.<br/><br/>Nyní mají Gunnar a Andy vynikající body, zejména pokud jde o IT týmy, které vidí IT problémy a řeší je pomocí IT řešení; ve skutečnosti jsem přesvědčen, že jejich body mají zásluhu.<br/><br/>Ale myslím, že existují i jiné nápady, které trumf ty (já jsem komentoval na jejich blogy o tom, a později se rozhodl, že bych měl jen blog zde). Tyto top 3 obavy jsou krvácející nové takové, že:<br/><br/>Bojíme se nových věcí, protože jim nerozumíme, nebo jim nerozumíme, protože jsou nové.<br/><br/>Jsou pro nás příliš nové na to, abychom k nim měli solidní přístup.<br/><br/>Jsou pro nás příliš nové, abychom věděli, zda bychom se měli obávat nebo ne! máme tendenci se paranoidně / obávat, což je dobré!<br/><br/>příliš nové, aby jim byly přiděleny zřejmé rozpočtové položky. Mohu si koupit krabici nebo nějaký software, který poskytuje "bezpečnost cloudu" nebo "bezpečnost sociálních médií"?<br/><br/>Jsou tak nové, že firma ani neví, jak je používat nebo co od nich chce. Nemluvě o tom, jak je můžeme zajistit, když se stále setkáme nebo alespoň ne dupat po všech obchodních potřebách. Pokud firma ještě neví, jak je používat, nejsem si jistý, že bezpečnost je v jakékoli pozici, aby bezpečně vedla toto použití.<br/><br/>Je také třeba zmínit, že tyto nové věci jsou do značné míry tlačeny přes spotřebitelskou zemi a do podnikání, s IT jako "Oh yeah", myslel. Firewally, AV, AM, Auth jsou všechny IT odpovědi na typicky IT problémy. Jsou to také velmi subjektivní problémy, na rozdíl od velmi objektivních položek, jako jsou firewally, známé škodlivé bity, chování, podpisy, porty. Podnikání představuje velmi složité problémy, které se často týkají lidí (které nemůžeme opravit) a které často nezapadají do pravidel přikrývky. I když jsme se odvrátili od technických řešení a věnovali svůj čas řešení těchto problémů, stále nebudou úhledně vyřešeny. Stejně tak, když přijde na shove, můžete mít a splnit cíle s firewally? Můžete ukázat zlepšení? To vše vyplývá z poněkud subjektivního netechnického aspektu těchto otázek. Rozdíl mezi vysvědčením dítěte a zpětnou vazbou, kterou získáte z konference rodičů a učitelů. Pokud máte dítě, s kterým z nich byste byli nejvíce nakloněni nesouhlasit nebo ne nutně věřit? (Odpověď je subjektivní!)<br/><br/>Dalo by se říci, že je to přirozený pokrok v oblasti bezpečnosti a technologie: od podpory technických kontrol až po posun směrem k chování a lidem. Jistě, tyto 3 hlavní obavy lze říci, že prorazit firewally a síťové segmenty, ale to je povaha těchto věcí (sociální média "propíchnutí" přes firewall je daleko odlišná od mě děrování přes SSH připojení k překlenutí mé domácí sítě; sociální média jsou podobná * způsobem * používám SSH připojení poté, co je již proraženo, protože je potřeba; tj. sociální média je způsob, jakým se používá port 80).<br/><br/>V podstatě všechny indikace ukazují na to, že nejsou překvapeni touto dichotomií. A nemyslím si, že je to nějaký další náznak toho, že IT / zabezpečení to dělá špatně, nebo není správně sladěno s podnikáním, nebo má technické temné pozadí serverové místnosti. Neříkám, že děláme věci správně nebo jsme správně sladěni, ale výše uvedené není dobrým argumentem pro podporu teorie těchto nedostatků.<br/><br/>Nyní pro opravdu velký skok. Chtěl bych přirovnat současný nárůst v oblasti mobilních počítačů, aby byl stejně velký jako zavedení počítačů do podnikání a později PC / internetu do podnikání. Nebyl jsem nablízku, když se to stalo, ani jsem nebyl v průmyslu, když se revoluce osobních počítačů dostala do podnikání, ale vsadím se, že to je zatím nejbližší srovnání. Jsou to zatraceně nové a jsou to velké změny, než jen přinášet Macy nebo nový software nebo nějaký nový obchodní proces. |
