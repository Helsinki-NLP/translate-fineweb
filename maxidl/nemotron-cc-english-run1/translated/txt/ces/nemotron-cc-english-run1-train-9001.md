| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Například článek VI, odstavec 2 americké ústavy obsahuje ustanovení, že "všechny smlouvy ... budou nejvyšším zákonem země." I když je zřejmé, že smlouvy samy o sobě nemají stejný účinek jako federální zákony. Ve skutečnosti se stanou funkčními až poté, co tato ustanovení vstoupí v platnost jako federální zákon se souhlasem Senátu a prezidenta. I když se jedná o praxi, je obecně přijímanou zásadou v mezinárodním právu, že některé smlouvy mají pro země závazný účinek. Smlouva musí splňovat požadavek, aby byla samovykonávací smlouvou, která by měla vliv na zemi bez jakéhokoli odpovídajícího vnitrostátního zákonodárného sboru přímo.<br/><br/>To vyvolává otázku, která smlouva bude kvalifikována jako "samovykonávající" a která ne?<br/><br/>O tom, zda se jedná o samovykonávající smlouvu či nikoli, rozhodují vnitrostátní soudci případ od případu (Buergenthal, 1992). Abychom tomu porozuměli, podíváme se nejprve na dva typy teorií, které následují země o povaze smluv, které se vztahují na domácí právo. Tyto dvě teorie jsou monismus a dualismus. V podstatě vidí rámec domácího a mezinárodního práva jako jedinou hierarchii a dvě samostatné hierarchie, resp. (Wildhaber, 1971). Země po monismu věří, že některé smlouvy jsou okamžitě závazné a okamžitě mají vliv na zemi. Jakmile byla smlouva ratifikována, může být uplatněna u vnitrostátních soudů a je považována za součást práva země. Země po dualismu věří, že smlouva neovlivňuje domácí právo, dokud nebyla posílena zákonodárným sborem přijatým v parlamentu. Příkladem dualismu je to, jak se Evropská úmluva o lidských právech stala funkční ve Spojeném království po schválení zákona o lidských právech z roku 1998 v jejich parlamentu (zákony, 2000).<br/><br/>Mezinárodní právo je různé, a tak jsou druhy postupů různých zemí následovat pro přijetí smluv. Některé ústavy samy o sobě zmiňují postupy pro ratifikaci smlouvy. Některé země mají dokonce odlišné zacházení s mezinárodním smluvním právem a mezinárodním zvykovým právem. Některé mezinárodní organizace, jako je Evropská unie, často ovlivňují vnitrostátní právo svých členských států. Členské státy Evropské unie musí uvést v účinnost určité formy komunitárního zákonodárství, i když má zásadní rozdíl od samovykonávacích smluv. Rozdíl je v tom, že není na soudcích jednotlivých států, aby rozhodovali, zda jsou ustanovení samočinná, nebo ne, ale spíše na Evropském soudním dvoru, aby je vykládal podle svých zakládacích smluv. Jiné formy mezinárodního práva vytvořené prostřednictvím rezolucí nebo podobně nemusí mít pro tyto státy stejný účinek. Nicméně, oni by je mohli považovat za formy "měkkého práva" a podívat se na ně interpretovat záměr zákona. Někdy se prohlášení učiněná soudními orgány mezinárodních organizací, jako je Meziamerický soud pro lidská práva, dotýkají jejich členských států. Ačkoli tato prohlášení nejsou pro členské státy závazná, zdá se, že vnitrostátní soudci se odvolávají na jejich autoritativní výklad.<br/><br/>Proto je třeba při analýze postupů a precedentů stanovených v různých zemích zaujmout individuální přístup. Chcete-li prozkoumat koncept samovykonávacích smluv, bude tento dokument porovnávat precedenty stanovené různými jurisdikcemi. Pokud si čtenář přeje provést podobnou analýzu, může tak učinit tím, že se podívá na různé národní ročenky o mezinárodním právu. Tyto ročenky budou mít většinou část věnovanou vztahu mezi mezinárodním a vnitrostátním právem.<br/><br/>Mezinárodní jurisprudence:<br/><br/>Nejvýznamnější otázkou, která přichází pro vnitrostátní soudy, je, zda je smlouva samovykonávána? Pokud lze smlouvu použít, aniž by byl přijat další vnitrostátní zákonodárce, který by ji posílil. Tato otázka se objevila ve věci Czeslaw S v. Státní pokladna a ministr státní pokladny, kde polský Ústavní soud rozhodl, že vzhledem k tomu, že ustanovení smlouvy odkazují na vnitrostátní opatření, která mají být přijata, smlouva není samočinně prováděna (nároky Bug River, Czeslaw S v. Státní pokladna a ministr státní pokladny, 2003). Pokud smlouva odkazuje na vnitrostátní opatření, která mají být přijata, sama o sobě nevytváří nové povinnosti. Místo toho posiluje záměr smlouvy, aby vnitrostátní právní proces přijal stejná opatření. Podobná otázka byla vznesena v případě Sosa ve Spojených státech amerických. V tomto případě soud zvažoval, zda Mezinárodní pakt o občanských a politických právech byl samovykonávací smlouva. Americký nejvyšší soud také prohlásil, že Mezinárodní pakt o občanských a politických právech není samovykonávající smlouvou (Soud, 2004). Spolkový nejvyšší soud Švýcarska také zkoumal samovykonávající povahu Mezinárodního paktu o občanských a politických právech. Otázka před soudem zněla, zda čl. 13 odst. 2 písm. b) a c) mají samovykonávající povahu. Soud zkoumal, zda smlouva byla částečně samovykonává a to tím, že kontroluje, zda existuje minimální základní obsah smlouvy, aby mohly být použitelné. Soud rozhodl, že žádné takové ustanovení ve Smlouvě neshledal (A a B proti vládě kantonu Curych, 2000).<br/><br/>Je důležité pochopit, že tyto otázky se liší od základní otázky, zda mezinárodní právo může být použito jako součást práva země? Aby bylo možné odpovědět na tuto otázku, bude dokument posuzovat rozsudek Nejvyššího soudu Dominikánské republiky. Nejvyšší soud uvedl, že článek 3 ústavy Dominikánské republiky učinil mezinárodní právo závazným pro domácí právní řád. Soud zamítl výklad vrchního zemského soudu, že tyto smlouvy byly "cizí zákonodárnou mocí" a nebyly součástí vnitrostátního právního řádu. Nejvyšší soud stanovil, že všechny smlouvy ratifikované Dominikánskou republikou tvoří součást dominikánského práva, a proto mohou být označovány jako samovykonávající (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción a ors, 1997). Spolkový nejvyšší soud ve Švýcarsku zkoumal, zda byla Libsonova smlouva samoúčelná a přímo použitelná pro švýcarské univerzity. Podle příslušné judikatury je norma smlouvy přímo použitelná, pokud je její obsah dostatečně přesný a jasný, aby tvořil základ rozhodnutí v konkrétním případě. Norma tedy musí být ospravedlnitelná, tj. definovat práva a povinnosti jednotlivce a směřovat k příslušným orgánům“ (X vs University of Lucerne, 2014). To znamená, že to, zda je smlouva přímo použitelná nebo ne, závisí na tom, zda je norma oprávněná. Lisabonská smlouva je založena na zásadě kvalifikace získané na palubě. To je sděleno prostřednictvím čl. IV odst. 1 smlouvy. Účelem bylo vytvořit pro státy povinnost prokázat, že jejich rozhodovací proces je spravedlivý, transparentní a nediskriminační. Odpovědnost za prokázání, že žadatel nesplňuje požadovaná kritéria, nese subjekt provádějící posouzení. Smlouva zaručuje procesní záruky, které jsou obecně přijímány zeměmi, a proto soud považoval tuto smlouvu za samočinnou. To dále ukazuje různé výklady soudů různých zemí.<br/><br/>Je nezbytné sledovat, zda jsou normy stanovené smlouvami skutečně dodržovány. Judikatury různých jurisdikcí zdůraznily, že vnitrostátní soudy jsou konečným orgánem v otázce, zda je smlouva samočinná. K dodržování a řádnému plnění smluv patří také povinnost, kterou mají země, jak je zakotveno v článku 26 Vídeňské úmluvy o smluvním právu (VCLT). Článek 27 jej dále posiluje tím, že stanoví, že závazky mezinárodního práva nelze ignorovat použitím vnitrostátního práva jako ospravedlnění. Soudy mnoha zemí to používají jako zdroj výkladu, jako je lotyšský Ústavní soud. V případě vnitrostátní normy, která je v rozporu s mezinárodní normou, soud rozhodl, že vnitrostátní norma je neplatná. K dosažení svého závěru se Soudní dvůr silně opíral o nezbytné plnění smluv v dobré víře, jak je uvedeno v článku 26 VCLT (Linija v. Lotyšsko, 2004).<br/><br/>Závěr:<br/><br/>Z výše uvedeného je zřejmé, že smlouvy mají zvláštní požadavky předtím, než mohou být považovány za samovykonávající. Nicméně, pokud všechny tyto stranou, nejdůležitější stále zůstává výklad vnitrostátních soudů. Vnitrostátní soudy rozhodují o tom, zda lze smlouvu označit za samočinnou či nikoli. Ačkoli jejich ústava může obsahovat ustanovení o smluvním právu jako nejvyšším právu země, soudy z různých zemí interpretují tato ustanovení různými způsoby. To může být viděno, jak americká a dominikánská ústava oba obsahují tato ustanovení, ale následovat zcela odlišné interpretace stejného. Pojem "samovykonávání" nemusí být pro tyto smlouvy shodný, protože v praxi stále potřebují schválení od vnitrostátních soudů. V ideálním případě by mělo být cestou vpřed to, aby země uznaly samovykonávající povahu smluv a zacházely s nimi způsobem, v němž jsou respektovány články 26 a 27 Smlouvy o ES. Opět se jedná o "ideální" situaci a není pravděpodobné, že by se v dohledné době dostala do státní praxe určitých jurisdikcí. Naděje však může být získána tím, že se podíváme na výklady vnitrostátních soudů, které tyto normy respektují a doufejme, že vydláždí cestu k tomu, aby to ostatní soudy uznaly.<br/><br/>Reference:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Zákulisní tragédie, které ovlivnily obsazení nejsmrtelnějšího úlovku v televizi<br/><br/>Snížené rybolovné kvóty<br/><br/>I když posádka v nejsmrtelnějším úlovku vydělává většinu svých peněz z Discovery, neznamená to, že ve skutečnosti neprodávají svůj úlovek. Dalo by se říct, že mají dva zdroje příjmů, což je něco, co většina lidí ve své práci nemá.<br/><br/>V roce 2017 však Aljašské ministerstvo ryb a zvěře zahájilo systém kvót, který omezil množství ryb, které by jakýkoli rybářský člun mohl přivést zpět na břeh o polovinu. To znamená, že posádka nejnebezpečnějšího úlovku zažila za několik let obrovský pokles zisků. |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGY<br/><br/>Podívejte se na naši sbírku blogů napsaných kolegy.<br/><br/>INFORMAČNÍ BLOGY<br/><br/>Nestresujte se tím<br/><br/>podle<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>Zář 12, 2019<br/><br/>Stres, bez ohledu na to, jak velké věci se děje, může vždy najít způsob, jak zvýšit svou ošklivou hlavu. Ať už je to žádost o práci na poslední chvíli nebo papír, který jste zapomněli napsat a je třeba druhý den, stres může vždy najít cestu do svého dne, pokud to dovolíte. Dnes vám ukážu několik věcí, které můžete udělat pro odstranění nebo prevenci stresu.<br/><br/>První věc, kterou můžete udělat, je cvičení. Cvičení je skvělý způsob, jak zmírnit stres, protože snižuje stresový hormon ve vašem těle známý jako kortizol. Nižší hladiny kortizolu ve vašem těle, tím nižší bude úroveň stresu. Cvičení může také zvýšit vaši důvěru, a když vaše důvěra je nahoru pak váš stres je obvykle dolů. Pro mě, když jsem ve stresu, vždy cvičím tím, že jdu do posilovny a cvičím box, pomáhá mi spálit kalorie a snížit stres a zároveň se bavit.<br/><br/>Psaní věcí dolů byl způsob, jak uklidnit lidi na velmi dlouhou dobu, a to je další téma na našem seznamu. Psaní to, co je, aby vás zdůraznil, je způsob, jak vyčistit mysl, a to pomáhá zbavit se stresu stejně. Podobnou zkušenost mám i při psaní příběhů, obvykle když kvůli starému nápadu nedokážu vymyslet nový, napíšu starý nápad a zamyslím se nad ním. Tehdy se začnou objevovat nové nápady a můžu pokračovat v psaní normálně. Je to stejné se stresem. Přemýšlejte o proudu, který pokračuje po své cestě, dokud nenarazí na bobrovou přehradu, a že přehrada blokuje tok vody a vše se začne stavět. Jediný způsob, jak dostat průtok vody zpět do normálu, je odstranit přehradu. To je místo, kde psaní přichází. Když si to zapíšete, odstraňujete stres kousek po kousku, dokud nebudete moci znovu normálně přemýšlet.<br/><br/>Stres může přijít do našich životů prostřednictvím dveří v našem životě, které máme otevřené. Prokrastinace je způsob, jak můžeme nechat otevřené dveře pro stres. Čekání na zítřek může být pro dnešek zábavné, ale zítra vás to bude bolet a je to velmi krátkozraké řešení. Čím déle budete čekat, abyste něco udělali, tím větší se něco stane, a čím větší se stane, tím více stresu budete pozvat do svého života. Péče o něco, jakmile ji obdržíme, je skvělý způsob, jak zabránit stresu, ale je to něco, co vyžaduje velkou disciplínu. Čím více ze svého života vystřihnete prokrastinaci, tím více budete bez stresu. Takže zavři ty dveře a vypustíš všechen ten studený vzduch.<br/><br/>Takže pojďme zkontrolovat: Cvičení, Zapište si, co vás stresuje, a neprokrastinujte. To je jen několik způsobů, jak zmírnit stres, ale pro mě jsou nejúčinnější. I když vím, že to nemusí fungovat pro každého, rád bych pozval každého, kdo se cítí vystresovaný, aby zjistil, jak se ho zbavit. |
