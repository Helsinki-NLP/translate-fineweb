| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | I když uznáváte, že je nemožné někoho argumentovat, aby miloval něco, co nenávidí, a naopak, je to stále často příjemné pokusit se o argument. Když mluvíme s lidmi, jejichž názory jsou v přímém rozporu s našimi, jsme nuceni bránit svůj vkus, definovat své názory a analyzovat, proč reagujeme tak, jak reagujeme. Proto máme Why Don't You Like This?, ve kterém se dva z našich zaměstnanců pokusí zjistit, zda se lidé s opačnými názory mohou dostat za "Ne, mýlíte se!" a mít občanskou, konstruktivní a možná i přesvědčivou diskusi o jejich sporných bodech. Protože bez ohledu na to, co rádio říká, stále existuje střední cesta mezi "Naprosto souhlasíme" a "Mám pravdu, a ty jsi hloupý a zlý."<br/><br/>Scott: Od té doby, co jsme diskutovali o mém Scott Pilgrim Vs. Odpadlictví od světa, jsme hledali případ, kde bych vám mohl zavolat, že se vám nelíbí něco úžasného, a nemuseli jsme hledat dlouho. Seděli jsme hned vedle sebe v Hugome Martina Scorsese, naprosto okouzleni jeho fantastickou poctou divům raného němého kina, a vy, jak se zdá, jste mu na každém kroku odporovali. Kritický konsensus byl na mé straně: Dosáhl 9. místa v naší kolektivní Top 15 (ačkoli jste to uvedli jako svou Přeceňovanou volbu), získal (nebo umístil) v různých filmových kritikách a v současné době se těší 83 skóre na Metacritic. To samozřejmě neznamená, že se mýlíte, ale je na vás, abyste vysvětlili, proč byl Hugo, podle vašich slov, "dutý a umělý", kde mnozí z nás to viděli jako krásnou evokaci Scorseseho dětství a média, když bylo ještě v plenkách. A prosím, buďte jemní, když roztrháte tohoto motýla za křídla.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Tasha: Nemůžu být jemná, Scotte. Někdy to bolí míň, když si strhneš náplast najednou. (A i když ne, kdo chce chodit v poloroztrhané náplasti? Hnus.) Faktem je, že jsem zjistil, že Hugo byl únavně manipulativní cvičení v padělání, počínaje jeho otevřením klouzat přes pařížské vlakové nádraží, což mi připomnělo víc než cokoliv jiného Robert Zemeckis 'Polar Express. Na rozdíl od Mike D'Angelo, jsem fanouškem dlouhého, neporušeného bere jako způsob, jak vytvořit prostor a povzbudit diváky, aby nevědomky zadrželi dech, když kamera zkoumá oblast; ale když prostor, který je zkoumán, je úhledná, lesklá tvorba CGI a kamera plave beztížně přes něj bez fyzického smyslu, že buď kamera nebo okolí jsou opravdu tam, že průzkum začne cítit jako sledování někoho jiného hrát videohru. A zbytek filmu mi připadal podobně pórovitý a neskutečný, a to jak z hlediska jeho nastavení, tak z hlediska jeho vysoce vymyšleného, sentimentálního příběhu.<br/><br/>Nemám nutně problém s uměle vytvořeným, stylizovaným prostředím ve filmu. Miloval jsem Baz Luhrmannův stejně rozlehlý, naprosto umělý pohled na Paříž například v Moulin Rouge, ale ten film má smysl pro svou vlastní směšnost, smysl pro humor o tom, jak je to záměrně over-the-top. Ditto stylizace Jean-Pierre Jeunet, zejména v Amélie. (Oba Jeunet a Luhrmann cítil jako silné vizuální vlivy zde.) Mám však pocit, že Martin Scorsese chtěl, abych brát Huga zcela vážně. I když je to další bolestně sentimentální příběh o odvážném sirotkovi, který vrací barvu do života nevrlého starce a já prostě nemohl.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Není nic, co by mě bavilo víc, než být překvapený. A není nic, co bych nenáviděl a odolával víc, než být otevřeně manipulován, být hlasitě řečeno, co cítit a kdy to cítit. Dobrý film dělá takové věci jemně; špatný používá padající hudební narážky a sladké struny - a v tomto případě, špinavý, obrovský oči, rozcuchaný sirotek zírající žalostně na kameru - požadovat patos a říct divákům, že jsou to hrozní lidé, pokud to neservírují na požádání. To znamená, že se mohu vypořádat se smutnými dětmi a nevrlými dospělými, kteří si navzájem zlepšují život - opravdu jsem vykopal letošní Le Havre, což bylo v podstatě stejné spiknutí bez veškeré roztomilosti - ale zjistil jsem, že umělé prostředí špatně odráží umělé emoce a každý z nich se zdá být falešnější.<br/><br/>Začněme s tím. V našem přehlíženém videu jste s Noelem vzali Keitha za úkol prosadit Tyrannosaura, protože jste cítili, že to není dostatečně realistické - příliš vymyšlené, příliš miserablistické, příliš mnoho, příliš daleko. Jak je možné, že si nemůžete koupit zastaralého cvoka, který rozbíjí věci, když je naštvaný, ale můžete si koupit sirotka, který žije uvnitř obřích vlakových hodin a vydává se na rozmarnou cestu k opravě tajemného automatu, o kterém věří, že by mohl mít tajemství od svého mrtvého otce, ale který ho místo toho vede na podivnou cestu sebeobjevování, do kouzelné země kina? Nenašli jste nikdy Hugův křiklavý rokokový design, agresivní srdceryvné škubání, nebo trakařské návaly vtípků, byť trochu přehnané nebo těžko polykatelné?<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet a Luhrmann jako vlivy na Scorsese?! Zapomeňte na to, že jste neslušní, teď mě záměrně šťoucháte ostrým klackem. Pokud hledáte inspiraci pro Huga - opravdu, pokud hledáte emocionální jádro Huga - musíte se vrátit do Scorseseho dětství na Elizabeth Street v Malé Itálii, kde se malý astmatický chlapec, který si nemůže hrát venku s ostatními dětmi, uchýlil k fantaziím Alexandra Kordy jako zloděj Bagdad. Nebo jednodušeji, jděte přímo ke zdroji: George Méliés, jehož Výlet na Měsíc zůstává Velkým třeskem všech filmových fantazií, ten okamžik, kdy kamera nebyla použita k dokumentaci světa, jaký je, ale jakékoliv rozmarné, magické, dopravní místo, které pro něj filmař chce vymyslet. A tato tradice byla rozvíjena a rozšiřována po celá desetiletí předtím, než se na ni objevily špinavé malé tlapky Jeunet a Luhrmann.<br/><br/>A když už mluvíme o Jeunetovi, pěkný pokus sebrat mi rétorickou zbraň, ale stejně to řeknu: Jak můžete milovat Amélii, a přesto najít Huga syntetického a "nadměrně" a "únavně manipulativního"? Říkáte, že Amélie a Moulin Rouge mají vykoupení "smyslu pro [jejich] vlastní směšnost", kde Scorsese znamená, abychom brali Huga vážně, a nemyslím si, že je to tak, alespoň v tom druhém bodě. To, že Scorsese cítí zřejmou vášeň pro filmy, je, předpokládám, důvod, proč byste Huga interpretovali jako sebevědomého, ale pro mě jsou to ty pocity, které dávají filmu emocionální zátěž, kterou filmy Luhrmanna a Jeuneta nemají. Všechny tři filmy agresivně využívají zázraky CGI - a Scorsese přidává 3D do mixu, s nádherným efektem - ale v čem se lišíme, je otázka beztíže. Souhlasím s tím, že CGI má distanční účinek; světy složené výhradně z digitálního plastelínu jsou flexibilní do té míry, že někdy nemají žádnou přítomnost. Huga jste ve svém příspěvku "Přeceňovaný" pro náš Best Of Film označili jako "CGI gimcrack" - perfektní dis... pro další film.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Je fér říct, že Scorsese postavila Huga kolem standardního dětského knižního / filmového spiknutí: Orphanovi chybí jeho táta, vytváří svůj vlastní malý fantasy svět, glomuje na nového přítele, přesvědčuje křupavé staré fuddy-duddy, aby ho změkčil a možná ho adoptoval. Ale to je jen narativní kostra a Scorsese poskytuje spoustu masa a krve. Za prvé, nemůžete sledovat osamělého chlapce Huga, jak se dívá z hodinových věží na rušné pařížské vlakové nádraží, aniž byste mysleli na Scorseseho, dalšího osamělého chlapce, který se dívá z okna své ložnice na Elizabeth Street. A i když nejste dost velký filmový nerd, aby to spojení, opravdu mám pocit, že Hugova cesta není v hledání nové otcovské postavy, ale v vytrvalosti s mechanickou magií, která stojí za odkazem jeho vlastního otce. To je film: Trvalá vize, která nám umožňuje přijmout iluzorní verzi světa rychlostí 24 snímků za sekundu, je věda a magie najednou. Hugův vztah s Méliésem není o tom, že by se stýkal s novým tátou, ale o společném nadšení, které starý muž ponořil do hořkosti.<br/><br/>Zdá se, že i hrstka kritiků filmu je ochotna připustit, že sekvence evokující historii kinematografie a Méliho studio - s Michaelem Stuhlbargem jako hrdinným filmovým učencem! - byly úžasné. Připadalo mi to, v nejlepším možném smyslu, jako opojná komprese mé třídy History Of Film 101 na vysoké škole, kondenzující semestrální cenu klipů a kontextu do něčeho mezi montáží a animovaným pop-up knihou. A to mluví o důmyslném designu filmu, který posouvá skutečnost a fantazii tak krásně, že je to najednou historie Mélies a zrodu filmu, a právě ten druh jednoduchého, přepychově produkovaného filmového zázraku, který by Scorsese sám miloval jako dítě. Díky bohu, že Hugo nenásleduje model Jeunet/Luhrmann a má "pocit vlastní směšnosti". Jako fantazijní znalec byste neřekl, že má cenu hrát to přímo a vážně a nestydatě, než mrkat na publikum? Možná vám Hugo připadá nechutně sladký, ale nemyslím si, že autenticita jeho sentimentu je popírána.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Tasha: Ano, ve skutečnosti jsem našel části Huga okouzlující. (Všimněte si, jak odpovídám na vaši otázku předem, zatímco jste byli příliš zaneprázdněni pěněním s apoplexií, než abyste oslovili moji, i když předpokládám, že to je odpověď sama o sobě. Dobře, "vliv" může přehánět případ - jen jsem myslel, že vizuální styl vypadal velmi povědomě. Ačkoli, jak Keith zdůraznil, když jste to vytáhli osobně, Scorsese není ani proti tomu, aby čerpal inspiraci z vizuálů jiných lidí, ani proti tomu.) Především mě okouzlily části, které se zabývají jeho příběhem, jeho láskou k filmu, prací, kterou vložil do svého umění, a radostí, kterou z něj získal. Je tu strašná spousta krásy a zábavy v inscenaci podvodní scény z Méliesovy "Pohádky" a v sekvenci na konci, zaměřené na Méliho záběry. Uznávám, že Hugovo spojení s Mélies kvůli společné lásce k filmu je hezké a já si užívám dobrý film o natáčení.<br/><br/>Ale Hugo není primárně o filmu, navzdory Méliho kravatám. Kromě témat, která citujete, je to také o hledání svého účelu, jak postavy výslovně, pracně vysvětlují sobě navzájem a nám. A je to o podívanou a velkých akčních kulisách a honičkách a šťastných koncích, kde dokonce i rozzlobený tyran a plachý starší pár a fergawdsakes dokonce i rozmrzelý jezevčík se nakonec spojí s okouzlujícími milostnými zájmy. Je to o super-vyspělé Hermioně Grangerové, která je panovačná a energická a chytrá a chválí magické světy uzavřené v knihách.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Ano, Scorsese si hraje s archetypy. Problém je, že jsem nikdy neměl pocit, že je prodchnul něčím novým, čerstvým nebo uvěřitelným, navzdory jeho vlastnímu příběhu. Dal bych přednost příběhu o mladém Scorsese, který vyrůstal s astmatem - něco malého a skutečného, bez obrovských místností plných hodinových ručiček CGI a zlatých zářících prachových motivů a prorockých snů a zuřící dospělé tyranské stráže se zlatým srdcem - to vše přerostlé, přehnané nesmysly. Stále citujete Scorseseho osobní pozadí a lásku k filmu jako důkaz, že opravdu cítí to, co dává na obrazovku, ale já necítím jeho osobní dotek v ničem z toho, kromě momentů, které jsou výslovně o filmu. Jádro emocí může být skutečné, ale to neznamená, že je poprava méně falešná.<br/><br/>Říkáte, že autenticita emocí se nedá popřít. Neptám se, jestli se Scorsese osobně cítil osamělý a izolovaný jako dítě, ale necítím osamělost a izolaci na obrazovce - vidím spoustu přehnaných signifierů (Hugo je špinavý a jeho oblečení je opotřebované a všichni dospělí na něj křičí a pravidelně ho pronásleduje děsivý pes!) a bije, s křikem a pláčem a Spielbergovým zázračným emotingem. Pro mě je upřímnost přesvědčivější a osobnější, když je tichá a přímá; když na mě někdo vykřikuje své názory, předpokládám, že je buď opravdu naštvaný, nebo se jen snaží přemoci mé smysly, aby mi zabránil vyjádřit svůj vlastní názor. Hugo byl jeden dlouhý výkřik, pokud jde o mě.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Proč se Amélie nezeptala na ten pocit podvádění? Uznávám, že Amélie a Moulin Rouge jsou obě velké, manipulativní, umělé konstrukce ve stejném duchu, vyžadující specifické emoce v určitých intervalech a snažící se prodat tyto emoce s těžkým emotivním a agresivním soundtrackem. Ani jeden z nich mě neprodal svým emocím jako autentickému lidskému pocitu. To, co jsem si v těchto dvou filmech užil, byla stavba - zejména Améliiny opojné, směšné seznamy náhodných charakterizujících funkcí a zkušeností pro její obsazení, a Moulin Rougeovy hudební mashupy a rekontextualizace. Často jsem prodán na příběhy, které dělají kreativní nebo ambiciózní věci se strukturou, a oba tyto filmy se kvalifikují, kde je Hugo mnohem lineárnější, standardní dítě.<br/><br/>Ale nakonec, pro mě, to opravdu přijde k pocitu, že ty filmy jsou pitomci, zatímco Hugo je třeba brát vážně v každém okamžiku. Nemyslíte si, že je to pravda - ale současně bráníte jeho integritu, pokud jde o jeho naprosto autentickou, zakořeněnou v historii Scorseseho, a říkáte mi, že se mýlím, a on to nemyslí vážně. A co ten film, který vám napovídá, že to nemá být bráno za nominální cenu? A je možné, že je to jen další podivuhodný případ Benjamina Buttona, kde je použití dětí ve velkorozpočtových filmech do značné míry sappy a melodramatické, zatímco vy jako otec zjistíte, že to obchází váš cynismus a jde přímo k vašemu rodinnému pocitu?<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Scott: Nejsem si jistý, jestli jsem tím myslel, že Scorsese nechce být brán vážně; je to jen to, že si vybral rozmarné vozidlo, jehož prostřednictvím vyjadřuje vážnou lásku k filmům. Když řeknete, "Ale Hugo není primárně o filmu, navzdory Méliho kravatám," jsem zmatený. Připouštím, že shledáváte mnoho prvků Huga příliš povědomými a pracnými a plnými Spielbergovských podivuhodných emocí – není nic, co bych mohl udělat, abych se o tomto vnímání, které sdílí další Hugoví pochybovači, hádal. Někdy film znamená okouzlit a okouzlit, a pro některé to není; vy máte Huga a já Amélii, i když si myslím, že to druhé, záměrně umělé, pro nás znamená, že to považujeme za romantické. (Spíše než, řekněme, nějaká strašná mechanická mašinka vhodná pro pokračování Saw.)<br/><br/>Ale říct, že Hugo není primárně o filmu? Pokud to není o filmu, pak je to nejvíce nesmyslně diskurzivní příběh o [cokoliv si myslíte, že je o] jsem kdy viděl. Vztah mezi Hugem a Méliésem je srdcem filmu a jádrem toho není jen nějaké spojení mezi Plucky Orphan a Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, ale společná afinita pro umělou magii - konkrétně kouzlo filmů. Myslím, že Scorsese a jeho spolupracovníci našli způsob, jak vyjádřit své nadšení v prvních dnech kinematografie prostřednictvím fantazie, která je přístupná všem věkovým kategoriím. Dětský příběh plný archetypů je zde pouze kůra; kino je koláč. (Mmmm... koláč.)<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Co se týče Podivuhodného případu Benjamina Buttona, nevidím moc spojitosti, kromě toho, že se mě snažím odhalit jako obránce Benjamina Buttona jako způsob, jak poškodit mou důvěryhodnost. (Mimochodem, jak jsou na tom komparzisté na G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray?) Říkala jsem ti, že ten usnulý táta ve mně byl možná zranitelný vůči Benjaminu Buttonovi, ale nedokážu si představit dobu, kdy by mě předpoklad stárnutí v opačném směru nepohnul. A kromě toho nechápu, jak se Benjamin Button vztahuje k Hugovi jako k filmu o dětech, protože to je jen malá část příběhu, která se rozprostírá na mnohem větší trajektorii.<br/><br/>Takže jsem vás přesvědčil? Pravděpodobně ne. Ale jsem rád, že jsem se dozvěděl, že Hugo nebyl zcela bez kouzla pro vás. Sekvence na Mélies filmař je to, co pro mě Hugo přes - a v tom, že alespoň můžeme sdílet nějakou filmovou lásku.<br/><br/>Reklamy<br/><br/>Tasha: Ne, nemůžu říct, že jsi mě přesvědčila, stejně jako já tebe. Je nemožné někoho přesvědčit o viscerální lásce k čemukoliv a opravdu by mělo být stejně nemožné někoho odvrátit od viscerální lásky. Většinou jste mi dovolili vidět Huga ve filmu Scott-O-Vision, což je zajímavá zkušenost; alespoň jsem teď mírně přesvědčen, že se nám nějak nepodařilo vidět zcela odlišné filmy, které měly jaksi stejné jméno a režiséra.<br/><br/>Určitě jsme však měli různé zkušenosti a podle mého názoru se zaměřili na různé aspekty produkce: stále nevidím téma "film je úžasný" jako jediný pramen filmu, ani jeden z příliš mnoha. "Zbytečně diskurzivní" to skoro pokrývá, i když bych to "často zbytečně roztomilé a drahé" navíc. Zatímco se soustředíte na chutnou koláčovou náplň filmu, mám pocit, že ten koláč byl pokrytý librou krystalizovaného cukru a myslím, že to dělá rozdíl, bez ohledu na hlavní poselství filmu nebo hrstku úžasných scén. Podívejte se také na Benjamina Buttona, kterého jsem nevychoval jen proto, abych vás zmlátil – opravdu si myslím, že máte více sentimentální sklony než já, pokud jde o děti v kině, zvláště když jsou používány spíše jako symboly zranitelnosti a nevinnosti než jako lidské postavy. Víte, který film nemá roztomilé mopety se širokýma očima, které přinášejí naději do cynického světa? G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Možná se půjdu podívat na ty doplňky na Blu-ray. Mohl bych použít nějaký výbušný inzulín, abych kompenzoval Hugovu sladkost. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Doufala jsem, že moje dcera bude osvobozena od těžkých a znepokojivých časů": Příběh Mee Mee jako uprchlické matky<br/><br/>Naděje v dobách krize: Den matek<br/><br/>Od tohoto Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee slyšel, že přicházejí vojáci. Uchopila svého syna a zběsile se připojila k ostatním vesničanům, kteří běželi k thajsko-barmské hranici, kde se nacházel Úřad Vysokého komisaře OSN pro uprchlíky (UNHCR). Její manžel byl v jiné vesnici běžící opačným směrem, Mee se později dozvěděla. Po skončení pronásledování vojáků se Mee vrátila domů do své malé vesnice v Koechi v Barmě.<br/><br/>V letech 1997-2000 žila Mee a tisíce dalších lidí pod neustálou hrozbou násilí ze strany barmských vojáků. Mnoho lidí našlo dočasné útočiště v džungli a vrátili se domů do své vesnice poté, co vojáci opustili oblast, jen aby to udělali znovu o několik dní později. Asi jednou týdně by Mee a další byli v pohybu, aby se vyhnuli zajetí, znásilnění nebo smrti vojáků.<br/><br/>Během jednoho incidentu Mee manžel běžel před svou ženou, aby zajistil jídlo pro svou rodinu. Její manžel byl spatřen vojáky a zastřelen. Kulka roztříštila část jeho hrudníku a zanechala ho těžce zraněného a v tísni, když se vydal se svou rodinou do džungle pro bezpečí.<br/><br/>Po dobu tří měsíců se Meeův manžel skrýval a přemístil rodinu s podrážděnou ránou po boku. Nedostávalo se mu žádné lékařské péče, kromě toho, že Mee měl ošetřování.<br/><br/>"Bála jsem se vrátit do Barmy," řekla Mee přes tlumočníka. "Bála jsem se umírání. Plakala jsem a plakala každý den," pokračovala.<br/><br/>Meein manžel nakonec načerpal dostatek síly, aby pět dní vykročil do malé vesnice v Thajsku, kde se dozvěděli, kde se nachází nemocnice a uprchlický tábor. Když Mee a její manžel konečně dorazili do nemocnice, podstoupil okamžitou operaci a později se zotavil.<br/><br/>Symbol naděje<br/><br/>Život v džungli pro ty, kteří prchají před barmskými vojáky, byl opravdu děsivý a obtížný. Provizorní bambusové stany s pouze střechou a podlahovými krytinami se staly vhodnými dočasnými obydlími. Mnoho žen včetně Mee porodila děti v džungli. Meeův tehdy šestiletý syn asistoval při porodu své sestry Eh Ku Hser. Její jméno znamená láska – zima – sladká. "Studený" v barmské kultuře znamená, aby neprocházel ohněm života, protože teplo představuje neklidné časy.<br/><br/>"Doufala jsem, že moje dcera bude osvobozena od těžkých a znepokojivých časů," řekla Mee. "Nechtěla jsem, aby prošla tím, co jsem prožila já," pokračovala.<br/><br/>Pro Mee bylo narození její dcery uprostřed temnoty, muk a strachu symbolem naděje na nový život. Naděje v krizových dobách, samotný předpoklad UMCOR (United Methodist Committee on Relief) nově spoluznačkové svíčky UMCOR-Prosperity, je také podstatou toho, na co svíčky vrhají světlo.<br/><br/>Nový začátek<br/><br/>S pomocí UNHCR se naděje na nový život skutečně zhmotnila pro Mee a její rodinu, když se přestěhovali do West Springfieldu v Massachusetts. Tam se Mee setkala s Moo Kho Paw, další ženou, která emigrovala z Barmy a která pracovala v Prosperity Candle ve Florencii. Organizace pomáhá uprchlickým ženám, které uprchly z oblastí konfliktu, obnovit své životy prostřednictvím umění výroby svíček. Moo Kho doporučil, aby se Mee připojil k organizaci, a Mee s radostí přijal.<br/><br/>"Byla jsem nadšená, že jsem mimo dům," řekla Mee, "byla jsem vychována, abych věřila, že protože jsem žena, má role je zůstat doma a vychovávat svou rodinu." "Zatímco mnoho barmských žen chce udělat více pro sebe, jsou často povzbuzovány, aby zůstaly doma."<br/><br/>Dnes má Mee v plánu jít do výroby svíček pro sebe a podporovat svých pět dětí, ale vyjádřila potřebu nejprve se naučit anglicky.<br/><br/>"V thajském uprchlickém táboře jsme měli vzdělání, ale nebylo to tak dobré," řekl Mee. "Když jsem byl dítě, chtěl jsem jít do školy, ale bylo mi řečeno, abych zůstal doma, protože jsem žena. Nyní doufám, že mé dcery půjdou na vysokou školu a stanou se doktorkami nebo policistkami,“ pokračovala Mee.<br/><br/>Mee dosáhla ve svém životě rovnováhy, kterou by si přála, aby nalezli jiní - jednoduchý, šťastný život, kde práce, péče o rodinné příslušníky a svoboda volby mají své místo.<br/><br/>Uprchlické ženy v USA<br/><br/>Podělte se o tento příběh se svými blízkými. A když si koupíte ručně vyrobené svíčky Mee, Moo Kho a Naw, další barmská uprchlice pracující v Prosperity Candle, víte, že pomáháte podporovat jejich živobytí, když obnovují své životy a životy svých rodinných příslušníků v USA. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Precedenční esej<br/><br/>1562 slov - 7 stran<br/><br/>Pozitivní opatření je vládní politika, která dává příležitosti menšinám, ženám a jakékoli skupině, která se v minulosti stala obětí diskriminace. Afirmativní akce je výsledkem hnutí za občanská práva z roku 1960, vycházejícího ze zákona o občanských právech z roku 1964, který postavil mimo zákon diskriminaci na základě rasy, etnického původu nebo pohlaví. Bylo to rozhodnutí Nejvyššího soudu z roku 1978, The Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke, které umožňovalo použití rasových preferencí jako prostředku podpory rozmanitosti, což umožnilo použití afirmativních opatření v přijímacích politikách. Byla vytvořena s cílem poskytnout rovné příležitosti pro členy menšinových skupin ve vzdělávání a ...zobrazit uprostřed dokumentu ...<br/><br/>Podle zprávy Pew Research Center z roku 2007 se podpora pozitivních opatření mezi americkou veřejností v posledních letech podstatně zvýšila, z 58 % v roce 1995 na 70 % v roce 2007. Zastánci afirmativní akce předkládají mnoho argumentů na podporu afirmativní akce v naději, že ostatní uvidí skutečné dobro, které politika afirmativního aktu přináší naší společnosti. Příznivci věří, že afirmativní akce je spíše procesem než politikou přijímání. Vysoké školy a univerzity přebírají další iniciativu, aby oslovily menšinové skupiny a povzbudily je, aby se přihlásily. Vysoké školy a univerzity nabízejí další finanční pomoc a poskytují zdroje na akademické půdě, aby pomohly zlepšit vysokoškolské vzdělání studenta. Příznivci také poznamenávají rostoucí počet žádostí menšin na vysokých školách a univerzitách, částečně kvůli politikám pozitivních akcí.<br/>Statistiky ukázaly, že když je afirmativní akce eliminována, například když to bylo na Berkley College a UCLA v roce 1998, menšinové studentské přijetí kleslo o 61 procent a 36 procent, což dokazuje, že afirmativní akce hraje hlavní roli v procesu přijímání studentů menšin. Příznivci pozitivních akcí také věří, že rozmanitost ve vysokoškolském vzdělávání poskytuje lepší vzdělávací atmosféru pro všechny studenty, osobně i intelektuálně. Pokud by byla afirmativní akce eliminována, bylo by méně menšinových studentů zapsaných na vysokých školách, což by způsobilo, že rozmanitost by byla poměrně štíhlá. Politiky afirmativních akcí jsou také nezbytné pro kompenzaci staletí rasového, ekonomického a sociálního útlaku. Jedinci s vyšším socioekonomickým postavením mají více příležitostí než lidé s nižším socioekonomickým zázemím. Příznivci se domnívají, že určité rasové nebo etnické skupiny jsou znevýhodněny, protože jsou často v domácnostech s nižšími příjmy, a proto nejsou vystaveni stejným zdrojům jako studenti z vyšších socioekonomických tříd. Zastánci podporují pojem konkurence mezi studenty na základě zásluh, ale tvrdí, že afirmativní akce kompenzuje ekonomické rozdíly. Absolventi vysokých škol, kteří těžili z afirmativní akce, také uvedli, že získali lepší práci, vydělali více peněz a celkově žijí lepší život kvůli šťastným příležitostem, které získali prostřednictvím afirmativní akce.<br/>Zastánci afirmativních opatření neustále zdůrazňují závažný význam afirmativních opatření, přičemž berou v úvahu jejich přínos ke zlepšení jak vysokoškolských zkušeností, tak společnosti obecně. Odpůrci afirmativní akce se však domnívají, že nastal čas ukončit afirmativní akci. Odpůrci věří, že afirmativní akce byla vytvořena s cílem zajistit spravedlivé postupy přijímání, aby přinesla změnu dlouhého období rasové diskriminace. Věří, že tato politika je zastaralá.“ Je na čase vytáhnout zástrčku na rozhodování založeném na rase, "říká Ward Connerly, obchodník ze Sacramenta v Kalifornii a hlavní organizátor...<br/><br/>Najděte další esej o precedenci<br/><br/>Ačkoli Jackson vytvořil a podepsal vše pro Indian Removal Act, zákon by nebyl uveden v platnost až po Jacksonově předchůdci.<br/>Myšlenka mít národní banku byl nový návrh v Americe v roce 1800.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinace<br/><br/>Kombinace jsou obrana proti úderu, choreografické reakce na různé typy útoků. Mají mnoho jmen napříč bojovými uměními, ale (podle mých zkušeností) každé umění má jejich verzi. To je odlišuje od forem, protože existuje spousta bojových umění, které nemají žádné formy. Proč cvičit konkrétní odpověď, když (ve skutečnosti) načasování, typ útoku, velikost útočníka, a sto dalších faktorů bude dělat to tak, že nikdy použít celý choreografii odpověď? A konečně, jak můžeme trénovat pro skutečnou obrannou situaci a zároveň se vyhnout zranění?<br/><br/>Univerzálnost kombinací je přinejmenším působivá. Náš styl Kenpo karate má seznam 108 komba, které se lze naučit. (Většina studentů se však učí pouze 20-30) V brazilském Jiu-Jitsu trávíte celé třídy cvičením paží a tlumivek, učíte se každou jemnost pohybu, zatímco váš partner nabízí malý nebo žádný odpor. Každý boxer strávil hodiny před sáčkem a / nebo zrcadlem házením stejné kombinace úderů, dokud se jejich tělo nepohybuje reflexem. Kombinace jsou univerzální, protože nemáme lepší způsob, jak zavést pohyb a pak praktikovat jemné pozice potřebné k tomu, aby fungovaly. Bít malý tlakový bod přes oblečení vyžaduje hodně praxe, chytání ramenní tyče s ovládáním vyžaduje pečlivě umístěný bok a záludné nastavení a skvělá kombinace je užitečná pouze tehdy, pokud ji můžete projít z vyvážené a chráněné pozice. Napadá vás lepší způsob, jak tyto dovednosti získat?<br/><br/>Existuje celá řada faktorů, které určují, jak budete reagovat na útok a zda v zápase nebo v boji, jsem NIKDY nepoužil plnou kombinaci v mé obraně. Cvičíme tyto choreografické odpovědi, protože cílem není vytáhnout kombinaci 8 pokaždé, když vidíte háček, ale ukázat vám jeden způsob, jak ji blokovat a pak možný způsob, jak ji sledovat. Nikdy jsem se nerozhodl použít kombinaci 3 v situaci reality, ale blok je jedním z mých pohybů. Kombinace přidávají nástroje do sady nástrojů, které neopravují auto.<br/><br/>Poslední otázka je otázka bezpečnosti. Pokud cvičíme kvůli realitě, musíme realitu replikovat. Jak předcházet zranění? Když na to přijde, je to o budování důvěry. Začínáme pomalu a učíme se věřit, že máme kontrolu nad sebou. Naučíme se věřit, že naši partneři mají kontrolu také. Ve více času se učíme důvěřovat naší kontrole nad naším partnerem a (trochu děsivější) se učíme důvěřovat kontrole našeho partnera nad námi. Nakonec (se spoustou tréninku) se můžete pohybovat plnou rychlostí, házet svého partnera a být hozen beze strachu ze zranění.<br/><br/>Kombinace jsou univerzální z nějakého důvodu; jsou praktikovány, aby mohly být rozděleny na své části, a my zůstáváme v bezpečí tím, že začínáme pomalu a budujeme důvěru. Stejně jako u všeho ostatního v bojových uměních, kombinace mají mnoho důvodů pro jejich praxi a popravu. |
