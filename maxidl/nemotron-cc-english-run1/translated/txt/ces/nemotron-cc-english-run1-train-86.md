| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Historická čtvrť Leclaire, kdysi označovaná jako Edwardsvilleovo "předměstí na jihu", byla založena jako družstevní komunita v roce 1890 a zůstala samostatnou vesnicí až do připojení k městu Edwardsville v roce 1934. Noviny a časopisy po celých Spojených státech a Evropě informovaly o experimentu Leclaire, zejména během prvních 20 let jeho existence. V roce 1979 byla kvůli své jedinečné historii bývalá obec zapsána do Národního registru historických míst.<br/><br/>Leclaire byl založen Nelsonem Oliverem Nelsonem, výrobcem instalatérů v St. Nelson chtěl zlepšit pracovní podmínky pro své zaměstnance a poskytnout bydlení v blízkosti továren, aby se dělníci a jejich rodiny mohli snadno účastnit rekreačních a vzdělávacích programů, které společnost nabízí zdarma. Louis, výrobní a distribuční podniky společnosti N. O. Nelson začaly poskytovat sdílení zisku spolu se vzdělávacími a rekreačními příležitostmi. Kooperativní experiment Leclaire by přinesl další výhody.<br/><br/>Když zaměstnanci Nelsonu naznačili, že se chtějí přestěhovat na venkov, zástupci společnosti oslovili vedoucí malých měst v několika komunitách Missouri a Illinois v blízkosti jejich sídla v St. Hledali vhodnou nemovitost pro výstavbu nových továren a vzorové vesnice. Jižně od Edwardsville našli 125-akrový kus půdy s přístupem k vodě, uhlí a dopravě. Místní podnikatelé jednali rychle, aby nabídli finanční pobídku. Za méně než tři týdny komunita získala fond ve výši 20 000 dolarů z individuálních příspěvků ve výši od 1 do 1 000 dolarů, aby přilákala Nelsona, aby si vybral Edwardsville pro svůj podnik.<br/><br/>Představitelé města doufali, že najdou nemovitost uvnitř městských hranic Edwardsville, ale když nebylo možné najít vhodné místo, byli přesvědčeni, že investice Nelson jižně od města se brzy stane součástí Edwardsville. Přestože Nelson ve své smlouvě splnil všechny předpoklady pro výstavbu a tvorbu pracovních míst, bylo by to 44 let před připojením k Edwardsville. Leclaire, ohraničené Madison / Brown Avenue na východě, železniční tratě na západě, Hadley / McKinley Avenue na jihu a Wolf Street na severu, zůstal nezávislou vesnici od roku 1890 do roku 1934. Během této doby získala reputaci za inovace v oblasti podnikání, vzdělávání a bytového plánování.<br/><br/>Vesnice Leclaire na mapě Edwardsville z roku 1931<br/>S laskavým svolením Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsonovo rozhodnutí postavit vesnici nebylo učiněno z rozmaru. Koncem 80. let 19. století byl mezinárodním lídrem v oblasti spolupráce a sdílení zisku, vyměňoval si sociální teorie s ostatními po celém světě a zároveň rozšiřoval svůj obchod v St. Svou experimentální vesnici pojmenoval po pařížském obchodníkovi se ziskem Edme Jean Leclaire, ale navštívil mnoho dalších sociálních vizionářů, kteří poskytovali informace a inspiraci. Když Nelson z těchto příkladů sestavoval ty nejlepší nápady, založil Leclaire, aby podle jeho slov "dal práci, podporoval inteligenci, poskytoval rekreaci, pěstoval krásu a vytvářel domovy." To byly všechny faktory, které určil jako nezbytné pro to, aby muži vedli naplňující životy. Pozdější spisovatelé používali tato slova k formulaci Leclaireho základních principů: Práce, Domovy, Vzdělávání, Rekreace a Krása, ale s dalším důležitým principem Svobody.<br/><br/>Práce<br/><br/>Práce by mohla být považována za nejdůležitější z těchto faktorů, protože bez továrních pracovních míst v Leclaire by nebyla žádná vesnice. Zděné tovární budovy byly navrženy architektem E.A. Cameronem tak, aby poskytovaly přirozené světlo, větrání v létě a vytápěné podlahy v zimě. Existoval protipožární systém, a přestože nebyly odstraněny průmyslové havárie, bylo vynaloženo veškeré úsilí k zajištění bezpečnosti pracovníků. Zděné budovy pokryté břečťanem byly obklopeny dobře udržovanými trávníky a květinovými zahradami, které dávaly komplexu vzhled školního areálu. V roce 1894 reportérka New York World Nellie Bly nazvala budovy "ideální dokonalost budov pro člověka, aby pracoval".<br/><br/>Výrobní komplex výrobní společnosti N. O. Nelson v Leclaire<br/>Od přátel Leclaire<br/><br/>Politika společnosti Nelson byla navržena tak, aby chránila finanční stabilitu zaměstnanců. Pracovníci mohli získat podíl na zisku a mít hlas ve společnosti, pokud se rozhodli tuto možnost. Plán sdílení zisku dal zaměstnancům Nelsonu hrdost na vlastnictví, která vyústila v podpůrnou pracovní sílu. V průběhu let došlo k několika krátkodobým pracovním stávkám, ale z větší části byly pracovní problémy vzácné. Pracovníci měli také přiměřenou pracovní dobu a konkurenceschopnou mzdu. Existoval providerský fond, který zajišťoval důchody a nemocenskou dovolenou, stejně jako vdovské důchody, pokud pracovník zemřel, bez ohledu na to, zda smrt souvisela s jeho zaměstnáním.<br/><br/>Sídlo společnosti N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) zůstalo v St. Louis, ale celá výrobní společnost N. O. Nelson byla přesunuta do Leclaire. Výrobní společnost byla rozdělena do obchodů, které vyráběly různé produkty. V roce 1900 se obchody staly nezávislými společnostmi pro daňové účely, ale všechny byly stále vlastněny výrobní společností N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Zruční řemeslníci, kteří zde pracovali, také plnili speciální zakázky, včetně pokladních klecí pro místní banku a oltáře stále používaného v biskupském kostele sv. Ondřeje v Edwardsville. Mramorová prodejna se specializovala na architektonický mramor, který byl vyřezán a instalován Nelsonovými posádkami v domácnostech, podnicích a dokonce i v hlavních městech po celém Středozápadě. Strojovna, která se stala Bignall a Keeler, vyráběla potrubní armatury, čerpadla, měřidla a různé mechanické nástroje, které se očekávaly v instalatérském průmyslu. Také se v polovině 90. let 20. století rozvětvily na výrobu speciálních předmětů, jako je jízdní kolo Leclaire. Součástí mosazi byla slévárna, kde se vyráběly různé instalatérské trubky a nástroje. Tyto příklady představují jen část práce vykonané v továrnách Leclaire. Logo společnosti bylo stylizované "NONCO", které lze stále vidět na instalatérských svítidlech a některých požárních hydrantech v Edwardsville dnes.<br/><br/>Domovy<br/><br/>Než mohly být postaveny domy, bylo zapotřebí bydlení pro pracovníky, kteří dokončovali tovární budovy, stejně jako stavěli domy. K uspokojení těchto potřeb společnost postavila "Club House", velkou budovu, která sloužila mnoha účelům. Kromě ubytování to byla první vzdělávací budova komunity a obsahovala dobře zásobenou knihovnu.<br/><br/>Výstavba obytné části Leclaire začala bezprostředně po založení vesnice v červnu 1890. Inovativní krajinářský architekt Julius Pitzman, který v Leclaire vystavěl první parcely, je postavil do řady ochranných smluv. Smlouvy stanovily široké, křivočaré ulice, velké pozemky a listinné omezení, které omezovalo nemovitosti pouze na obytné nebo vzdělávací účely. Společnost vydláždila ulice, poskytla elektrická pouliční světla, instalovala chodníky a zasadila stovky stromů podél ulic Leclaire. Pozdější části Leclaire byly navrženy s konvenční mřížkou a menšími částmi, ale stále zahrnovaly omezení listin.<br/><br/>Leclaire viktoriánská chata v roce 1907<br/>Cindy Reinhardtová<br/><br/>Zpočátku byly domy postaveny společností a poté prodány zaměstnancům Nelson za téměř cenu, aby podpořily vlastnictví domů. Pokud pracovník onemocněl a nemohl si hypotéku, platby byly pozastaveny až po návratu do práce. Domy byly nabízeny v různých designech domů a společnost inzerovala, že žádné dva byty nejsou stejné. Nejstarší domy byly především viktoriánské chaty, které přišly s elektřinou a tekoucí vodou. Po nich následovaly bungalovy, čtverce a dokonce i některé kitové domy. Obyvatelé si mohli koupit dům postavený společností nebo si koupit prázdný pozemek a postavit dům sami, za předpokladu, že architektonický návrh splňoval firemní standardy.<br/><br/>V pozdějších letech byly pozemky prodány investorům, obvykle obyvatelům Edwardsville, a mnoho domů ve 20. letech bylo postaveno místními dodavateli, kteří je pak prodali obyvatelům oblastí.<br/><br/>Vzdělání<br/><br/>Nelson věřil ve vzdělávání pro všechny, včetně dělnické třídy. Vzdělávací programování začalo s mateřskou školou v Club House v roce 1892 a pokračovalo v nové vzdělávací budově na 722 Holyoake Road. Běžně nazývaná "školní dům", tato budova poskytovala velký sál pro setkání a programy, ale měla pohyblivé oddíly, které ji během dne rozdělily na učebny. Ve večerních hodinách se konaly tance, setkání nebo programy Leclaire Self-Culture Club, které představovaly týdenní přednášky profesorů Washingtonské univerzity nebo národně známých řečníků, kteří, stejně jako N. Mezi ně patřili Jane Addamsová, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones a spisovatelka Charlotte Perkins Gilmanová.<br/><br/>Děti zapsané do školky v Leclaire v roce 1913<br/>Cindy Reinhardtová<br/><br/>Během deseti let následujících po výstavbě vzdělávací budovy v roce 1895 proběhla řada vzdělávacích experimentů, včetně průmyslové školy, vysoké školy, noční školy a akademie. Nejstarším a nejdéle trvajícím úsilím byla ranní mateřská škola, založená v roce 1892, která používala frebelský model. Tento dvouletý program byl zdarma pro všechny, včetně dětí Edwardsville, až do roku 1931, kdy z finančních důvodů společnost začala účtovat školné studentům, kteří nebyli dětmi zaměstnanců. Nelson Manufacturing provozoval mateřskou školu až do roku 1934, kdy byla budova za nominální poplatek předána školnímu okrsku Edwardsville.<br/><br/>Rekreace<br/><br/>Lodě na jezeře Leclaire v roce 1915<br/>Cindy Reinhardtová<br/><br/>Důležitým rysem Leclaire byla rekreace. Společnost poskytovala sportovní zázemí pro baseball, tenis a později fotbal. Byla postavena bowlingová a kulečníková hala a v zimě zde bylo jezero pro plavbu na lodičkách, plavání, rybaření nebo bruslení. Leclaire Park byl vybaven loděnicemi, mužskými a ženskými lázněmi a velkým pavilonem. Obyvatelé pořádali tance, hayridy, hláskovací včely a další aktivity a společnost sponzorovala kapelu, která pravidelně hrála na zábavách ve vesnici nebo v Edwardsville. Stejně jako vzdělávací funkce v Club House a School House, rekreační zařízení v Leclaire byly otevřeny pro všechny a byly často cílem pro Edwardsville a dokonce i St.<br/><br/>Krása<br/><br/>Fotografie jezera Leclaire<br/>Cindy Reinhardtová<br/><br/>Poslední z faktorů, které Nelson považoval za důležité pro uspokojující život, se týkaly životního prostředí. Nelson věděl o důležitosti zdravého života. Vážil si krásy a čistoty, které lze nalézt v zemi, a povzbuzoval všechny v Leclaire, aby zkrášlili svůj majetek výsadbou zahrad a sadů. Nelson sám vedl příkladem, takže firemní skleník za předpokladu, volné květiny a soutěže byly drženy pro nejkrásnější dvory. Leclaire byl rozložen tak, aby celá vesnice měla park-jako prostředí ještě patrné dnes.<br/><br/>Svoboda<br/><br/>Kooperativní prodejna Leclaire<br/>Cindy Reinhardtová<br/><br/>Nelson uvedl pět základních principů pro Leclaire, ale moderní spisovatelé přidávají šestý: Svoboda. Všechny programy nabízené společností byly k dispozici zaměstnancům i místním obyvatelům, ale žádné nebyly povinné. Svoboda volby, zda se účastnit firemních programů, byla zcela na jednotlivci. Obyvatelé Leclaire mohli pracovat pro Nelson Manufacturing nebo jinde a pracovníci nebyli povinni žít v Leclaire. Účast na rekreačních a vzdělávacích programech byla také nepovinná. Existovala také firemní prodejna, kde mohli zaměstnanci nakupovat, ale na rozdíl od jiných firemních měst nebyl nikdo zadlužen do firemní prodejny. Leclaire Store bylo družstvo, kde členové byli účtovány spravedlivé tržní ceny, ale pak byly vypláceny čtvrtletní dividendy.<br/><br/>Odlišné firemní město<br/><br/>Všechny tyto výhody učinily společnost Leclaire jedinečnou z jiných firemních měst. Byly však také individuální případy, kdy společnost projevila soucit a péči o zaměstnance. Společnost zavřela továrny a najala výletní vlaky, aby vzala dělníky a jejich rodiny do St. Když byly peníze napjaté, Nelson občas vložil do každé výplatní obálky peníze navíc, aby usnadnil práci, a pokud zavedl program, se kterým muži nesouhlasili, promluvili si o tom a tak často, jak ne, Nelson se obrátil.<br/><br/>Nelson byl kapitalista, který věřil ve svobodné podnikání, ale také socialista, stoupenec "zlatého pravidla" a vlastenec, který sloužil pro Unii v občanské válce. Do roku 1900 byl multimilionářem, ale v době své smrti v roce 1922 to všechno rozdal pro zlepšení dělnické třídy.<br/><br/>Ačkoliv Leclaire nebyl Nelsonovým jediným sociálním experimentem, je považován za jeho nejúspěšnější snahu. Další velké úsilí o sociální zlepšení zahrnovalo řetězec družstevních obchodů s potravinami v New Orleans, mateřskou školu pro děti černých zaměstnanců v jeho Bessemeru v Alabamě, továrny a domov pro konzumenty v Indiu v Kalifornii.<br/><br/>Nelsonova vesnice Leclaire byla mezinárodně proslulá jako pozoruhodný a úspěšný experiment. To bylo popsáno v New York World při mnoha příležitostech, ale zejména reportér Nellie Bly v roce 1894, který psal o modelu města, kde "Pracovní otázka je vyřešena a všichni šťastní v malé vesnici nedaleko St. Los Angeles Times také pravidelně informoval o N. O. Nelsonovi, stejně jako Chicago Daily Tribune a mnoho dalších publikací.<br/><br/>V projevu na oslavě 15. výročí Leclaire v roce 1915 Nelson řekl: "Leclaire vám nabízí širokou otevřenou pohostinnost a nabídky, které si dnes užíváte snadnost a pohodlí a krásu a inspiraci, které si užíváme každý den." Od té doby uplynulo více než sto let, ale pozvání stále platí. Obyvatelé a výzkumníci jsou zváni, aby se dozvěděli o historii Leclaire a zvážili lekce, které by se mohly naučit pro zlepšení budoucích generací.<br/><br/>Jedna z bývalých budov výrobního komplexu v roce 2019, která nyní slouží jako N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autor Návštěvy přes Zoom nebo Skype<br/><br/>Skype je skvělá volba pro školy/třídy, které nepřinášejí osobní autory, ale chtějí prozkoumat knihy a poezii, spojit se s autorem a položit otázky.<br/><br/>Náklady<br/><br/>Nabízím 30-45-minutové návštěvy Zoom nebo Skype se školami za 125 dolarů za relaci (nebo 200 dolarů za dvě relace, které se konají do tří hodin ráno nebo odpoledne; 325 dolarů za tři relace v jednom dni; 425 dolarů za čtyři relace v jednom dni). Při každém sezení se snažím děti co nejvíce aktivně zapojit. Ne, není to stejný druh spojení jako nabídky osobní návštěvy, ale pro děti to může být stále inspirativní a motivující!<br/><br/>Co dělám<br/><br/>Každé sezení až pro 50 studentů zahrnuje:<br/><br/>5 minut technologického nastavení<br/><br/>3 segmenty po 10 minutách - Vybírejte z:<br/><br/>Jak jsem se stal spisovatelem<br/><br/>Psaní této konkrétní knihy (vy si vyberete, na kterou knihu se zaměřím)<br/><br/>Čtení (čtu básně a děti mi pomáhají číst ostatní)<br/><br/>Prezentace ve třídě (vaši studenti pro mě připravili čtení nebo představení - velmi vděčné publikum!)<br/><br/>Napsat báseň společně<br/><br/>Otázky a odpovědi<br/><br/>5 minut na rozloučenou<br/><br/>Také jsem chatovat s třídami před-služby učitelů nebo skupiny v-služby učitelů o poezii a psaní.<br/><br/>Tipy pro skvělou virtuální návštěvu<br/><br/>Tipy pro úspěšnou virtuální návštěvu<br/><br/>Jedním z mých cílů pro virtuální školní návštěvy je zachytit interaktivitu, která dělá osobní návštěvy úspěšné a zábavné. Ale pravdou je, že někdy je těžké být prakticky interaktivní! Načasování se nemusí synchronizovat správně, což dělá společné čtení výzvou a je pro mě opravdu těžké slyšet jednotlivé studenty, pokud nepřijdou a nemluví přímo do mikrofonu / počítače. Ale po nějakém pokusu a omylu jsem objevil několik způsobů, jak mít co nejlepší virtuální návštěvy. Zde jsou: 10 způsobů, jak udělat svou návštěvu se svými studenty skvělým zážitkem!<br/><br/>Před návštěvou<br/><br/>Dostaňte děti co nejvíce nadšené z návštěvy. Navštivte s nimi mé webové stránky. Přečtěte si s nimi některé z mých knih. Shromážděte některé otázky, které pro mě studenti mají. Cokoliv, co uděláte předem, aby se cítil jako velký obchod, půjde dlouhou cestu směrem k zapojení studentů.<br/><br/>Umístěte videokameru nebo notebook s webovou kamerou, abych viděl co nejvíce publika. Je těžké posoudit zapojení studentů, když vidím jen pár studentů.<br/><br/>Omezte každou skupinu na 50 studentů. Je neuvěřitelně těžké zapojit velké skupiny prostřednictvím videa.<br/><br/>Přejdu rychle od tématu k tématu nebo básni k básni. Prosím, připomeňte studentům, že budou muset pozorně poslouchat, aby pochopili, co se děje.<br/><br/>Občas dělám se studenty malé Reader's Theater. Pokud vám předem pošlu nějaké napsané studentské části, vytiskněte si kopii KAŽDÉHO sezení a v případě potřeby nakrájejte na kousky.<br/><br/>Během návštěvy<br/><br/>Až budu diskutovat o knize, pokud máte tu tištěnou knihu, prosím, podržte ji, aby ji studenti viděli.<br/><br/>Vy jste můj zástupce. Často nemohu přivolat studenty a slyšet jednotlivé odpovědi. Takže bych mohl říct, "Dostaneme 3 nápady. Zvedněte ruku, pokud máte nápad." Pak to převezmeš ty, zavoláš tři studenty a oznámíš tyto odpovědi všem v místnosti a mně.<br/><br/>Vyberte si sebevědomé, odchozí studenty pro skriptované studentské části (pokud je pošlu předem). Během mých osobních školních návštěv se snažím vytáhnout některé méně sebevědomé studenty, ale zjistil jsem, že to nefunguje tak dobře během virtuálních návštěv, protože je neslyším.<br/><br/>Nechte studenty s mluvícími částmi sedět vepředu. Když je čas, nechte je vstát a připomeňte jim, aby mluvili hlasitě.<br/><br/>Při virtuálních návštěvách padá správa chování výhradně na vás. Často nevidím přesně, co se děje, takže prosím zakročte podle potřeby. Pokud dojde k velkému narušení, požádejte mě, abych na chvíli vydržel, abych nekecal, když nikdo nevěnuje pozornost:>)<br/><br/>Neváhejte mě vyfotit na obrazovce a sdílet na sociálních médiích - i když fotky mě často vypadají směšně, protože jsem dělat legrační tváře nebo tak něco, když čtu!<br/><br/>Máte-li jakékoli dotazy, zeptejte se, a to buď před, nebo během návštěvy!<br/><br/>Plánování virtuální relace<br/><br/>Máte zájem o naplánování virtuální návštěvy se mnou? Stačí mi poslat e-mail, abychom si nastavili datum, a my se odtud dostaneme |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Archiv novinek<br/><br/>Nová kniha se zabývá způsoby, jak řešit HIV-výzvy<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis s Marjorie Human, která navrhla obálku knihy, Herectví na HIV.<br/><br/>Pandemie HIV přinesla to nejlepší a nejhorší u lidí, pokud jde o reakci. Na jedné straně vyvolala stigma a násilí a na druhé straně přinesla konstruktivní a podpůrné reakce od různých jednotlivců a skupin. Nová kniha Acting on HIV, kterou vydal prof. Dennis Francis, děkan Pedagogické fakulty Univerzity Svobodného státu, se zabývá tím, jak může být drama použito k podpoře vitálních společenských změn, stejně jako individuálních změn chování.<br/><br/>Jednání o HIV nabízí systematické zkoumání dramatu jako přístupu k diskusi o HIV/AIDS a souvisejících postojích a chování. Kniha je vědeckým textem a zahrnuje práci asi dvaceti mimořádně kreativních autorů. Autory knihy jsou mimo jiné Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) a Yvonne Sliep z University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Tento projekt začal v roce 2009 a zabralo mi hodně času spojit práci mimořádně kreativních autorů. Výzkum, který je sdělován prostřednictvím knihy, je originální a včasný a významně přispívá k rozhovorům o roli / rolích a významu dramatu při řešení otázek HIV a AIDS, "říká profesor Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Studio hledalo hlavní postavu pro svou nadcházející 3D dobrodružnou hru pro PlayStation 1. Hra z pohledu třetí osoby, kde by hráči viděli hlavní postavu v plném rozsahu během každé scény.<br/><br/>Vzhledem k tomu, že hra byla o "nájezdech tajemných hrobek hluboko pod pyramidami", hlavní postava by musela vypadat dobrodružně a mít mozky, aby přežila složité nájezdové mise. Po nějakém zvažování se narodila Lara Croft, mladá, vyšší třída a naprosto britská žena, která byla stejně záhadná a inteligentní jako ona byla tvrdá a soběstačná.<br/><br/>Úspěch a kontroverze<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) byl odtržený úspěch pro Core Design, který rychle zdvojnásobil na budově Tomb Raider 2 (1997) a 3 (1998).

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Realitní slovo dne: Option<br/><br/>Možnost: Dohoda o ponechání otevřené, po stanovenou dobu, nabídku na prodej nebo pronájem nemovitosti. Možnost může být použita například k tomu, aby kupující měl čas vyřešit otázky financování, vlastnictví, územního plánování a proveditelnosti před tím, než se kupující zaváže k nákupu. Možnosti jsou často používány v procesu sestavování pozemků. Možnost musí být podpořena její skutečnou protihodnotou, oddělenou a nezávislou na kupní ceně nemovitosti. Pouhé odůvodnění protiplnění samo o sobě nepostačuje, s výjimkou možnosti leasingu, v níž jsou ustanovení leasingu sama o sobě dostatečným protiplněním na podporu této možnosti. Opce pouze vytváří smluvní právo; neposkytuje opci žádnou nemovitost v nemovitosti. V době podpisu opce vlastník nemovitost neprodává ani kupující nekoupí. I když je vlastník povinen prodat, pokud kupující dá oznámení, kupující není povinen koupit. Opce na nákup je také známá jako call; opce na prodej je známá jako put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Výhody karotenoidů pro pokožku<br/><br/>Tyto silné fytochemikálie jsou pigmentované složky nacházející se v rostlinách, které dávají květiny, ovoce a zanechává jejich žlutou, oranžovou a červenou barvu.<br/><br/>Od roku 1930 vědci identifikovali asi 800 karotenoidy a asi 40 se nacházejí v lidském těle, včetně vnější vrstvy epidermis, dermis a podkožního tuku. Nejčastějšími karotenoidy jsou beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaxanthin, lykopen a astaxanthin. Více o astaxanthinu si můžete přečíst zde.<br/><br/>Obsah karotenoidy v kůži je ovlivněn mnoha faktory, včetně příjmu ovoce a zeleniny, jejich biologické dostupnosti z různých potravin, suplementace, vystavení UV záření, znečištění ovzduší, konzumace alkoholu, kouření a stresu.<br/><br/>Jak karotenoidy pomáhají mé kůži?<br/><br/>Karotenoidy jsou jedny z nejznámějších antioxidantů pro pokožku a mají také důležité funkce jako protizánětlivé látky.<br/><br/>Zdravé stárnutí a regenerace kůže<br/><br/>Antioxidanty jsou nezbytné pro zdravou pokožku, protože pomáhají předcházet poškození buněk volnými radikály. Poškození volnými radikály způsobuje předčasné stárnutí a nástup různých typů rakoviny kůže. Karotenoidy, spolu s vitamínem E, vitamínem C a Co enzymem Q10 jsou důležité dermální antioxidanty.<br/><br/>Díky své antioxidační aktivitě karotenoidy podporují a podporují tvorbu kolagenu a elastinu v kůži. To pomáhá zvýšit hustotu, tloušťku, pružnost a pevnost pokožky. Kolagen a elastin klesají, jak stárneme, takže dostat dostatek karotenoidy ve stravě a topicky je rozhodující pro stárnutí dobře.<br/><br/>Karotenoidy mohou zlepšit známky fotostárnutí, změny barvy kůže, pružnosti, hydratace, textury a mohou snížit transepidermální ztrátu vody.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin stimuluje zejména fibroblasty k produkci kolagenu a elastinu, inhibuje aktivitu enzymů, které odbourávají kolagen a elastin, a vykazuje protizánětlivé a UV filtrační účinky. Bylo prokázáno, že snižuje melanin v kůži, což má za následek snížení vzhledu pih a melazmy.<br/><br/>Aktivita proti akné: protizánětlivá aktivita karotenoidů pomáhá tlumit zánět a podráždění spojené s akné. Karotenoidy také pomáhají normalizovat a vyvážit sekrety oleje z mazových žláz. Jsou cennými činiteli při opravě pokožky a stimulují epidermální regeneraci, čímž pomáhají vyhladit a zjemnit pokožku.<br/><br/>Kde mohu najít karotenoidy?<br/><br/>Existují dva způsoby, jak získat denní dávku karotenoidů: prostřednictvím stravy a prostřednictvím lokální aplikace. Kombinace obou je ideálním přístupem k péči o pleť.<br/><br/>Karotenoidy jsou rozpustné v tucích, takže vaše tělo potřebuje tuk, aby je absorbovalo (myslím rajčata a olivový olej, brokolice a máslo nebo špenát a avokádo). Běžné zdroje karotenoidy v potravinách jsou avokádo, žloutky, kapusta, špenát, mrkev, sladké brambory, papája a rajčata.<br/><br/>Zatímco my obhajujeme získání co nejvíce živin a antioxidantů z jídla spíše než suplementace; jedna studie ukázala, že astaxanthin v kombinaci s hydrolyzátem kolagenu významně zlepšil integritu bariéry, snížil transepidermální ztrátu vody a zvýšil expresi prokolagenu typu I mRNA.<br/><br/>Aktuální aplikace je klíčem ke zdravé pleti. Studie ukazují, že vysoké koncentrace antioxidantů v lidské kůži nabízejí nejlepší ochranu pro zdravou pleť v každém věku.<br/><br/>Ve společnosti Sarka Botanicals mícháme celé rostliny bohaté na karotenoidy, jako je měsíček, pampeliška a výtažky, jako je astaxanthin, se za studena lisovanými oleji a funkčními složkami. Měsíček samotný obsahuje více než 19 různých typů karotenoidů. To může vysvětlovat, proč má tak dlouhou historii použití v péči o pleť. Studie ukazují, že karotenoidy smíchané s koenzymem Q10 jsou zvláště účinné při snižování zánětu a zpomalování předčasného stárnutí kůže v důsledku expozice slunci. |
