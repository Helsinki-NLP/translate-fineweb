Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Póstleiðsögn<br/><br/>Life Without Papers" vinnur verðlaun sem besta skrifa verðlaun<br/><br/>Bloggið, „Life Without Papers“, búið til af Len Grant, inniheldur sögur af óskráðum innflytjendum og ungu fólki.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Gangbang Skóla Lexíur<br/><br/>Í Galatalandi fjallar Páll um málefni eins og frelsi, hlutverk lögmálsins í hjálpræðinu, ástand okkar í Kristi og eðli andans sem leiddi lífið, sem og aldagamla spurningin: Hvernig geta syndugir menn verið rétt fyrir heilagan og réttlátan Guð?<br/><br/>Margir fræðimenn telja að Galatabúar gætu verið elstu bókstafir Páls, en það var skrifað í A.D. 49, skömmu eftir hina frægu Jerúsalemráðinu (Postulasagan 15) og því kann bókin að vera elsta kristnu skjal sem vitað er um.

Þeir höfðu tólf börn, Joseph Georg Karl Frederick, katharina Charlotte Georgine Fredericka Sofie, gift þann 28. september 1805 til Prince Paul of Württemberg. Joseph Georg Friedrich Ernst Karl, hertogi af Saxe-Altenburg, frederike Luise Marie Caroline Auguste Christiane. Therese Charlotte Luise Friederike Amalie, giftur þann 12. október 1810 til King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Charlotte Luise Fredericka Amalie Alexandrine, gifti sig 24. júní 1814 til Wilhelms, hertogi af Nassau. Fran Frederick Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Frederick Wilhelm Joseph Ludwig Georg, var talinn vinsæll og greindur, á valdatíma sínum, ásamt fallegu eiginkonu sinni, Charlotte, menningarlífi í litla bænum náði Zenith. Svo margir skáld og listamenn eyddu sinni tíma í að Hildburghausen var kallaður Klein-Weimar, þegar síðasti dalurinn í Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg dó án útgáfu árið 1825 ákvað hin útibú hússins að endurskipuleggja Ernestine duches. Þann 12. nóvember 1826 varð Friðrik hertogi af Saxe-Altenburg, sem hann fékk grunnlög árið 1831, í skiptum fyrir fjölmiðla sem tengdust Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg við Wikimedia Commons.<br/><br/>Frederick, hertogi af Saxe-Altenburg<br/>–<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15.<br/>Duchess Charlotte Georgine af Mecklenburg-Strelitz<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine er fædd í Hannover og hefur starfað sem framkvæmdastjóri Brunswick-Lüneburg. Hún var elsta barn og dóttir Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, Charlotte og systur hennar, Queen Louise í Prússlandi, Queen Frederica af Hannover og Princess Theres af Thurn und Taxis, voru talin fallegustu konur af tíma þeirra. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter helgaði skáldsögu sína Títan til hins fjögurra fallega, Charlotte ólst upp í Hanover þar sem faðir hennar þjónaði sem landstjóri fyrir hönd tengdaföður síns, George III, sem bjó í London. Þegar Charlotte var tólf ára dó móðir hennar og hún var alin upp af móður sinni, Charlotte, sem giftist föður sínum árið 1784 og systur hennar ömmu sinni, var María Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg í Darmstadt. Charlotte var svo flutt til Hildburghausen þann 3. september 1785, þegar Charlotte giftist Duke Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, var hjónabandið ekki glaður, Charlotte var andlega yfirburði til Frederick, sem byrjaði að hunsa hana. Þeir höfðu einnig vandamál, Saxe-Hildburghausen hafði verið fjárhagslega eyðilagður af hörmungum Friðriks forvera. Viðtökurnar leyfðu hertogi og hertogi aðeins að stytta borgaralegan lista, Charlotte föður og tveimur bræðrum oft dvalið hjá Charlotte í Hildburghausen. Árið 1787 flutti hún til Hildburghausen og varð forseti lánanefndar bankans. Árið 1792 flugu Charlottes herinn og systur hennar áður en hann hélt frönsku hernum frá Darmstadt til Hildburghausen og hershöfðingi hennar tóku eftir Charlottes eiginmanni sínum. Charlotte, sem aldrei elskaði þennan mann, er alltaf þunguð, fjölskyldan eyddi nokkrum áhyggjulausum vikum í Hildburghausen. Árið 1793 snéri Charlottes sig aftur frá útlegðinni og ferðaðist með Charlotte systur til Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte hafði mjög hlýlegt og kærleiksríkt samband við systur sína Friederike og ættingja sína í Strelitz. Árið 1803 og 1805 heimsóttu prússneska konungskonuna Hildburghausen, fyrir þetta tilefni, sem gaf hjónanum tækifæri til að endurnýja eitthvað af húsgögnum þeirra. Louise hafði hjálpað til við að draga úr yfirlýsingu um stríð, christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg var vinur hjónanna og guðfaðir Charlottesson Edward. Margir áhorfendur voru komnir að sjá Bæjaralandsprinsessa, þegar þeir fengu gesti sína, Truchseß reyndi að leiða hina neðri flokka Charlotte fyrst í kastalanum sínum, en hún neitaði því að vísa til dóttur sinnar. Tuchseß svaraði: "Hyðing þín mun fyrirgefa mér, en svo lengi sem þessi kastali hefur staðið hér, gripu þeir aðra handlegginn og voru þeir þrír saman um hliðið.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Prins Charles í Hesse-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prince Charles of Husse-Kassel var kademían í húsi Husse-Kassels og danskur aðalsmanns. Hann fæddist ásamt ættingjum við danska hirðinn. Hann dvaldi mest af lífi sínu í Danmörku og móðir hans var dóttir Georgs 2. konungs af Bretlandi og Caroline af Ansbach og systur Queen Louise í Danmörku. Faðir hans, í framtíðinni landræmdi, yfirgaf fjölskylduna árið 1747, árið 1755 endaði hann formlega hjónabandið með Maríu. Afarðinn, William VIII, Landgrave of Hessen, veitti Mary, hinum unga Prince Charles og báðum bræðrum sínum, Vilhjálmi og Friðriki, uppvekjandi móður sinni og fóstraði kristna ættingja sína síðan 1747. Árið 1756 flutti María til Danmerkur til að annast yngri börn systur sinnar, Queen Louise í Danmörku og tók með sér sonu sína sem upphækkaðir voru við dómstólnum í Christiansborg Palace í Kaupmannahöfn. Hessan-prinsarnir voru síðar í Danmörku og urðu aðeins mikilvægir höfðingjar, elsta bróðir Vilhjálms sneri aftur til Hesse árið 1785, þegar hann hóf landnám í Danmörku. Árið 1758 var hann útnefndur einvaldur, sem var 20 stórherra, einnig árið 1766, var hann skipaður seðlabankastjóri, sem gegndi embætti sínu til ársins 1768 en hann var að mestu titíkur, eins og hann fór aldrei til Noregs á þessu tímabili. Árið 1763 giftist Karli, eldri bróðir hans, fyrsta frænda sínum, og lést 30. ágúst 1766 í Christiansborg, eiginkonu sinni, Louise of Denmark, og Charles varð þannig bróðurlögur að frændi hans, kristnu VII. Hjónabandið átti sér stað þrátt fyrir ráðleggingar gegn því, vegna afbrots áfalls af völdum Prince Charles. Skömmu eftir að Charles féll í dóminn féll og snemma 1767 hann og þeir vildu fá sitt fyrsta barn, Marie Sophie, þar árið 1767 og síðan annað barn þeirra, William, árið 1769. Árið 1778 keypti Charles eign og þorp Offenbach-Rumpenheim frá Edelsheim-fjölskyldunni og árið 1771 hafði hann hrifið út í kastala og höfðingjasæti og móðir hans María bjó í höllinni þar til hún lést árið 1772. Árið 1781 seldi Charles Rumpenheim Palace til yngri bróður síns, Charles í Gottorp Castle í Schleswig með fjölskyldu sinni. Árið 1770 gaf Kristján konungur systur sína Tegehof í Güby á milli Schleswig-borgar og Eckernförde árið 1770. Frá 1772 til 1776 var Charles með sumarleyfi sem hann nefndi Louiselund í tilefni af konu sinni, í september 1772 var Charles útnefndur stjórnandi norska hersins og hann og Louise flutti til Christiana.

Hann er talinn stofnandi Casa dEste, sem hafði verið yfirmaður fyrstu fjölskyldu sinnar til að vera húsbóndi Este, Alberto Azzo II var eini sonur Alberts Azzo I, Margrave frá Mílanó. Hann erfingi feðra sinna í kringum 1020 og jók stöðugt eignir sínar á Norður-Ítalíu, árið 1069–1070, reyndi hann að eignast Maine fyrir eiginkonu sína, Garsende, sem var samhýddur af fyrrum ættbálkum Maines. Hugh var lýst telja, en hann gat ekki ráðið gegn Robert, hertogi af Normandí, í rannsóknardeild Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, og Gregory VII, reyndi að hugleiða, en seinna gekk hann til liðs við hlið fólksins. Um 1073 gerði hann kastala í Este, sem House of Este, áður en hann byggði verkefni, Este var lítið meira en þorp. Hans Welf flutti fyrst til Carinthia og síðan til Bæjaralands og gaf honum eina af mikilvægustu fjölskyldum Evrópusögunni, ásamt öðrum syni, Fulk I í Mílanó, fyrstu skjalfesta notkun titilsins Marquis dEste.

Sumar heimildir segja að hann gifti Vitalia Orseolo, dóttur Peter Orseolo, dóttur Peter Orseolo, og hann átti auka-málefni með Matilda, systur Vilhjálms, biskups í Padúa, sem hann átti dóttur að nafni Adelasia sem giftist Guglielmo Adelardi.

Vel gifti Eteline frá Norðurheimi, dóttur Otto II, þá er hann var tengdafaðir hans, þá hafði Duke Otto orðið óvinur Hinriks 4., og varð honum skylt að konungi. Í samræmi við lög Hinriks var hann uppvíst og skilyrtur hans, Etelinde og þessi atburður átti sér stað í Goslar árið 1070, þegar ríki í Bæjaralandi sendist hljóðlega til nýfæddra sælda, sem var fulltrúi eins af fornu fjölskyldumesta í héraðinu. Uppreisn hans á deigið, sem gæti hafa talist óréttlæti, páfa og keisarar voru mjög sáttir árið 1076, en árið sá hann að þau tóku aftur þátt í virkum átökum. Henry, í ljósi endurteknra athafna uppreisnar, lýsti Welf í nýuppteknum toga sínum. Hins vegar studdist við hina trúuðu bæversku bæversku og studdist við föður sinn á Ítalíu, vel stæði hans, en Gregory lést árið 1085 og arfmenn hans tóku ekki síður mikinn þátt í stjórnmálum Þýskalands. Jæja, þó að halda enn utan um kirkjuna, eftir skilnaðinn, árið 1070, gifti Helgi Judith of Flanders, dóttur Baldwin IV, af Flanders og ekkja Tostigs Godwinson, jarls af Norðymbrasyni.

Hjónabandið var gert í maí 1127, en það stóð á milli velferðar- og Hohenstaufen-ættanna fram á 13. öld. Eftir að Lothair vann sigur, lagði hann bann við keisaralegri banni við Friðrik II.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Fylgdu okkur<br/><br/>Eruð þið<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Þurfandi sykur?

Ef þú ert með sýn á Vetrarbrautinni, til dæmis, gæti það þýtt að þú missir mjög sérstakt næringarefni í mataræði þínu.

Að auki, magnesíum lækkar á fyrirfram tíðum vikum tímabilsins, sem útskýrir hvers vegna PMS svo oft kemur með súkkulaðikrem.<br/><br/>Þess í stað, ná fyrir hágæða, lágt-sykur dökkt súkkulaði, sem er náttúrulega hátt í magnesíum. „Ég mæli með því að halda sig í 75 prósent kakó eða hærra, og para það við aðra magnesíum-ríka uppsprettu eins og sólblómafræ,“ segir Lenchewski. Hún bendir til þess að súkkulaðimerkið Hu, sem er lítið þak matvælafyrirtæki sem leggur áherslu á hágæða hráefni sem framleidd er á staðnum. „Það er lítið verðlag en allt sem þarf til að halda hlutum við skoðun,“ segir hún. „Það er persónulegt uppáhaldsatriðin mín.“ Við erum líka stór aðdáendur Superfood-pakkað Zenbunn.<br/><br/>Ef þú ert þurfandi sælgæti<br/><br/>Það þýðir: "Grein hrein sykur er góð vísbending um að þú keyrir lágt á orku," segir Lenchewski. "Hvað er það sem þú ert að klífa eftir hræðilegan nætursvefn eða á um 4 p.m. á erfiðum vinnudegi? Svarið er yfirleitt sykur vegna þess að það er notað sem augnablik eldsneyti fyrir frumur líkamans."<br/><br/>Þess í stað skaltu ná til epla með hnetusmjöri. "Ef þú ert að ala upp sælgætisst hjá vinnufélögum þínum, mæli ég með hægari kolvetni með fitu eða próteini," segir Lenchewski. Ólíkt einföldum sykri, mun þetta brenna frumurnar á meðan forðast eftir sykurhrunið. Tveir valkostir sem gera fyrir frábærar upptökur næst þegar þú ert að þrá eftir sælgæti: snefil epla með val þitt á smjöri, eða berjum með 2% óæskilegum grískri jógúrt."

"Salt hjálpar líkamanum að halda í vatni, svo við þráum það þegar við erum í þörf vökva."<br/><br/>Í staðinn, ná að vatni. "Vertu vökvaður, sérstaklega þegar við náum sumarmánuðum," segir hún,.

Ef venjulegt vatn fæðir þig, prófaðu að bæta við í myntum, sítrónu eða frystum ávöxtum til að blanda því saman,“ segir Lenchewski. Og ef það gerir ekki bragð, þá er betra að geyma flögur eða eldsvoða. "Ef þú ert virkilega bara að þurfa salt eftir allt, ristað hafsbotn er mikill lítill valkostur," segir hún.<br/><br/>Ef þú ert að leita að stjörnuhýsum eins og pasta<br/><br/>Það þýðir: "Vegna þess að hágæða karb matvæli auka tilfinninguna fyrir hormóna serótónín, getur sterkir þrá verið merki sem þú þarft á skap hvatamaður," segir Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Þess í stað skaltu ná í bað! "Stundstu út í Epsom salt, því það er kominn tími fyrir alvarleg R+R," segir Lenchewski. "Reyndu mér. (Eins og hver sem hefur nokkurn tíma lokið pizzu eða pasta þrá veit.)

Fyrir ísfrumur mælum við með því að ísinn sé minni ís-í-sykur eins og kókosolíu eða Kippy's þrí innihaldsefni ís í Los Angeles.“ Við getum borið þá staðreynd að íssbragði kókoskremsins er ótrúlegt og eins og hið raunverulega.<br/><br/>Ef þú ert að þurfa hamborgara<br/><br/>Það þýðir: Þú þarft járn. "Ef þú getur ekki hætt að hugsa um rautt kjöt, þá eru líkurnar á að líkami þinn sé að þurfa járn, b12 og flóksýru," segir Lenchewski.

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Nú getur þú sent mikilvægar upplýsingar um allan heim með einum músarsmell, þökk sé internettengingu. Því miður hefur þetta víðtæka tengingu og vinsældir meðal fólks, internetið einnig aukið líkurnar á tölvuglæpi. Internet glæpir eða tölvuglæpir eru almennt þekktar sem "Cyber Crimes".<br/><br/>Lög um netglæpagerð 'Cyber Law' er eitthvað nýtt í dómskerfinu en hefur vakið mikla athygli undanfarið. Hugtakið netglæpi er eitthvað mjög samheiti við hefðbundna glæpi, eini munurinn er miðlungs framkvæmdar. Það eru aðallega tvær tegundir af netglæpum, sá fyrsti er þar sem tölvur eru aðalmarkmiðin og þetta felur í sér tilfelli af skemmdum, illgjarnum kóða og jafnvel glæpagögnum aðgang. Annað er þar sem tölvan er aðeins með því að nota hvaða hefðbundin glæpi er skuldbundið til að tyggja nethryðjuverk, ruslpóst, netbrot og margt fleira.<br/><br/>Þetta er þar sem ráðgjafi á vefsíðu eða söluaðili kemur í vettvang. Þó að ekki sé vitað um öll netlög sem eru til staðar til þessa dags, getur vefsíðusala ráðlagt þér um sum mikilvægustu netlaga á meðan þú býrð til síðuna þína.<br/><br/>Þetta getur falið í sér almenna þekkingu á höfundarrétti eða jafnvel verndað innihald eigin vefsvæðis þíns. Að útskýra fyrir þér öllum þeim réttindum sem þú hefur sem eigandi vefsíðu er einnig verkefnin sem söluaðili vefsíðu þinnar getur gert meðan þú þróar vefsíðuna þína. Söluaðili getur einnig aðstoðað þig með því að bjóða þér upplýsingar um mismunandi netlög til að vernda gögn. Að auki getur söluaðili einnig boðið þér upplýsingar um hvaða nýju netlögum sem þú gætir verið meðvitaður um þar til þú veist. Cyber lög geta verið mismunandi frá þjóð til þjóðar, eitt nýlegt dæmi er um vafrakökulög sem gefin eru út í Bretlandi, sem kemur í veg fyrir að vefsíðan visti hvaða vafra sem er. Samkvæmt lögum um vafrakökur geta vefsíður í Bretlandi ekki vistað vafrakökuskrár án upplýsinga samþykkis frá brimbrettamanninum.<br/><br/>Það er eftir framkvæmd slíkra laga, hafa vefsíður nú pop-up glugga, sem leitar samþykkis gesta til að vista smákökur skrár. Slíkar skrár eru notaðar af vefsíðum til að greina vaframynstur gesta út frá hvaða auglýsingar eru síðan birtar á notendaglugga. Með reiðhestur ekki lengur nýtt atriði fyrir okkur öll, heldur þú að slíkar reglur og reglur geti komið í veg fyrir að á netinu séflogi eða netglæpi? Tæknin hefur þróast á hraðri hraða en samt kjósa menn ekki að versla á netinu vegna ótta við persónulegar eða bankaupplýsingar sem verða tölvusnápur. Með uppgangi netglæpa hefur þörf á strangari netalögum einnig aukist til að draga úr sama og til að stuðla að áhættulausri verslunarupplifun.<br/><br/>Tímar á Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Í gegnum árin hafa þrír helstu flokkar netglæpa:<br/><br/>Ósamþykktur aðgangur að tölvukerfum, sem felur í sér reiðhestur eða stela notandanafni og lykilorð til að fá aðgang að persónulegum upplýsingum viðkomandi notanda.Þessi tegund af bakhurð er skipulögð með hjálp Trojan Horse.

Jafnvel saga hefur orðið vitni að einhverju mesta netöryggi sem tölvusnápur hefur auðveldlega farið burt. Eina leiðin til að lækna slíka glæp er að vera meðvitaður um netlög sem við höfum í dag, sem getur annað hvort verið í gegnum internetið eða í gegnum vefsíðu/tæknisöluaðila. Upplýsingatæknilög verða að vera í jafnvægi á þann hátt að það sannar of strangt fyrir fólk sem tekur þátt í netglæpum og á sama tíma ætti það aldrei að hamla vexti internetiðnaðarins.<br/><br/>Höfundur Bio:– Maneet Puri í augnablikinu er að halda gæða vefhönnunarfyrirtæki staðsett á Nýja Delí, Indlandi.Með óviðjafnanlega sérþekkingu á tækniléni hefur hann boðið viðskiptavinum sínum faglega ráðgjöf á vefnum til viðskiptavina sinna um allan heim.
