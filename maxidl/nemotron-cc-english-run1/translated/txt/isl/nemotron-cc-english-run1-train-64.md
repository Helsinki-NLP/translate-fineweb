| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Í gegnum biblíunámskeiðin C2000 skulum við snúa okkur í bókina um lög, kafla eitt, eins og við byrjum rannsóknir okkar á frumkirkjunni.<br/>Lúkas, höfundur laga, félagi Páls postula, sem einnig var höfundur fagnaðarerindisins samkvæmt Lúkasi, skrifaði þessar tvær ritgerðir til vinar, guðspekilus. Nafnið merkir elskhuga Guðs. Það eru nokkrir sem telja að það væri alls ekki maður heldur að fagnaðarerindið og bókin um lög hafi verið beint til elskenda Guðs, sem þú gætir verið. Það eru aðrar hefðir sem segja að Þeófílus væri í raun meistaraprófsritgerð Lúkasar, en á þeim dögum voru læknar þrælar yfirleitt þrældóms ríks verndar. Svo var húsbóndi Lúkasar, og hann gaf út Lúkas til að vera með Páli í sendiförum, og er Lúkas því aftur rituð til fyrrum húsbónda síns. Þetta er snemma hefð fyrir kirkjunni, en það er auðvitað ómögulegt að sanna, eins og svo margir af þeim hefðum.<br/>Það eru líka þeir sem trúa því að þegar Páll var í Tróas og hann fékk sýn á mann er kallaði hann: "Kom þú yfir til Makedóníu og hjálpa okkur," sá maður í sýn Páls var enginn annar en Lúkas. Í fyrstu hitti Páll þegar hann kom til Makedóníu og eins og við erum í bók laga, kemstu að því að þegar við fáum að skrifa meira í fyrstu persónu frekar en þriðja aðila. Svo er það augljóslega, á þessum tímapunkti í samþykktum postulanna sem Lúkas varð félagi Páls og fór að ferðast með honum. Hann fór að nota hetjuna "við" og "okkur" í staðinn fyrir "þeir" og "þeir". Þetta er, eflaust, þar sem Luke varð þátttakandi og augavitur um þá hluti sem voru að gerast frá þessum tímapunkti.Við munum leiða þetta út til þín þegar við komumst að því.<br/>Hann byrjar lög postulanna með því að binda hana með fagnaðarerindiinu samkvæmt Lúkasi. Það er athyglisvert að það síðasta sem Lúkas skráir í fagnaðarerindi sitt er það fyrsta sem hann skráir í samþykktum postulanna. Við finnum að fagnaðarerindið um lok Lúkasar Jesú er að segja lærisveinum sínum að bíða í Jerúsalem þar til þeir eru uppteknir af valdi en Jesús steig upp til himins og svo lokaði fagnaðarerindið.<br/>1 Fyrri sögusagnirnar, guðspjallið samkvæmt Lúkasi, hef ég skrifað yður, ó guðspeki, allt sem Jesús byrjaði bæði að gera og kenna (Postulasagan 1:1),<br/>Samkvæmt Lúkasi er ekki öll saga Krists Jesú, það er aðeins upphaf þjónustu Krists Jesú heldur áfram að þjóna þörfum fólks. Jesús heldur áfram að lækna sjúka. Jesús heldur áfram að ala upp hina dánu. Jesús heldur áfram að þjóna ást sinni og fagnaðarerindii til heimsins, nú er hann aðeins að þjóna í gegnum þá lærisveina sem smurðast með heilögum anda Hans. En þjónusta Krists er áfram; í rauninni er forsenda þess að Lúkas tekur að sér lög postulanna. Fyrri sáttur við allt það sem Jesús byrjaði, bæði að gera og kenna.<br/>Af því leiðir að lög postulanna eru ólokin bók. Í því skyni heldur Drottinn áfram að vinna í gegnum líf þeirra sem hafa helgað sig því að vera verkfæri Guðs. Að leiða og leiðbeina og smyrja með heilagri anda til að halda áfram að þjóna Jesú í heiminum í dag. Nú hefur Guð ákvarðað að verk Hans ætti að rætast með mönnum. Ég segi ekki að það verði náð. Guð getur notað engla í verki sínu og það mun koma tíma í bók opinberunar þegar Guð notar engla til að boða fagnaðarerindið um allan heim. Opinberunarbókin 14 segir: „Sá fyrri engill, sem flýgur um miðju himinsins, hefur eilíft fagnaðarerindi“ (Rev 14:6). En nú hefur Guð valið að nota mannleg tæki. Eins ófullkomin og þau eru samt það sem Guð hefur ákvarðað til notkunar. Það sem er, Guð mun nota mig og Guð mun nota þig, svo oft erum við að biðja: "Ó Drottinn, ég get ekki talað, ég hef aldrei getað talað fyrir eða jafnvel núna, Drottinn." Eins og Móse reyndi að biðja um kall Guðs. Jeremía sagði: „Drottinn, ég er bara krakki. Enginn er að fara að hlusta á mig.“ Og við höfum öll okkar afsakanir af því að við getum ekki notað.“ Við vitum ekki öll ástæðurnar fyrir því að Guð gat ekki notað okkur.<br/>Eitt sinn, er Drottinn kallaði spámann til að gjöra verk sitt, sagði hann: "Herra, sendi hvern sem þú vilt." Drottinn sagði: "Hey, ég hef kallað þig." "Drottinn, góð hugmynd, senda hvern sem þú vilt." Oft erum við í þeirri stöðu: „Drottinn, sendir hvern sem þú vilt, hver sem er nema ég Drottinn.“ Og þó hefur Guð ákvarðað okkur.<br/>Nú getum við sýnt eigin ófullkomleika. Hver okkar getur bent á eigin vanhæfni okkar og við getum fundið afsökun fyrir því að Guð vildi ekki nota mig. En Guð hefur samt valið að nota þig. Þú veltir því fyrir þér hvenær Guð hefur slíkt tæki til að nota það sem hann hefur gert í gegnum líf þitt.<br/>Þar til dagurinn, sem hann var tekinn upp, eftir að hann hafði gefið postulunum, sem hann hafði valið (lögin 1:2):<br/>Það er það sem hann endaði með Lúkasi, daginn sem Jesús var tekinn upp, eftir að hann hafði sagt postulunum að bíða eftir valdleysi.<br/>8 En sá sem einnig er postulana, sýndi þeim líf eftir að hann var óhæfur (lög 1:3),<br/>Það er erfitt að neita því að upprisa Jesú Krists væri misnotuð og ég var pirruð af grein sem ég las í Santa Ana skrá þennan síðasta laugardag. Af fræði- og þróunarkenningunum sem kynntar voru í sveitaskólum, hvernig þessi prófessor sagði að hann hafi aðeins fjallað um vísindakennslu og að þeir hafi ekki neinn stað fyrir kenningar. Þar sem vísindin byggjast á staðreyndum og sköpun byggja á trúarlegum uppbyggilegum einkennum og það tekur mikla trú að trúa trúarkenningunum. Þegar þú ert að takast á við staðreyndir geturðu bara samþykkt þau. Ég hélt að „mjög áhugavert í þessum vísindaflokki, þeir kenndu mér að heimurinn var fjögur milljarða ára. Nú eru þeir að kenna það að heimurinn er tólf milljarða ára gamall. Og það var ekki svo löngu síðan að ég fór í skóla."<br/>Það er athyglisvert að Biblían hefur aldrei þurft að endurskoða eða uppfæra til að mæta núverandi gögnum sem karlar hafa uppgötvað. Og samt, ef þú myndir taka kennslubækurnar mínar í menntaskóla í dag og reyna að kenna vísindakennslu frá þeim, myndirðu finna að margir af þeim hlutum sem voru kennt eins og vísindaleg staðreynd þegar ég var ekki lengur viðurkennd sem vísindaleg staðreynd. Einfaldi frumritið er ekki lengur einfalt frumu heldur mjög flókið.Ef það er einhver staðreynd sem hægt er að sýna sögu er það staðreynd upprisu Jesú Krists frá dauðum.<br/>Við erum með lögsagnarkerfi sem byggir á vitnisburði votta. Ef einhver sakar sig um glæp og það er fólk sem hefur orðið vitni að glæpum á meðan það var framið, og þeir eru færðir til staðalsins, og þeir sverja að segja sannleikann, allt sannleikann og ekkert nema sannleikann, svo hjálpaðu þeim Guði. Og er þeir spurðu þetta, þá staðfesta eg, að maðurinn í bankanum væri tuttugu og þriðju, þá sá eg, að hann tók út byssu af kápu sinni, og spurði eg hann, að fénu sé gefið honum; sá eg hann sem hann skildi eftir bankann. Og ef þú getur fengið þrjá eða fjóra votta til þess manns og haldið vitnisburði þeirra undir krossskoðun þá er maðurinn dæmdur til sektar. Hann er sá sem gerði það. Við höfum tvær eða þrjár votta sem eru að vitna sömu söguna um manninn og það er viðurkennt eins og hann er sá sem skynjaði glæpinn og er sekur, þú hefur fengið vottanir sem hafa svarið að segja sannleikann sem eru að staðfesta.<br/>Eftir dauða Jesú, þegar hann reis upp, birtist hann mörgum mismunandi mönnum, sem báru vitni um að þeir sáu hann, að hann talaði við hann, að hann birtist þeim á ýmsum stöðum undir mismunandi kringumstæðum. Og um fjörutíu daga var að heimsækja með þeim, og á einum tíma, allt að fimm hundruð manns, sem safnað var á einum stað, birtist Hann, erfitt er að kasta sér rétt til hliðar eða neita vitnisburði þessa fólks. Til að gera það er að dreifa öllu lögboðnu kerfi okkar. En ekki það eitt, þeir menn, sem vitnaðu um að þeir sáu hinn upprisna Drottin, að þeir töluðu við Hann, að þeir neyttu allir með Honum, með þeim undantekningu eins, hittust ofríkir dauðar við hendur annarra manna vegna þess að sagan sagði þeim satt. Þú talar um vottanir til að segja sannleikann, allt sannleikann, ekkert nema sannleikurinn. Ef líf manns var ógnað vegna þess vitnisburðar, og það var lygi, að minnsta kosti einn þeirra hefði brotið undir þrýstingi. Þeir vildu hafa játast öllum geithafranum. "Hann sýndi sjálfan sig lifandi eftir ástríðu sína af mörgum óáreiðanlegum sönnunum."<br/>verið að sjá þá í fjörutíu daga og tala við þá um það sem tengist ríki Guðs (lög 1:3):<br/>Stundum meinum við lærisveinana vegna spurningar þeirra um upphaf Guðsríkis. Hafa ber í huga að Guðs ríki var uppáhalds þegnar Jesú Krists. Hann var alltaf að tala um ríki Guðs og það er mikil von að Hann væri að gróðursetja í hjörtu allra manna. Heimurinn er ekki að fara að eilífu undir valdi myrkursins, undir ánauð hins illa. Guð er að fara til eins dags að stofna ríki Hans á jörðinni. Jesús mun ríkja þar sem sólin skín og ríki hans mun ná frá landi til fjöru.“ Og þessi dagur mun vera hinn dýrlegasti dagur heimsins hefur nokkru sinni séð, eins og sjúkur og þjáningar og sársauki verður afnumið í ríki Hans. Eins og synd og græðgi og þetta sem hefur gert heiminn svo ótvíræðan staður verður afnuminn í ríki Hans. Guðlaus miskunnsemi, misnotkun mannsins, allt þetta sem af honum er afbrotið í dýrðarríki Hans þegar Hann ríkir. Engir furðar að lærisveinarnir hafi áhyggjur af því. Ég er spenntur fyrir því að fá það á. Ég er áhyggjufullur fyrir ríki Hans að koma. Og Jesús sagði okkur hvenær sem vér biðjum, þá er fyrsta bæn þín: "Þinn ríki er kominn á jörðu, eins og það er á himnum " (Matt 6:10). Þetta er rétt eins og við eigum öll að biðja. Og svo var hann að tala við þá á þessum fjörutíu dögum um ríkið.<br/>Og hann bauð þeim að fara ekki burt frá Jerúsalem, heldur bíða eftir fyrirheiti föðurins, sem segir: Þú hefur heyrt um mig (Postulasagan 1:4).<br/>Hann mælti: "Nú skaltu bíða hér í Jerúsalem þar til þú færð fyrirheitið um föðurinn." Þetta loforð sem hann vísar til er það, að fyrirheitið í Jóel, þar sem Drottinn hefir heitið: "Svo segir Drottinn: Ég mun úthella anda mínum yfir alla holdi, og synir þínir og dætur munu spá, og þú munt dreyma, eldri menn munu sjá sýnir yðar, og yfir þjónum mínum og ambáttum mun ég úthella anda mínum, segir Drottinn minn, — 28-29). Loforð föðurins: dagurinn mun koma þegar Guð ætlar að úthella anda sínum yfir alla menn, allir átrúendurnir. Þeir munu hver og einn fá þann kraft frá Guði.<br/>17 Því að Jóhannes sagði: "Sannlega skírði hann með vatni, en þér munuð skírðir verða með heilögum anda ekki marga daga héðan í frá (lög 1:5).<br/>Hugmyndin um skírnina var sú að uppruni, pítsatilinn, Jóhannes skírði með vatni, kaffærði fólkið í vatni, „þú ert að fara að ganga niður í heilögum anda á skömmum tíma“.<br/>Og er þeir komu saman, spurðu þeir hann: "Herra, ætlar þú á þessum tíma að endurreisa ríkið handa Ísrael?" (Postulasagan 1:6)<br/>Þegar tími er liðinn fyrir uppreisnina er Jesús nú að tala við þá, ekki um ríkið, heldur um kraftinn sem þeir ætla að fá til að fá til þjónustu. Og svo burstar hann undan spurningu þeirra.<br/>Hann sagði við þá: "Ekki er það yðar að vita tíma eða tíðir, sem faðirinn hefur sett í sitt eigið vald (lög 1:7).<br/>Það er ekki fyrir þig að vita það.“ Þeir bjuggu stöðugt í eftirvæntingu um að setja upp ríkið. Á öllum ævi Jesú voru þeir að búast við að Hann fari inn í símanúmerið og koma út sem frelsari heimsins. Og þeir biðu daglega eftir þessum breytingum og komust í veg fyrir að ríkisstjórnir heimsins, stofni ríki Guðs á jörðinni. Og hvenær sem Jesús ætlaði að tala um að fara til Jerúsalem, sneri hann aftur í hendur syndugum manni og krossfestist: "Ó, ó, Drottinn, enginn, þú skilur ríkið, Drottinn! Lát það langt frá þér." Þegar Jesús dó á krossinum voru þeir allir mjög vonsviknir.<br/>Lærisveinarnir tveir á veginum til Emmaus og svo hryggir. "Hvers vegna eruð þið svo sorgbitnir?" "Hvað átt þú við? Þú verður að vera ókunnugur maður hér ef þú veist ekki hvað er að gerast í Jerúsalem." Ó, samfélag við nafn Jesú frá Nasaret... Hann var voldugur og voldugur, andasmurð Guðs var yfir lífi Hans. Vér höfðum vonað, að í honum væri afhending Ísraels, en þeir krossfestu hann. Hann er upprisinn og segir: „Í nokkra daga ætlarðu að fá fyrirheit föðurins.“ „Ó, hvað loforðið um ríkið?“ Þú sérð að það var lögmætar að þeir ættu að spyrja: „Er það Drottinn?“ Allt í einu. Er þér nú kominn að setja þitt ríki?" segir hann. "En eigi er það yðar að vita, að faðir hans hefir skipað eða faðirinn í hans eigin valdi, heldur munt þú fá vald þegar heilagur andi er kominn yfir yður."<br/>Núna hér er gríski forritarinn notaður til að tákna nýtt samband sem þeir voru að hafa með heilögum anda. Í guðspjallinu samkvæmt Jóhannesi 14. kafla, eins og Jesús lofar að senda heilagan anda, sagði hann: "Ég mun ekki láta þig líða vel. Ég mun koma til yðar, og ég mun biðja föðurinn, og hann mun senda yður annan huggara, jafnvel andi sannleikans, sem heimurinn getur ekki fengið vegna þess að hann sér hann hvorki þekkir hann heldur þekkir hann, en þú þekkir hann sjálfan þig, og hann mun vera í yður.“ (Jóhannes 14:17-18). Sama gríska forsetningu sem okkar, aðeins þeir segja það "en" í staðinn fyrir "in." Tvöföld tengsl þar í John: Hann er með þér, en Hann er að fara að búa í þér, en nú sagði Jesús að þú munt fá vald þegar heilagur andi kemur á þig. Gríska forsetningarmiðið, sem þýtt er í mismunandi texta um Nýja testamentið sem „á“ eða „yfir“ eða „ég vil það“, „yfirflæði“.<br/>Í sjöunda kafla fagnaðarerindisins um Jóhannes: „Á efsta degi stóð dagurinn dagurinn þegar Jesús stóð þar á musterisfjalli og kallaði til fólksins: „Ef einhver þyrstir, þá fari hann til mín og drekki. Og sá sem drekkur af því vatni, sem ég gef, af hans innsta, mun gysja af lifandi vatni.“ Jóhannes sagði: „Þetta sagði Hann um andann, sem var ekki enn gefið, sem þeir sem trúa á Hann ættu að fá.“ (Jóhannes 7:37-39) Hvað talaði hann um andann? Það væri eins og straumur lifandi vatns sem streymir út. Ég vil: Þegar andinn yfirtroðnar þig, yfir þér eða yfir þér, eða yfir þér streymir yfir þér. Þannig er sambandið við þig: Hann er með yður áður en þú hefur viðskiptin: Hann er sá sem veldur þér að átta sig á því að þú ert syndari, hann er sá sem bendir á Jesú Krist sem svarið sem hann sannfærir um heim syndarinnar, réttlætis og dóms. Um leið og þú opnar líf þitt og hjarta til Jesú Krists og býður Honum að koma inn, kemur heilagur andi og byrjar að indvelja þig. Hann mun vera í þér. Vitið þér ekki, að þér eruð ekki yðar eigin, þá hafið þér keypt með verði, því vegsamað Guð í líkama yðar og anda yðar, sem eru hans. Og vitið ekki, að líkami yðar er musteri heilags anda, sem í yður er? Vertu ekki fullur af víni, þar sem er umfram, en verið að fyllast eða vera fylltur af andanum (1Co 6:19-20, 5:18). En nú er þetta þriðja samband. Þetta er efling upplifun.<br/>Þér munuð öðlast kraftinn, þegar heilagur andi er kominn yfir yður eða yfir yður, eða þegar það er yfir yður komið, og þér munuð verða vottar mínir (Postulasagan 1:8)<br/>Og svo kraftmikill, til að vera vitni fyrir Jesú Kristi, það er áhugavert að orðið vitni að gríska sé orðið vitni að því hvaðan við fáum orð okkar pístratri, og í grísku er það þýtt píslarvætti. Vitur er sá sem ekki aðeins boðar það sem hann trúir, hann býr það sem hann trúir, og hann trúir svo sterklega, að ef nauðsyn krefur, þá mun hann deyja fyrir það sem hann trúir. Þú getur ekki stöðvað hann, Hann er ekki hræddur við að deyja fyrir það sem hann trúir.<br/>En er Páll var á leið aftur til Jerúsalem og Agabus kom ofan frá Sesareu og tók belti Páls og batt sjálfan sig upp og mælti: "Svo er sá maður, sem á þessa belti, að vera bundinn, þegar hann kemur til Jerúsalem." Þá tók vinir Páls að gráta og sögðu: "Æ, Páll, fara ekki." Og hann mælti: "Hvað ætlar þú að segja við mig? Heldurðu að þú hafir áhyggjur af því að ég deyi." Ég er tilbúinn til að deyja." Vera settur til dauða fyrir trú þína gerði yður ekki píslarvott, því að þú varst bardagamaður, þú varst líflátinn, af því að þú varst vottur, vegna þess að þú trúðir því svo sterkur. Svo það gerði þér ekki vitni, það var aðeins sannað það sem þú varst. Þú varst með vitni allt saman. Ef þú hefðir ekki verið maktus, hefðir þú aldrei farið til dauða þíns; þú varst viðbúinn; þú sagðir: „Hver, sem, bíddu, bíddu, bíða. Haltu áfram, við skulum breyta námskeiði hér. Ég held að ég gæti hafa gert mistök." Þá segir þú: "Jæja, hann var ekki martus, hann var ekki að stela hesti, það sannar aðeins að þú værir. Enginn stela hest nema hann sé hest þjófur. Svo að stela það gerir þig ekki hest þjófur, það sannar aðeins að þér voruð allir saman. Verið aðeins píslarvættur, hvað þú varst vitni, martus. " Og þér munuð verða vitni." Og það er ekki áhugavert að flestir þeirra voru píslarvættir? " Vitnisburður við mig."<br/>Ritarinn átti að vera bæði í Jerúsalem og í allri Júdeu (Postulasagan 1:8),<br/>Það er ekki satt að byrja heima í Jerúsalem og þá á svæðinu í kringum Jerúsalem, Júdeu, og síðan var það að breiða upp til Samaríu. Og þá var að fara út í ystu hluta heimsins, og eins og við skoðum bók laga, munum við sjá þessa mjög framferði; hvernig vitnisburðurinn hófst í Jerúsalem. Við munum fá það í næsta kafla. Og þá munum vér sjá hvernig það fór að breiða út Júdeu, og þá fór Filippus upp til Samaríu og loksins Páll og Barnabas eru kallaðir til endimarka heimshluta. Og þannig breiddist vitnisburðurinn út í gegnum smurninguna og efling heilags anda.<br/>En er hann hafði talað þetta, meðan þeir sáu, þá var hann tekinn upp, og ský tekið hann upp frá sér (Postulasagan 1:9).<br/>Þetta er endanlegt loforð Jesú til lærisveina sinna. Þetta er lokaorð fyrir upphafningu Hans, síðar kom Hann og talaði við Pál og aðra, en áður en hann reis upp, er þetta síðasta orð Hans. Og er hann hafði talað þetta, tóku þeir að horfa á Hann og ský tekið hann upp úr augsýn þeirra.<br/>Og meðan þeir voru að horfa stöðuglega til himins eins og hann fór upp, þá voru tveir menn sem stóðu hjá þeim í hvítum klæðum (Postulasagan 1:10);<br/>Við gerum ráð fyrir að þeir væru englar.<br/>3 Þá sögðuð þér: "Galíleskir menn, hví standið þér upp til himins? Þessi sami Jesús, sem er tekinn frá yður til himins, mun koma eins og þér hafið séð hann til himins (Postulasagan 11).<br/>Þeir sáu Hann þegar hann steig upp til himins og sjá hann, þegar hann kemur aftur, "Sjá, Drottinn kemur með tíu þúsundum heilagra, til að framkvæma dóm á jörðinni" (Júd 1:14-15). Og þá: "Til hans, sem elskaði oss og gaf sjálfan sig fyrir oss og hann, hann sem hefir gjört oss að Guði vorum, konunga og prestum, sem með honum munu ríkja, sjá hann, og sérhvert auga mun sjá hann, og þeir, sem stungu hann, munu hryggjast." Hvert auga mun sjá hann. Vottar Jehóva segja, að hann er þegar kominn, en það var leyndarmál, eins og lærisveinar hans, þeir sem sáu hann, voru aðeins lærisveinar Jehóva vottar hans, sem sáu hann aftur. En Jesús sagði: „Ef þeir segja við þig:,Hann er kominn í leyn og hefur farið í leynt herbergi, þá trúið því ekki (Mt 24:26). Þú þarft því að trúa Jesú eða þeim.<br/>Þetta sama Jesú, sem frá yður er tekinn upp til himins, mun koma á sama hátt og þú hefur séð Hann til himna."<br/>Nú er mjög áhugavert vers í II John, vers lögum 1:7, " Því að margir afvegaleiðendur eru farnir inn í heiminn, sem ekki játa, að Jesús Kristur sé kominn í holdinu." Því að þessi lærisveinn er í nútíðinni og ætti að þýða "að koma í holdinu." Þeir sem afneita því að Jesús Kristur er að koma í holdi. Hvað segir Jóhannes um þá: "Þeir eru svikari og andkristnir. Lítum á sjálfan yður, að vér missum ekki það, sem vér höfum unnið, heldur að við fáum fullt endurgjald, því að hver sem brýtur og er ekki stöðugur í kenningu Krists, hefur ekki Guð. Sá sem er stöðugur í kenningu Krists, hann hefur bæði föðurinn og soninn. Og ef einhver kemur að dyrum þínum (á laugardagsmorgni) og kemur ekki með þessa kenningu, tekur hann ekki heim til þín og býður honum ekki gott. Því að sá sem býður honum gott er hlutskipti illra verka.“ (Jn 1:7-11) Spyrjið þá eina spurningu: „Er Jesús að koma í holdi?“ spyr hann þá ef þeir segja nei, mundu bara hvað Jóhannes varaði þér og hvað Jóhannes sagði þér. Ef einhver játar ekki, að Jesús Kristur er að koma í holdinu, þá minnist þú, þegar hann var með lærisveinunum og sagði: "Gef mér að eta"? Hann svaraði: "Þú veist, andar eta ekki, snerta mig. Svo er það sama Jesús að koma aftur á sama hátt og þeir sáu Hann fara til himins, og ég, því að einn, trúi því að koma sé mjög fljótlega.<br/>Síðan sneru þeir aftur til Jerúsalem frá Olíufjallinu, sem er frá Jerúsalem dagleið hvíldardags, um tveir þriðju hlutar af mílunni. Og er þeir komu inn, fóru þeir upp í loftstofuna, þar sem þeir dvöldust bæði Pétur, Jakob, Jóhannes og Andrés, Filippus, Tómas, Bartólómeus, Matteus, Jakob Alfeusson og Símon vandlætari og Júdas Jakobsson. Og þetta allt varð í einni bæn og bæn ásamt konum og Maríu, móður Jesú og bræðrum hans (Postulasagan 1:12-14).<br/>Þetta er síðasta minnst á María móðir Jesú en á þessum tímapunkti er engin frekari nefnd á henni í samþykktum postulanna eða í bréfunum. Ekkert er minnst á dauða hennar eða af særandi uppstigningu hennar til himins án dauða. Ekkert er nefnt í ritningunni. Það er hljóðlaust.<br/>Bræður hans yrðu líklega til Jakobs og Júdasar og annarra bræðra þeirra sem voru synir Jósefs og Maríu.<br/>Efri herbergið, efra herbergið, eru nokkur sem segja að það sé sama efri herbergið sem Jesús hafði síðustu kvöldmáltíðina með lærisveinum sínum. Og enn eru aðrir sem halda í þessu herbergi í musterinu, þar sem frumkirkjur mætast. Veldu þitt val.<br/>Og á þeim dögum stóð Pétur upp á meðal lærisveinanna og sagði: „Sumar þeirra voru um það bil eitt hundrað og tuttugu menn og bræður, þessi ritning hlýtur að hafa uppfyllt, sem heilagur andi fyrir munn Davíðs talaði fyrir um Júdasar, sem var leiðarvísir til þeirra sem tóku Jesú (15-16).<br/>Þar aftur, Pétur er enn hinn sami særandi, og bíður þeir í bæn og grátbeiðni, og Pétur stendur upp og segir: "Fylg þú, það er ritningin, sem er gáður." Og þú veist að hann er að fara á undan: "Við skulum fara, við skulum kasta hlutum og komast að því hver er að fara að fara að taka Júdas stað." Ég finn að Pétur var aftur í holdinu og kemur í ljós að ófullkominn náttúran var hans. Og ég held að framtíðarsaga kirkjunnar í bók laga bendir þetta út, ég hef áhuga á skilning Péturs á ritningunum, hvernig hann er að vitna frá svo mörgum stöðum í Gamla testamentinu. Peter birtist mjög mikill skilningur á ritningunum Gamla testamentisins sem er punktur í þágu hans.<br/>Athugaðu að Pétur lýsir heilögum anda sem Davíð skrifaði þannig: „All ritningin er gefin af innblásturi Guðs“ (2Ti 3:16). Ekki hluti ritninganna. Ef þú segir mér að hluti ritninganna sé gefinn af innblæstri Guðs, þá verð ég að spyrja þig: „Hvaða hluta eru af innblæstri og hvaða hlutum er ekki innblástur?“ Og þá ert þú sá sem segir mér hvað ég get trúað og hvaða hluti ég get ekki trúað og sú stund sem Guð er ekki lengur yfirvaldið en þú ert yfirvaldið, ég er í vandræðum. Varist þá sem segja: „Rétt er að þú trúir ekki öllum ritningunum.“ Biblían segir: „Allt ritning er gefið af innblástur frá Guði.“ Og hér segir Luke frá því sem Pétur var að segja, að Davíð væri í raun talsmaður heilags anda. Heilagur andi talaði við Júdas.<br/>16 Hann var hjá oss talinn, einn af þeim tólf, er hann hafði fengið hluta þjónustu þessa, en nú keypti þessi maður akur af laununum, og féll fram hjá (Postulasagan 1:17-18),<br/>Hann keypti völlinn, sem Sakaría ellefta kafla lýsir.<br/>og féll fram á bóginn, logar hann sundur í miðju, og allir í kviði hans hljóp út (Postulasagan 1:18).<br/>Það eru þeir sem finna misræmi í ritningunum, því að í einni af fagnaðarerindinu erum við sagt að þegar Júdas kom aftur og reyndi að skila peningunum og þeir sögðu: "Hóp, það er þitt mál, við getum ekki tekið það." Og í musterinu. Hann kastaði því síðan á gólf musterisins og gekk út og hengdi sig. Þar segir Pétur okkur að hann félli á höfuðið og hljóp bara niður. Og það eru þeir sem ímynda sér ósamræmi. Mjög einfalt kom hann upp í tréð til að hengja sig, batt reipið um háls honum og binda hann til limar og stökk. Og afl fallsins tók annaðhvort reip reipið eða höfuðið, og féll hann niður í gilið og sagði það hér.<br/>Það var vitað fyrir alla íbúana í Jerúsalem, að akurinn er kallaður á tungu sinni, Aceldama, það er að segja: Blóðseitur. Því að ritað er í bók Sáls: Lát bústað sinn verða að auðn og enginn búa þar. Og biskupsríkur hans lét aðra taka (Postulasagan 1:19-20).<br/>Í raun og veru er hann að vitna frá tveimur mismunandi Sálm hér. Frá Psa 69:25, setur hann það saman við Psa 109:8. Og setja þessar spádóma um Júdas.<br/>Þess vegna af þessum mönnum (lög 1:21)<br/>Nú er hér þar sem þeir eru að leita að einhverjum til að taka sæti Júdas til að vera postuli, Hér eru þær hæfni sem þeir leita að á þeim tíma.<br/>Fyrir því af þessum mönnum, sem með oss hafa samfleytt öllum þeim tíma, sem Drottinn Jesús hefur þegar inn og út meðal okkar (Postulasagan 1:21),<br/>Nú munast þér margir lærisveina, sem Jesús kaus tíu að vera postular, og orð postulins „sem sendi út“. Eða kaus tólf postulana, svo að hann sendi út þá tólf. Við eigum aðeins ellefu. Við þurfum að fara með Júdas, en við þurfum að vera með okkur allan tímann frá Jesú.<br/>Frá því að hann var skírður af Jóhannesi, allt til dags sem hann var tekinn frá oss, hlýtur hann að vera vottur um hvað?<br/>Þess vegna voru þær kröfur sem þeir voru að leita að. Einhver sem hafði verið um hríð. Frá skírn Jóhannesar til uppstigningar. Og sá sem sá hinn upprisna Drottin og gæti þannig borið þá vitni um upprisuna, er þeir höfðu vitnað um.<br/>Páll postuli sagði síðar um þá staðreynd að hann var postuli og sagði: „Hafið ég ekki séð hinn upprisna?“ Einhver spurði mig: „Eru postular í dag?“ Ég veit það ekki. Ég held ekki að það séu í sama skilningi að þeir voru í Nýja testamentinu. Víst er enginn í dag sem getur borið vitni að upprisunni eins og þeir gerðu.<br/>Þeir skipuðu tveim, Jósef, kallaður Barsabas, sem kallaður var Jústus, og Mattías. Þeir báðu og sögðu: "Þú, Drottinn, sem þekkir hjörtu allra, sýna, hvort þessara tveggja, sem þú hefur valið (Postulasagan 1:23-24),<br/>Ég held að við gerum þetta oft að mistökum að gefa Drottni tvö val, bæði rangt. Að takmarka Guð, þú sérð það. Við erum svo spennt fyrir því. Páll var val Guðs. Pétur var fárástur og stökk af byssunni og mælti: "Víst erum við að gera eitthvað, þú veist, fá hjálp Guðs, þú veist, og við verðum að fylla hann." Og enn, Guð, hver þessara tveggja vill?" Og gefa Guð valinu tvo.<br/>Þannig getur hann tekið þátt í þessari þjónustu og þeirri postula, sem Júdas hafði fyrir afbrotið, að hann skyldi fara heim til sín, og þannig gáfu þeir hlut sinn (Postulasagan 1:25-26);<br/>Og það sem þeir leituðust við að ákvarða vilja Guðs, skulum kasta fíflum, komast að því hvað vilji Guðs er hér. Það er mér áhugavert, hinar ýmsu leiðir sem fólk hefur upp á að skilja vilja Guðs. Nú, á Gamla testamentinu áttu þeir áhugaverða leið til að koma til prestsins, sem leitaði Drottins til þeirra í gegnum Úrím og túmmím, "ljósin og fullkomnun." En hvað þessir Úrím og Túmmi væru, vitum við ekki. Ég er viss um að þeir voru ekki lituðu gleraugun sem Joseph Smith fann með gull töflurnar; töfragleraugun, að þegar þú setur þau á, gætirðu skyndilega lesið stigveldisritunina.<br/>Það eru þeir sem segja að Urim og Thummi væri í raun svartur og hvít steinn sem var borinn í poka á brjósti prestins. Þeir myndu biðja og spyrja Drottin sérstaklega spurninga. Þú minntist þess, að Davíð væri að spyrja Drottin: "Herra, eigum vér að fara í móti Filistum?" svaraði: "Nei, næsta dag skulum vér fara út á móti Filistum?" svaraði hann: "Hvað skulum við fara?" Þeir spurðu þá sérstaka spurningar og vildi Drottinn beina þeim í gegnum Úrím og túmín. Þeir segja að prestur mundi biðja: "Guð leita síðan inn og draga upp eina af steinunum tveimur, ef það var hvít steinninn, þá var það já." Ef það var ekki, þá væri það svartasteinninn sem hann myndi draga út, Sumir segja að við fáum hugtakið svartbolluð frá þessum Urim og Thummi. Reyndar, aftur í upprunalegu það er ekkert atkvæði gegn ákveðnu verkefni eða hugmynd. En á tímum Gamla testamentisins notuðu þeir aðferð til að finna vilja Guðs.<br/>Svo hér eru lærisveinarnir að sækja um það sama og þeir kasta á teningnum til að sjá hver af þeim tveimur sem Guð hafði valið að skipta um Júdas Ískaríot.<br/>hlutur féll á Matthias; hann var talinn með ellefu (Postulasagan 1:26).<br/>Hver í heiminum er Matthias? Enginn mun nokkru sinni fyrr heyra af honum áður eða síðan, það er áhugavert að hitta Matthías og finna út hver hann er og hvað hann gerði. Ég held að frá síðari sögu, það er augljóst að gera ráð fyrir að Guð hafi valið Pál sem postula. Páll lýsir því sjálfur. Nú er þetta í síðasta sinn sem við lesumst af þeim sem leita að því að greina vilja Guðs með því að kasta hlutum eða með tilviljun af neinu.<br/>Ég veit náunga í dag, í leit að vilja Drottins, mun biðja og spyrja Drottin spurninga. Hann mun hafa tíu denara í vasa sínum, og eins og hann er að biðja, hann mun taka typpið með augun lokuð og setja þá niður á borðið, og ef þeir koma allir upp höfuð, það er já. Áhugaverður hlutur, hvert einu sinni í einu, þeir munu allir koma upp höfuð og það er ansi góðar líkur, en við finnum ekkert mynstur eftir að heilagur andi var gefinn. Þegar heilagur andi kom yfir kirkjuna tók heilagur andi að tala við þá og beinir þeim, og heilagur andi sagði: "Aðgreina mig Páli og Barnabasi, þá er ég hefi kallað þá." (Postulasagan 13:2). Og heilagur andi sendi þá út og því fundum við kirkjuna beint við af heilögum anda. Þegar heilagur andi kom, þá var þetta að kasta kausi að finna út vilja Guðs til hliðar.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Útgáfu<br/><br/>Þetta er 1769 King James Version um heilagan biblíu (einnig þekkt sem viðurkenndur útgáfa). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Andstaða Stalíns innan flokksins, þar á meðal Bukharin, Yagoda og Rykov, var hreinsaður í þessum þætti, þar sem Stalín neyddi þá til að játa glæpir við að skipuleggja valdarán og andstæða ríkisins, jafnvel þótt engin sönnun væri til. Gabor T Rittersporn sagði: „Margir fórnarlambanna voru helgaðir reglum Bolsheims.“ Þetta gefur til kynna að Bolsévik hugsjónirnar sem höfðu eitt sinn verið rætur kommúnistaflokksins væru slitnar og tortímdi af púgnum.

Stalín var fær um að safna stuðningi frá fólki með því að nota áróður sinn og fjölmiðla til að hjálpa honum að þróa "trúarsöfnuður persónuleika" og ímynd hetja og hugrakkur leiðtogi.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Ofursellur eru að hverfa í stað þess að negra stjörnukrafta. Ég var á 750 síðasta tímabili með kraft 8 nita og það er mjög erfitt að fara framhjá því, eins og, stjörnukraftar spila mjög ríkjandi hlutverk.Samsvörunin er líka rusl. Þegar ég spila gems grípa (um 600 titla), það eru oft samsvarandi þar sem óvinurinn hefur einn fleiri leikmaður en okkur sem er maxed og það er ekki einu sinni að við höfum vl 9 til að keppa gegn því. Stundum eru jafnvel samsvörunar þar sem óvinurinn er að fullu maxed og ekkert af okkur er. Þetta er ástæðan fyrir því að ég spila ekki brawl stjörnur alvarlega lengur.Það er ekki einu sinni eins og það arent margir leikmenn sem eru ekki að hámarki og í kringum 600 titla.Það er pirrandi.<br/>Breyta: Ég held að supercell ætti að hafa að minnsta kosti grunn kerfi sem tekur meðaltal af skriðum þegar þú setur upp leiki.<br/><br/>Nema titlar benda í raun ekki á færni þína. Þeir benda til þess að liðsmenn sem þú ert settur með. Og ég er fínn með að spila gegn hærri stigum skúffum, en þegar eitt lið er allt stig 10 og hitt lið er það ekki, greinilega það er ójafnvægi.<br/><br/>Ég mæli með því að fá góða vini til að spila með, ég og 2 vinir mínir fékk kraft 1 merkið til að raðast í röð 28 með því að spila gimsteinn grípa með ákveðinni samsetningu allan daginn og við gerðum það án þess að einn af okkur sé maxed með skúffum okkar.<br/><br/>Ég veit hvernig þér finnst ég hafa skúffur í háu gripi og það er erfitt að fara lengra og allt sem ég var að segja við sjálfan mig "Ég vil hafa stjörnukraft" sem þarf að gera jafnvægi við stjörnukraftinn eða gera betri samsvörunarkerfið.<br/><br/>Ég finn þetta. ég er ekki eins góður í leiknum eins og þú, en ég fékk Emz til 500 á vald 1 og samsvörun var hræðilegt. Maxed út leikmenn alls staðar! Og það hjálpaði ekki að meirihluti teymis míns hafði um 5-8k titla... Ég þurfti að grípa til að sýna einskipti á síðustu stundu vegna þess að ég get annað hvort látið óafvitandi leikmenn eða einfaldlega spilað svolítið árásargjarn á réttum tíma. En ég vildi virkilega að það gæti verið svolítið auðveldara fyrir fólk sem vill ýta á brawlers til að virkilega há háþróað svið án þess að hafa lúxus af stjörnu kröftum.<br/><br/>Allth toppa er enn góð án bugða. Curveball var bara hjálp til að slá skotin þín oftar en jafnvel áður en curveball var sleppt, sleppa var mjög sterkur brawlar, svo hann mun vera það sama núna.<br/><br/>Ég samþykki að þeir ættu að hafa þurft að skammast sín en ég held að þeir séu að reyna að halda jafnvægi á bæði Snappy Sniping og Ambush, þar sem þeir eru báðir að sameinast þessari breytingu. Hún var að verða svolítið öflugur, en samt ekki nær-verður<br/><br/>Ég er ekki viss um þetta, en nú þegar Darryl fékk áberandi buff, lítur út fyrir að nýju tölfræðirnar sínar, það lítur út eins og Darryl gæti yfirbugað Bull, þar sem hann getur ekki aðeins gert meiri skaða en Bull, hann mun ekki deyja eins og snemma lengur, þannig að ending þeirra mun vera svipuð án stjörnuafls (þó að endingu Bull er enn betra ef hann hefði Tough Guy). Ekki aðeins það, ofur Darryl er hægt að endurnýja, sem þýðir að Darryl MIGHT getur spilað á áhrifaríkan hátt bæði sem þung og morðingi á sama tíma (áður en hann er mjög þung en góður sem morðingi)<br/><br/>En hann sigraði eftir. Og þú færð grefur með honum í raun og veru, svo im kinda ok með nrri, ég hef jafnvel spilað hann síðan ég fékk hann til 500 (í um það bil 5 mánuðum síðan), svo ekki var mér sama um það hvort annað.<br/><br/>Af hverju gerist Poco/Penny ekki HP nerf, ef þeir eru Marksman/Healer ekki tankur?<br/>Af hverju er ekki tanki Rosa hætt, hósta 70% tjónalækkun?<br/>Af hverju er Tick leyft að hafa hæsta svið og mest frjáls pokémon í allan leikinn?<br/>Af hverju er Leon ekki að fá HP/nudduhlaðborð?<br/><br/>Vera það sem það gæti, það var Bush sem var OP, ekki grunnur Piper.Ég myndi halda því fram að Bush er besta stjarnan vald í leiknum (nú jafnvel meira svo þar sem hlutfall tjóna jókst óbeint fór upp) og stöð Piper var botn-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Það sem Supercell ætti að gera er að snúa bæði taugaþræði, draga úr Bush til 600, og draga úr Snappy sniping til 0,25 þar sem það væri óbeint hlaðborð grunnskemmda.<br/><br/>Já og ég tel að þeir hafi farið svolítið of langt með Rosa, því nú er hún í grundvallaratriðum betri bull nú þegar það kemur að tanki, sem hún hefur verið í smá stund. Nú, Darryl gæti líka verið minni, öflugri bull<br/><br/>Hvers vegna finnst mér hún þurfa að pakka í næstum öllu nema stjarnan hennar, heilsu hennar og hraði gera hana svolítið erfiðara í notkun, því hún getur deyja nokkuð auðveldlega, og það er mjög erfitt fyrir hana að fanga skúffur eins og Crow. Stjarna hennar er dálítið brotin þó... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Sjálfstætt starfandi hluti 1<br/><br/>Þegar þú samþykkir vinnu í hvaða stofnun sem er þarftu að sinna ýmsum störfum samkvæmt kröfum vinnuveitanda þíns og þú gætir fengið fast magn tekna sem laun. Þú gætir rekið litla smásöluverslun, sérsniðna búð, veitingastað, bakarí og sælgæti, snyrtistofu o.s.frv. í þínu stað. Þú gætir stundað viðskipti eða framleiðslu á litlum skala eða veitt þjónustu á verði. Slík efnahagsstarfsemi er þekkt sem sjálfsatvinna.<br/><br/>Merking við sjálfsstarf<br/><br/>Það er nauðsynlegt fyrir lífsviðurværi, faðir okkar, bræður, systur og aðra sem kunna að taka þátt í mismunandi efnahagsstarfsemi þar sem þær afla sér lífsviðurværi þeirra. Þessir einstaklingar eru í atvinnustarfsemi sem er kölluð launa- eða launagreiðandi en það eru margir sem taka þátt í starfi eða einhverri starfsemi sem þeir hefja og stjórna á eigin spýtur. Þeir leggja sitt besta á sig og taka allar tegundir af áhættu til að stunda starfsferil sinn með góðum árangri. Öll vinnan sem við höfum séð lítil matvöruverslun, sérsniðnar verslanir, lækningaverslanir o.s.frv. á okkar stað. Þetta eru í eigu og stjórnað af einstaklingi, með eða án aðstoðarmanna, en ef einstaklingur tekur þátt í efnahagsstarfsemi og stjórnar því að eigin frumkvæði er hann þekktur sem sjálfstætt starfandi.<br/><br/>Markmið<br/><br/>Eftir að hafa lært þetta kennslustund, verður þú að vera fær um að:<br/><br/>Mynd af markmiðum<br/><br/>Mynd af markmiðum<br/><br/>einkenni sjálfsatvinna<br/><br/>Það felur í sér eignarhald og stjórnun á starfsemi einstaklings þó að hann geti nýtt sér aðstoð eins eða tveggja manna til að aðstoða hann.<br/><br/>Ekki er hægt að festa tekjurnar eftir því sem tekjurnar vinna sér inn með því að framleiða eða selja vörur eða veita öðrum þjónustu á verði.<br/><br/>Í sjálfvinnu þarf eigandinn að taka hagnað og bera áhættuna af tapi. Svo, við finnum beina tengingu á milli vinnu og umbunar í sjálfvinnu.<br/><br/>Það krefst einhvers magns af fjárfestingum fjármagns, þó það gæti verið lítið.<br/><br/>Í sjálfvinnu er einstaklingur frjálst að taka ákvarðanir í tengslum við rekstur sinn á arðbæran hátt og fá tækifæri til að stækka viðskipti sín. Það gefur fullkomið frelsi til að vinna sem eigin vilja og innan breytur ríkjandi laga.<br/><br/>Þannig er hægt að skilgreina sjálfstætt starfandi starf sem efnahagsstarfsemi sem getur framkvæmt sitt eigið og getur það falið í sér að framleiða og selja vörur, kaupa og selja vörur eða veita þjónustu fyrir verð. |
