In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR vottun blogg<br/><br/>Dagsetning: 23. júlí 2014<br/><br/>Sjálfvirkur ríkjandi meltingar nýrnasjúkdómur er sjaldgæft safn sjúkdóma sem hafa áhrif á þekktar aðgerðir nýrna.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Félagar gegn Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topics: Breytingar í átt að sjálfbærni Breytingar í átt að sjálfbærni<br/><br/>Áhugamál og Locke eru meðal áhrifamestu heimspekinga til að skrifa á ensku. Ástand náttúru, sem á undan skipulagi flókinna samfélaga, er algengt forsenda sem bæði Hobbes og Locke deila en túlkar á mismunandi hátt. Hin fyrri skoðanir manna í sínu náttúrulega ríki sem jafn hættuleg og frjáls til að stunda úrelt markmið þeirra ótilverulegar hugmyndir um réttlæti, sem er ástæðan fyrir því að náttúrulegt ástand hans nemur "stríði hvers manns" (Hobbes76). Hins vegar lítur á menn í upprunalegu ástandi sínu eins og jafn verðmæt og takmarkar náttúrulegt frelsi með hugmyndinni um réttlæti sem krefst ekki að skaða aðra, sem gerir kleift að skilgreina ástand náttúrunnar sem „ gagnkvæma aðstoð og varðveislu“ frekar en stríð (Locke 15). Lykilmunurinn á bókhaldi heimspekinga tveggja er sá að Locke notar siðferðileg sjónarmið en Hobbes ekki og það leiðir að lokum til þess að Hobbes færi á ótakmarkað vald yfir mönnum, en Locke takmarkar stjórnvöld með siðferðilegum meginreglum, sem hann telur náttúrulegt lögmál.<br/><br/>Hobbes byggir á forsendum sínum varðandi eðli þess að allir séu nokkurn veginn jafnir í líkamlegum og andlegum hæfileikum sínum. Hann viðurkennir að sumir einstaklingar geta sýnt meiri líkamlega styrk eða betri greind en krefst þess að "þegar allt er talið saman er munurinn á manni ekki svo veruleg" (Hobbes 74). Þar sem menn eru nokkurn veginn jafnir í getu sinni hafa þeir einnig svipaðar vonir til að ná árangri og fullnægja þörfum þeirra (Hobbes 75). Sem rökrétt niðurstaða þessa jafnréttis, þegar fólkið byrjar að keppa um hindranir, getur enginn fundið fyrir öllu öryggi í eignum sínum. Jafnvel þótt voldugur, svikinn og hæfur maður nái árangri í undirgefni "menn allra manna sem hann getur," tryggir það samt ekki fullkomið öryggi (Hobbes 75). Eins og enginn maður getur fengið slíka yfirburði yfir aðra sem gefur honum algerlega ónæmi fyrir styrk sínum, getur enginn maður fundið fullkomlega öruggt þegar hann er umkringdur jafningjum sínum. Jafnrétti Hobbes í eðli sínu er jafnrétti ótta, þar sem allir menn líta á hver annan sem hættulega keppinauta.<br/><br/>Rétt eins og Hobbes, Locke telur að allir menn séu í grundvallaratriðum jafnir, en úthlutar mjög mismunandi merkingu til hugtaksins. Frá sjónarmiði hans er það ekki jafnrétti getu heldur gildis. Hann lítur á að fólkið "ofsaklega fæddur til allra sömu kostanna" ætti rökrétt að njóta fullkominnar jöfnuðar meðal þeirra, þar sem það er engin ástæða til að íhuga neinn í eðli sínu verðmætari (Locke 8). Eina hugsanlega grunnurinn að því að móta fólk sem er betri en aðrir væri ef Guð „með augljósri yfirlýsingu vilja hans, sett hvert fyrir ofan“ (Locke 8). Vegna þess að slík guðlegur vígsla er fjarverandi ályktar Locke að ekki sé unnt að kalla fram náttúruleg jöfnuð allra fulltrúa mannkynsins. Hobbes nálgast jafnrétti á áhrifaríkan hátt og streitu sem fólk í sínu náttúrulega ríki er jafn hættuleg, en Locke notar siðferðilega nálgun og leggur áherslu á að menn séu jafn verðmætir í augum Guðs. Þessi ágreiningur er aðeins fyrsti munurinn á tveimur höfundum sem byggja á þeirri staðreynd að Locke inniheldur Guð sem forsendu í heimspeki hans, en Hobbes er ekki.<br/><br/>Annar eiginleikinn sem Hobbes býr yfir er túlkun hans á frelsi. Samkvæmt Hobbes gefur náttúran ótakmarkaða frelsi til að gera það sem nauðsynlegt er fyrir tilvist manns. Heimspekingin skilgreinir frelsi sem „án ytri hvata“ í því að nota hæfileika sína til að ná markmiðum sínum (Hobbes 79). Megintilgangurinn með öllum tilraunum er að viðhalda áframhaldandi tilveru sinni. Sem afleiðing af því, Hobbesian frelsi nemur óhindruðu tækifæri til að gera hvað sem er, í dómi manns, væri best til að varðveita líf og eigur hans (Hobbes 79). Eini takmörkunin á frelsi er að einstaklingur getur ekki gert neitt mótefni til að viðhalda lífi sínu eða eyðileggja „til að varðveita það sama“ (Hobbes 79). Burtséð frá því, það eru engin mörk, og allir hafa "rétt á öllu, jafnvel líkama hvers annars" ef það kemst lengra líf (Hobbes 80). Þannig er náttúruleg frelsi, eins og Hobbes lítur á, fjarvistir utanaðkomandi hindrana í að leita réttar síns til að viðhalda og tryggja áframhaldandi tilvist manns.<br/><br/>Locke heldur einnig hugmyndinni um náttúrufrelsi en ekki á óvart að nálgast það á þann hátt sem er verulega frábrugðin Hobbes. Um leið og hann byrjar að ræða frelsi í eðli sínu, bendir hann strax á að ríki frelsis sé ekki sætt „ríki leyfis“ (Locke 9). Sá heimspekinginn bendir á tvær sérstakar takmarkanir til mannfrelsis í eðli sínu. Hinn fyrsti er sá sem Hobbes kynnir: hins vegar frjáls og sjálfstæð, einstaklingur "er ekki frelsi til að eyða sjálfum sér" (Locke 9). En aðrar takmarkanir stangast á við forsetningar Hobbes beint. Samkvæmt Locke hefur sérhver mannlegur skylda til að "skaða öðru í lífi sínu, heilsu, frelsi eða eignum" (9). Líkt og með túlkun sinni á jöfnuði byggir höfundur þessa fullyrðingu á siðferðilegum og trúarlegum forsendum: fólk ætti að varðveita tilvist hvers annars þar sem það eru allar gerðir af sama "óvinigrandi og óendanlega vituri framleiðandi" (Locke 9). Þannig takmarkar frelsi Locke í náttúrulegu ástandi miklu meira en Hobbes með því að kynna skylduna til að forðast að skaða bæði sjálfa sig og aðra.<br/><br/>Munurinn á þessum tveimur höfundum kemur einnig fram í frásögnum sínum af réttlæti í ríki mannkynsins, allt eftir því sem Hobbes hefur áhyggjur af er aðeins mál laganna. Það er engin dómur í eðli sínu og eina lög sem stjórna manneskjum í upprunalegu ástandi þeirra er náttúrulegt lögmál sem aðeins skyldar þá til að leita að persónulegum öryggi. Þar af leiðandi getur ekkert verið óréttmætt í upprunalegu ástandi mannkynsins: "athugaðu rétt og rangt réttlæti og óréttlæti" hafa engan stað og enga merkingu í fjarveru brýna laga (Hobbes 78). Svo lengi sem fólkið notar nánast ótakmarkað frelsi sitt til að keppa við hvert annað um auðlindir, sem þeir eiga rétt á, hafa þeir engin skilyrði til að greina á milli réttlátra og ranglátra aðgerða. Þess vegna skilgreinir Hebreabréfið eðli hugmyndina um réttlæti þar sem höfundurinn túlkar það sem einar starfsemi formgerðar og rótgrónra laga.<br/><br/>Locke úthlutar mismunandi merkingu til réttlætis og skoðana það ekki svo mikið í lögum eins og í siðferðismálum. Þessi grein nefndi þegar að ólíkt Hobbes, Locke notast við siðferðilegar hugmyndir og byggir almennt heimspeki sína á siðferðilegri frekar en eingöngu hagnýtum forsendum. Eðlileg lög læsa, ólíkt því að Hobbes, skyldar menn að gæta sín á hvort öðru frekar en einfaldlega að yfirgefa alla til að verja sig, þar af leiðandi er staður fyrir réttlæti og óréttlæti í eðli sínu. Höfundur bendir á þessa staðreynd þegar hann tekur fram að enginn ætti að svipta annað líf sitt í því skyni að varðveita það "nema það sé rétt á broti" (Locke 9). Þessi yfirlýsing sýnir með fyllstu skýrleika sem samkvæmt Locke, það er réttlæti í ástandi náttúrunnar, og einnig menn þurfa að varðveita það á virkan hátt. Viðmiðun réttlætis, sem lýtur að náttúrulegu frelsi Hobbes, er önnur takmörkun á eðlilegu frelsi sem sett er af Locke: aðgerð er óréttmæta ógn við líf annars og eigu.<br/><br/>Þessi munur á jafnréttis-, frelsis- og réttlætis- eða óréttlætisþróun þeirra á túlkun sinni á sambandi náttúrunnar og stríðsins. Frá sjónarhóli Hobbes eru þessir tveir samheiti, vegna þess að miskunnarlaus samkeppni er eina rökrétt niðurstaða þess að setja fólk með jafngildi getu og svipuðum þörfum í umhverfi með takmörkuðum auðlindum. Hann segir þessa tengingu rétt: "Ef tveir menn vilja það sama, sem þeir geta ekki bæði notið, verða þeir óvinir" og eru því í stríði við hvor aðra (Hobbes 75). En þar sem menn eru fjölmargir og allir búa yfir svipuðum hæfileikum og þörfum, birtist þessi samkeppni ekki aðeins í einstaklingsbundnu samskiptum heldur einnig á þroskastigi í heild. Svo lengi sem allir menn hafa sömu og ótakmarkaðan rétt til allra auðlinda og jafnvel til líkama hvers annars og lífs, er staða náttúrunnar stríð um "hvers manns gegn hverjum manni" (Hobbes 76). Þessi áletrun á rætur sínar að rekja til birtingarmyndar náttúrunnar eins og hún er stjórnað eingöngu af jarðfræðilegum hvötum viðkomandi.<br/><br/>Locke, hins vegar, greina milli ástand náttúrunnar og ástand stríðs og bendir á það, á meðan þeir kunna að eiga sér stað samtímis, það er engin ástæða til að bera kennsl á annað. Loks er skilgreiningin á stríði er nánast eins og Hobbes. Samkvæmt Locke, "Hver reynir að fá annan mann í algjöra vald sitt setur hann sig í ástand stríðs með honum (14). Skýrt er frá þessari skýringu að hver og einn sé allsherjar réttur alls, þar á meðal líkama og líf annarra, leiðir til stríðsástands. En læsa neitar að jafna ástand stríðs og ástand náttúrunnar nákvæmlega vegna þess að hann neitar túlkun Hobbes á náttúrufrelsi. Þar sem náttúrulegt ástand Locke hindrar fólk frá því að skaða hvort annað í gegnum aðra takmörkun frelsis, er tilraun til frelsis annars brot gegn náttúrulegum lögum. Þó að fyrir Hobbes, stríð er ástand mannkynsins sjálfgefið, Lock lýsir það sem per útgáfa af eðli frekar en reglu þess.<br/><br/>Þessi munur á því að afmarka ástandð á náttúrunni og frumefnum þess, svo sem frelsi, jafnrétti, réttlæti og stríð, ryðja brautina fyrir höfunda sem andstæðu á myndum stjórnvalda. Byggt á vísindalegu mati sínu á eðli, höfundur Leviathan ályktar að við aðstæður stríðs, það getur engin ákveðin von fyrir "að lifa út þann tíma sem eðli leyfir mönnum að lifa" (Hobbes 80). Lausnin er að leggja niður allan rétt og yfirgefa alla "svo mikið frelsi gegn öðrum mönnum, eins og hann leyfði öðrum mönnum gegn sjálfum sér" (Hobbes 80). Þátttakendurnir í almannatengslum fjárfesta í ótakmörkuðu frelsi sem þeir hafa safnað upp í fullvalda ríki – sá sem ber æðsta vald í þeim tilgangi að varðveita óbreytta stöðu með því að refsa öllum brotum gegn henni. Yfirstjórn er alger: stjórnandinn hefur vald til að gera allt sem hann þarf" til að stuðla að friði milli þegna hans svo að enginn myndi sigla lífi annars eða eign (113). Hobbes kemst að því að án slíks ósjálfbærsar tölur eiga rétt á að gera eitthvað við viðfangsefnin, það getur verið engin friður og engin trygging fyrir öryggi.<br/><br/>Þó Locke sé sammála nauðsyn þess að búa til pólitískt skipulagð samfélag, andar engu að síður hugmynd Hobbes yfir fullveldi sem ótakmarkaður og ósjálfbærur. Eins og getið er hér að ofan er náttúra Locke ekki nærri eins hræðilegt og Hobbes máluð vegna skyldu fólksins til að varðveita ekki aðeins sjálfa sig heldur einnig hvert annað. Þess vegna kemur þörf á félagslegum samningi ekki frá ótta hinna, heldur frá hreinum þægindum. Lítil samfélög þurfa kannski ekki ýmis lög til að leysa átök og "fulltrúar til að efla ferlið", en stærri samtök finna það ráðlegt að ríkisstjórnir í þeim tilgangi (Locke 57). Þó að vald stjórnvalda geti ekki verið ótakmarkaður vegna þess að það myndi leiða til þess að viðfangsefnin yrðu „ófast, óljós, óljós, handahófskennd vilja annars manns“ (Locke 17). Slík stjórnvöld myndu fela í sér tvíþætt brot á landslögum. Með því að samþykkja algert vald annarra yfir lífi sínu myndi aðili brjóta fyrstu takmörkun sína á að skaða sjálfan sig. Eins og fyrir stjórnandanum myndi frelsi annarra fela í sér bein skaða og, eins og slíkt, vera mótsögn við aðra takmörkun.<br/><br/>Sem bein framhald á máli hans fyrir ótakmarkaða stjórn, Hobbes neitar aðskilnað valds sem meginreglu. Frá sjónarhóli hans, fullveldi, þegar það er tekið til grundvallar, á "í heild valdi að ávísa reglurnar" sem stjórna lífi þegnanna eða, á skemmri tíma, löggjafarvaldið (Hobbes 114). Fullveldi á einnig rétt á því að „heyra og ákveða allar deilur“ – það er að segja dómsvaldið (Hobbes 114). Að lokum, þar sem allt tilgangur fullveldis er að þvinga viðfangsefnin til að skaða hvert annað, getur enginn vafi á því að framkvæmdavaldið er líka sitt einkaforræði. Aðskilnaður valds sem hugtak er framandi fyrir Hobbes vegna skoðana hans á sviði náttúrunnar. Að búa til stjórnmálaflokk þar sem framkvæmda-, löggjafar- og dómsgreinar myndu athuga hvert annað – það er að segja samkeppnina – myndu þýða að endurskapa hættuástand náttúru- og stríðs á hærra stigi. Þar sem fólkið kemur inn í félagslegan samning og stofnun ríkisstjórn til að setja ástand náttúrunnar á bak við þá, ekki endurræst það á öðru formi, að aðskilnaður valdsmáttarandlitsmyndarandlits áhorfs hjá Hobbes beint.<br/><br/>Augljóst er hins vegar að umræða hins vegar að ræða aðskilnað valds sem undirstöðuregla um pólitíska kenningu hans, en mál hans fyrir aðskilnaðinn er augljóst í umfjöllun um mörk löggjafarvaldsins. Eins og Locke setur það, það væri varla ráðlegt "fyrir sömu einstaklinga, sem hafa vald á að gera lög, að hafa einnig í höndum þeirra vald til að framkvæma þá" (76). Heimspekingin bendir á ófullkomleika mannlegs eðlis og eðlislæga löngun til að „grafa vald“ sem skynsemi fyrir þessa varúðarráðstöfun (Locke 76). Rétt eins og í máli Hobbes, er Locke reikningur á aðskilnaði valds stilkar beint frá túlkun sinni á eðli. Ef réttlæti er nú þegar í eðli sínu og fólk getur skilið það, þá eru allir stjórnvöld óhjákvæmilegir háð sömu náttúrulögum. Þar sem algert vald yfir fólki brýtur bæði takmarkanir á þessum lögum, að dreifa og dreifa því er ráðlegt að stjórnvöld vinni með viðeigandi hætti.<br/><br/>Þessi grein hefur sýnt fram á að á meðan munurinn á bókhald Hobbes og Locke er fjöldi mannkyns eru þeir að lokum tilvist siðferðilegra athafna. Hobbes lítur á náttúrulegt ástand sem ótakmarkað frelsi, þar sem fólk bjóst við jöfn getu og ekki bundin af neinum siðferðilegum hugmyndum, svo sem réttlæti, keppi um auðlindirnar af skornum skammti. Þó túlkar jafnrétti og frelsi í raun og veru og skoðanir sem stríð er útgáfa af hinu náttúrulega ríki, þar sem hið náttúrulega lög skyldar menn ekki að skaða hvert annað. Þessi ágreiningur hefur áhrif á nálgun heimspekinga gagnvart stjórnvöldum og krefst allra öflugra stjórnar, eins og ef nauðsyn krefur, getur enginn annar yfirvaldið þvingað mennina til að skaða hvort annað. Að mati Locke væri hins vegar að gefa stjórnvalds ótakmarkaðan vald til þeirrar siðferðilegu takmarkanir sem settar eru í lögmáli náttúrunnar, þess vegna er hann, ólíkt Hobbes, talsmaður aðskilnaðar valds. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Hvað leikur af Thrones kastað upp<br/><br/>kanadíska-franska söngvari Abbas Hasan leggur sig fram við að útsýna allt mannkynið í Fashion Parade 2014.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....

Eins og víða fyrirbæri í jarðvegi breytir vatnsendurnýting jarðvegs vökvavirkni með því að standast vatnsflæðið í jarðveginn. Þar að auki eru vökvaeiginleikar ekki aðeins háðar svitakerfi jarðvegs heldur verða einnig fyrir áhrifum af eðlisefnafræðilegum eiginleikum svitayfirborðs.Í samanburði við vatn hefur etanól ekki áhrif á vatnsfráhrindandi áhrif vegna minni yfirborðsspennu þess. Tilgangurinn með notkun etanóls er að útrýma áhrifum endurnýjunar á vatnsfráhrindandi jarðvegsmælingar, en beita hins vegar hreinu etanóli í náttúrulegt jarðveg getur dregið úr lífrænum efnum og leitt til breytinga á efnislegum eiginleikum. Það getur því verið annar valkostur. Engu að síður, hagkvæmni þess að nota vatnsþétt etanól til að ákvarða fljótandi geymsluferil er enn óþekkt. Þessi rannsókn miðar að því að prófa hagkvæmni vatnskenndra etanóla lausna (0, 10%, 30%, 50% og 100% v/v) til að koma í veg fyrir fljótandi varðveisluferli í litlu magni af beittum grófum sandsýnim með mismunandi vöttum og lífrænum breyttum náttúrulegum jarðvegi (TSL) með sveppamolum, lífkennum, mjólkuráhrifum og brennslu sveitarfélaganna var 15 % af þyngd). Niðurstaðan sýndi að aflögun prófana á vatnsþéttum etanóllausnum miðað við vatn var hraðari um það bil 1 til 3x miðað við fljótandi efni á sama tíma og tíminn fyrir að ná hverjum jafnvægi. Útkoman úr sandtilrauninni bendir til þess að þegar styrkur vatnsþétts etanóls hafi verið undir 50% hafi tapið í gegnum frávik innan við 1% og hlutfallslegur munur á því milli prófunarvökva og vatns var lægri en 10%. Hins vegar voru tapið 11,6% og 24,6% og hlutfallslegur munur var allt um 15% og 30% í 50% og 100% etanóli, í sömu röð. Aftur á móti auka lífrænar breytingar í Templeton en ekki aðeins vatnsvarðveislugetu heldur minnir það líka á uppgufunartap. Losun tapið í TSL jarðvegi og TSL með lífrænar breytingar á jarðvegi voru 1% í lausnum með minna en 50% etanóli.Umfangstap 50% og 100% etanóls var 2,8% og 2,9%, í sömu röð. Hlutfallsmunurinn á vatns- og prófunarvökva var svipaður og í sandtilrauninni þegar prófunarvökvan var undir 50%. Hins vegar var hlutfallslegur munur á 50% og 100% etanóli minni en í sandsýni með um 10% og 15%, í sömu röð. Að auki benti einnig á að næstum allar vatnskenndar etanóllausnir hafi lækkað rúmmálsvökvainnihald á sama þrýstingi miðað við vatn, sem var spegilmynd af vatnsþéttum etanólslausnum sem eyðilögðust hraðar en vatn undir jafnþrýstingi. Þess vegna, 10% til 40% etanóls lausna gæti talist valkostur til að ákvarða eiginleika jarðvegs í vökvaformi vegna hraðari lækkunarhraða þeirra og ekki áhrifum af á vatnsfráhrindandi jarðvegs. Vegna uppgufunar og upplausnar lífræns efnis voru vatnsþéttar etanól lausnir yfir 50% styrk ekki hentugur fyrir grófan sand eða meðalstóran jarðveg. |

| Want to plant tomatoes in June or July along the Southern California Coast but not sure the seasonal timing is right? Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around September 3. The state of California is so large that some of its areas are divided into multiple U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones. Otherwise, you will want to plant tomatoes in the spring, as a crop that matures in late summer to early fall. There is a multitude of varieties, filling out the entire spectrum of color, size, and flavor. Anyway, it's important to remember that the numbers in this fall planting guide are only a starting point for you! But with all the weather weirdness happening in Southern California right now, one has to wonder if it's safe to start tomatoes this month as opposed to early spring. Before planting tomatoes, amend the soil with a mushroom compost or mycorrhizal fertilizer. From seed or transplant, follow these steps for successful tomatoes this season. ZONE 7. Look at this load of tomato beauties! by Farmers' Almanac Staff Updated: November 20, 2020 Home & Garden, Planting Guides. It takes a lot of water (and heating energy) to peel three million pounds of processing toma toes in California each year. California, that time changes if planting that vegetable in northern California. The days are bright and warm enough, and if you're starting tomatoes from seed, you can get a jump-start on the season by planting earlier and harvesting earlier. These problems that plague tomatoes grown in containers can magnify in tropical or subtropical climates, where the humidity is turned up and pests multiply. If you are in Zone 10 (parts of Hawaii, southern California and southern Florida), you can plant tomatoes late as a fall crop. All of the following pertains to full-size tomatoes. Oregon's Rogue River Valley, California's High Foothills Growing season: May to early Oct. Summers are hot and dry; typical winter lows run from 23 degrees to 9 degrees F/-5 degrees to -13 degrees C. The summer-winter contrast suits plants that need dry, hot summers and moist, only moderately cold winters. In the U.S. we ripen them by putting them in a sunny east or west window. Tomatoes can be found in nearly every vegetable garden across the country, and with good reason, as little else compares to the flavor of a home-grown tomato. Remove tomato plant from the nursery pot (even if it is a peat pot). Until fairly recently, this favorite fruit was either imported from growers in Mexico or produced as greenhouse tomatoes in California or Arizona. Beans (Zones 3-10): There are two main kinds of beans found in gardens, bush beans and pole beans. The same tips and methods can be applied to late tomato planting in many hot-summer areas. One of the most helpful but often ignored tips in growing tomatoes is not to plant your tomatoes in the garden too early, waiting until all danger of frost has passed (usually in to May). When to Plant Tomatoes in Sacramento Valley. Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around August 1. Transplants can be set into the ground beginning in about April, but tomatoes are warm weather plants, so planting when the weather is warmer is usually better.
