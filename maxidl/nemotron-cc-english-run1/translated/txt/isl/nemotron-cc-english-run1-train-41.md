| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 nóvember 2015<br/>Birt með Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa er iðjuver sem dafnar í stórbrotnum, suðrænum og suðrænum svæðum um allan heim.Hið mikla er lykilatriði í Doxiderol, fæðubótarefni sem eykur vitrænni virkni. Bacopa var valinn fyrir getu sína til að vernda heilann og auka asetýlklín, líffræðilegur boðberi sem gerir taugakerfinu kleift að gefa upplýsingar.<br/><br/>Þungalyf lýstu fyrst meðferðareiginleika bacopa í 300 f.Kr. Læknarnir tóku upp hæfileika bacopa til að auka greind og minni. Um 2.500 árum síðar staðfestir vaxandi líkami nútímarannsókna vitsmunalegan ávinning af bacopa skráð í Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>Árið 1987 mat vísindamenn á áhrifum bacopa á vitsmunalega virkni barna á skólaaldri. Í fjögurra vikna rannsókn fóru þeir um tóbak í 40 börn sem voru 6 til 8 ára. Vísindamenn bentu á að bacopa aukinni skynjun og minni. Börnin gátu leyst völundarhús æfingar hraðar og meira eftir að hafa fengið bacopa. Margir foreldrar á Indlandi nota reglulega bacopa til að auka vitsmunalega þroska barna sinna.<br/><br/>12 vikna rannsókn sem birt var í ágúst 2001 kannaði áhrif bacopa um vitræna virkni. Vísindamenn gerðu af handahófi ráð fyrir heilbrigðum sjálfboðaliðum, 18 til 65 ára, til að taka á móti bacopa eða óvirku efni. Þeir notuðu einnig tvíblinda stillingu fyrir rannsóknina til að fela auðkenni vörunnar. Vísindamenn nota þessa hönnun til að tryggja að niðurstöður prófsins séu gildar vegna þess að það útilokar hlutdrægi rannsakenda og þátttakenda. Bacopa hópurinn upplifði verulegar umbætur á þeim hraða sem þeir gátu unnið úr sjónrænum upplýsingum. Þátttakendur lærðu líka hraðar og geymdu nýjar minningar með skilvirkari hætti.<br/><br/>Árið 2007 leiddi Texas A & M rannsóknarháskóli í ljós eitt af aðferðunum sem ber ábyrgð á getu bacopa til að stuðla að heilaheilbrigði. Samkvæmt vísindamönnunum notar bacopa fjölfenól til að koma í veg fyrir oxunarálag og skaða sem það veldur heilbrigðum heilafrum. Bacopa dregur einnig úr skaðlegum innstæðum sem eru þekktar sem beta-amýlóíð, sem er aðalþátturinn í álfunni sjúklinga með Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Í júlí 2008 kom út tvíblind rannsókn sem kom út í tímaritinu Alternative and Complejo Medicine sem metur áhrif bacopa á eldri sjúklinga. Rannsóknin staðfesti að bacopa jókst vitrænan árangur en dregur úr streitu. Samkvæmt höfundum staðfesta ávinninginn í þessari rannsókn niðurstöður fyrri rannsókna.<br/><br/>90 daga rannsókn sem birt var í desember 2008 sýnir fram á styrk sem áður var kynnt í öðrum bacoa námi. Bacopa bætti verulega getu þátttakenda til að geyma og nota upplýsingar sem nauðsynlegar eru til að ljúka flóknu verkefni.Bacopa minnkaði þann tíma sem þörf er á til að vinna úr sjónrænum upplýsingum.<br/><br/>Til viðbótar við að bæta taugamerkjaflutning segja vísindamenn að bacopa eykur vitræna virkni með því að draga úr kvíða. Fjölmargar rannsóknir benda til þess að kvíðinn hafi áhrif á verkefni sem krefjast aukinnar aðlögunar, s.s. náms- og minninga. Streita truflar líffræðilegir sendimenn og heilbrigða taugaboð.

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there! I absolutely adore the idea of these two spending quality bff time together doing the small but fun things Elsa never experienced as a child.

Það var hljóð af fjarlægri minningu, rödd sem hún hafði byrjað að gleyma en örvæntingu að klífast við allt það sama. Það var rödd móður hennar sem snerist í sorgarprýði dóttur hennar. Eftir það minntist hún þá mjög á daginn sem hún hafði í morgunmat og það síðasta sem hún hafði sagt við móður sína. Það hékk, þessar minningar, vegna þess að það var eins og einhver annar tími sem hún hafði skipt á milli heimsins, hún hafði vaknað, hlustað, vegna þess að hún hafði engan tilgang utan skóla. Hún gat fundið vinnu og var áætlað í viðtal þennan dag. Hjarta hennar hafði ekki verið í henni, en það var það sem hún þurfti að gera.<br/><br/>Hún minntist á að fá sér drauminn, sjúga hann og gefa sér pep talað um að hún gæti gert þetta, að hún gæti þroskast í lífinu að hún hefði átt að venjast því sem áður hafði verið gert. Auðvitað hafði hún þrálátari tilfinningu að hún ætti ekki lengur heima á sínum tíma eða eigin lífi. Ekki með allt sem hún hafði skilið eftir.<br/><br/>Kagome minntist á tilfinningu trésins fyrir fingur hennar, hvernig hönd hennar hafði krabbað inn í handfangið til að renna hurðinni opnum. Hún minntist þess að hún héldi móður sinni með skærri og líflegu brosi þegar hún hristi sig af stað. Hún man hversu sterk rödd hún hljóðaði, brosið á vör móður sinnar eins og augu hennar skein með stolti. Móðir hennar bað kveðju sína, sem virtist ekki öðruvísi en áður, en nokkuð þyngd orðanna sem byggðu á herðum Kagome, endurspeglaði hún meira.<br/><br/>Í stuttu máli, hugsanirnar hörfuðu fram og hugsaði með sér hvort móðir hennar hafi áhyggjur af henni, misst af henni eins og hún gerði. Kagome gat opinberlega viðurkennt að styrkur móður hennar, stuðning hennar við það að dóttir hennar hafi þrútið í gegnum tímann svo oft. Það voru tímar þegar hún hélt sig veikur fyrir að hafa ekki konuna til að halla sér.<br/><br/>Hún minntist hins vegar á að hún hefði náð betri styrk en hún minntist á breytinguna í loftinu, hitastigið sem hún hafði gert ráð fyrir, en þrátt fyrir það sem hún hafði átt von á. Það var ekki helgidómur hennar, og þegar hún sneri að fara aftur, til að renna í gegnum dyrnar hún hafði komið í gegnum, hitti hún ókunnu og köldu málmi undir fingur hennar og innan sem var ekki inngang hússins hennar. Maður stóð frammi fyrir henni, á bak við borðið, sem starði á augun á henni sem breiðan hátt.<br/><br/>Hún hafði ekki róið, að minnsta kosti. Að vera rifinn í gegnum tíma og sett í ómögulegt aðstæður að minnsta kosti byggja upp vilja þinn eins langt og undarlegt átti að gerast. Vegna þess að það var ekki á hverjum degi að einhver fann sig drepin í fortíðina með illu anda, áformaði að rífa öflugan gimstein frá líkama sínum að þeir vissu ekki einu sinni þar. Og þá var sú staðreynd að hún hafði sagt kraftmikla gimsteinn inn í hver veit hversu mörg verk og var unnin á að finna þau. Slíkt var ekki eðlilegt og þurfti hún að fara upp og rúlla með það þegar hún gerði sér grein fyrir því að hún var veruleiki hennar. Það hafði virtist svo einfalt, bara safna sards og laga gimsteininn.<br/><br/>En það hafði ekki verið auðvelt, það voru margir illir andar eftir þræðina og skartgripina sjálfa, og eitt sérstaklega öflugt andvarp með ósk um að hann væri staðráðinn í að sjá uppfyllt. Í dag hafði hún aldrei kynnst ósk sinni en vissi að hún hafði aldrei fengið neitt þegar hann hafði lokið þessu. Hann hafði eytt svo mörgum mannslífum vegna einskis. Naraku hafði verið erfiðasta fóturinn og sá sem hafði verið miðstöð alls sem farið hafði úrskeiðis í öllu lífi vina sinna.<br/><br/>En það var óútreiknanlegur, það er nauðsynlegt að rúlla með því sem var að gerast og vilja hennar sem hún hafði fengið frá ævintýri hennar sem hún minntist á að koma upp með sögu sem passa í því augnabliki sem ekki virtist of fábrotið eða langt sótt. Hún þurfti að trúa, hún þurfti að lifa.<br/><br/>Eftir það stóð hún frammi fyrir verri en manni í myndavélaverslun. Hún hafði logið í gegnum tennur hennar til að bjarga lífi hennar áður.<br/><br/>Ég var að leita að vinnu.“ Eftir allt saman hafði hún sett út úr húsi sínu með það í huga að sinna vinnuviðtali en kjóllinn hennar myndi minnsta kosti reyna að meta það mikið. Það var eitt af því auðveldara sem hún hafði sagt.<br/><br/>Og af einhverjum ástæðum, að brjálaður maður réð hana.<br/><br/>かご め<br/><br/>Kagomed réðst yfir í rúminu sínu þegar hún ýtti aftur af fjarlægum minningum og neitaði að viðurkenna að hún væri í raun vakandi. Hún skoraði á síðustu augun af svefni og bað hana að snúa aftur og taka aftur í faðm hennar. Hún lokaði augunum sínum og var aðeins fundin með minningum. Fróðleikssöngur söngs í fjarlægð minningar hennar, söng sem hafði oft kvatt hana, gaf sama nafn og hún. Röddin sem sönginn minnir ekki lengur á móður sína heldur á raddir barna sem hún hafði oft leikið sér með að vaxa upp. Þeir kölluðu aftur minningarnar, jafnvel þótt það hefði verið ár síðan hún byrjaði þetta lifandi, jafnvel þótt hún væri hamingjusöm í þessu lífi, var símtalið af þessum minningum of hávær.<br/><br/>Skyndilega var hún að falla aftur inn í þá og sofa hjá henni og hún horfði á sjálfa sig í faðmi fjölskyldunnar sinnar en Inuyasha var dreginn inn í brunninn og leit út eins og hún hafði fundið fyrir. Þær tilfinningar voru enn svo sterkar, tilfinningin um hjarta og sorg þótt hún hefði verið svo löngu síðan hún hafði liðið eins og hún hefði verið rifin burt frá öllu sem henni bar.<br/><br/>Að sjálfsögðu var hún ánægður með að vera í örmum þeirra aftur og hún gat aldrei sagt frá því hvernig henni hafði liðið á þeim dögum. Hún gat samt ekki útskýrt hvernig henni fannst skipt í tvo, með stríðandi löngunum til að vera bæði í fortíð hennar og nútíð. Hún minntist á framtíðartilraunir til að hoppa í gegnum brunninn, fingur kláði á jörðinni í örvæntingu og vinsamlegast leyfðu henni að snúa aftur. Fyrsta mánaðarheimilið, hún svaf ekki svo mikið sem hún hrópaði.<br/><br/>Elysion hafði skapað svipuð viðbrögð, þó að það væri ekki svo grimmt að hún vissi ekki nákvæmlega hvar hún hafði laumast í gegnum né vissir hún hvar hún gæti ormað leið sína til baka. Rannsóknir hennar voru fín á milli starfa sinna og reyna að setjast sig í þetta líf. Hún hafði engar fyrirætlanir um að vera lengur en hún þurfti. Og þó að hún hafi ekki reynt eins harðlega og hún hafði þegar hún reyndi að snúa aftur til fortíðar var ástríða hennar af því að hún hafði engin tengsl við þennan heim. Vegna þess að hún var sannarlega ein...<br/><br/>Hún hélt að Skartgripirnir hefðu rænt bakið og fundið nýja helvíti fyrir hana til að búa í. Nýja helvíti sem myndi þvinga hana til að gera vilja, en hún minntist mjög vel að hún hafði óskað þess að eilífu. Það stöðvaði ekki drauma sína, þá tíma þegar hún vaknaði um nóttina og þær minningar um fortíð hennar voru harðar að takast á við, harðast að gleyma. Hjarta hennar byrjaði að æfa í læti þegar hún sneri aftur í rúmið sitt, andardráttur hennar varð þegar hún barðist gegn lætisárás þar sem hún ráfandi hugur hennar um nóttina.<br/><br/>Hún hataði tilfinninguna svo veikur, svo hræddur.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome tók loksins sig úr rúminu, herbergislit hennar með fölu ljósi sem var nóg til að leiðbeina henni á klósettið. Hún stóð fyrir framan spegilinn, vaskinn sem hún lék við spegilinn. Hrafn litað hár hylur andlit hennar og hún fannst slæmt eins og hún leit út í. Fyrsta morgun hennar í Elysion var svipuð og þetta, aðeins hún var í verri formi.<br/><br/>Hún hafði fundið stað til að sofa, stjórna að vinna út samning við eiganda hússins til að leyfa henni að vera lítill tími án þess að borga. Kannski hafði það verið áhrif Miroku sem leyfði henni að slá slíkar tilboð, þar sem munkurinn var þekktur fyrir leið sína í heillandi (eða svindl) fólki í að gefa þeim meira en nóg fyrir verkið sem þeir höfðu gert. Munkan hafði alltaf verið sú leið, síðan þeir höfðu fyrst hitt, og hann vildi segja herra að þeir væru hékkir þegar það væri ekki eða, halda því fram að þeir væru háðir árás þegar þeir myndu ekki vera, hann myndi selja öfl sín og heilla fyrir svona hátt verð. Það virkaði nánast í hvert skipti og hún velti því fyrir sér hvers vegna fólk hefði verið svo tilbúið að treysta honum.<br/><br/>Kannski var það brosið hans, eða sú staðreynd að hann var munkur að fólk fortíðarinnar væri svo tilbúið að krumpa; Hann var aldrei á veiku, að minnsta kosti. Hann gerði alltaf það sem var rétt og hann var tákn um styrk til hennar á tímum þegar hann myndi ýta í gegnum allt til að gera það sem var rétt. Hann ýtti í gegnum þá staðreynd að hann var að deyja, að hann var bölvaður og reyndi að gera eitthvað um það frekar en að leyfa í örlögum hans, og hann hafði ýtt undir mörkina á þeim tíma sem hann leiddi til lokabaráttu þeirra. Og hún hafði verið fegin að þeir höfðu sigrað Naraku áður en hann gat orðið háð sömu örlög og faðir hans og faðir hans fyrir honum.<br/><br/>Þrátt fyrir að eigin heillar hennar fór hún hins vegar meiri sanngjarnt en vinkona hennar og hélt því fram að einhver í þessum heimi myndi borga mikið verð fyrir exorism eða banasár. Þeir voru of tæknilega háþróaður fyrir það. En hún var nógu snjall og nógu klár til að gera gott.<br/><br/>En nú, Kagome var á betri stað þó að líta á andlit hennar virtist það sama. Haunted, þreyttur, niðurdrein...<br/><br/>Fljótt sjón á veggnum sagði henni að hún gæti reynt að sofa lengur en hún tók það upp og vildi ekki horfast í augu við flasbacks aftur. Hún fór í sturtu í staðinn og notaði kalt vatn til að eltast við djöfla sína, til að fylla lungurnar sínar með mikilli anda og þvinga sig vakandi.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Það virkaði ekki.<br/><br/>Ekki á þann hátt sem hún vildi, kalt vatn þvingaði loftið í lungur hennar, neyddi hugann til að vakna og vöðva til að grípa, beiskur hlæja var dreginn úr vörum sínum eins og hún lýsti höfðinu til baka og fann sig að muna meira. Í dag, hún var ekki að fara að flýja þá svo auðveldlega, hún var ekki að fara að batna svo einfaldlega, til að endurheimta bara vegna þess að hún vildi það.<br/><br/>Stundum er ekkert að forðast þær hugsanir sem þú vildir. Jafnvel þegar þú varst viss um að þú værir framhjá þeim.<br/><br/>Sango hefði verið frábær hjálp í þessum aðstæðum, en illmenni var bestur vinur hennar, hún myndi fara eins langt og að kalla systur sína að hún hefði aldrei átt. Eldri systir, sem var vitur, hafði alltaf átt hlið hennar þegar vandræði stóð upp. Sér í lagi drengur vandræði, þegar slíkt var frekar léttvæg en það var gaman að hafa kremið og vinur hennar til að vera gerður fyrir hana þegar Inuyasha gerði hana sorglegt. Eftir allt saman, það hafði oft verið að hálfi-djöfn myndi hlaupa til hliðar dauða elskhuga síns og brjóta hjarta hennar oftar en einu sinni.<br/><br/>En Sango veitti henni innblástur á annan hátt, eftir að konan hafði staðið frammi fyrir, hafði hún alltaf verið svo sterk... jafnvel á þeim tímum sem hún hafði efasemdir um sjálfa sig, hún dró alltaf í gegn. Hún dáði að því að hún hafði getu til að lifa eftir að hafa misst fjölskyldu sína - áminning um þetta oft ýtt kagome til að lifa af, vegna þess að hún missti alla til þessa heims - og þá hafa bróðir hennar orðið peð af Naraku. Það var ekki auðvelt, hefði ekki getað verið eitthvað að bara einhver gæti staðið frammi fyrir og samt farið áfram með. Hún brosti, jafnvel með þessum sársauka og þeim áminningum... Hún var oft svo björt, jafnvel á myrkari tímum.<br/><br/>Og núna vildi hún halla sér inn í hlið eldri konu, til að taka þægindi í þeirri staðreynd að hún var þar og hún var stutt. Hún fann einhvern veginn að Sango myndi draga í gegnum þetta og bjóða upp á nokkur orð af styrk og skilning. Það var oft eins og þessi sem gerði þessa galdra verri, stöðugt áminning um að hún var án fjölskyldu hennar.<br/><br/>Hún hrópaði hátt í sálu sinni: „Ég vil ekki vera ein.“ Hún hrópaði hár-hljóði í sálu sinni, hljóð sturtu sem drukkin er af hinu góða.<br/><br/>Hún var ekki hrædd við að viðurkenna það.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Önnur stund hafði hún skipt út fyrir að hún hefði áttað sig á því. Húðin hennar var köld úr vatninu og henni fannst eins og ís hljóp í gegnum æðarnar sínar. Hún hafði ekki áttað sig á henni fyrr en hönd hennar náði að slökkva á vatni og enda í sturtu hennar. Kagome leitaði ekki eftir eigin augnastöðu í speglinum aftur, þ.e. vafði hún sig í handklæði og rakti út úr baðherberginu, upp í stigann og inn í eldhúsið hennar. Hún byrjaði á því að gera léttan morgunverð, snyrtilegan lestur í gegnum minnispunkta hennar fyrir daginn sem maturinn eldaður.<br/><br/>Starfsferill hennar var í raun að taka af þessum árum. Myndir hennar voru sýndar í mörgum galleríum, nafn hennar byrjaði að tíða hafa margar varnir fyrir þá sem höfðu áhuga á ljósmyndun.<br/><br/>Starfið sem hún hafði spurt um varnað því allt. Hún hafði verið miklu heppinn en hún hafði gert ráð fyrir því að vera í þessum heimi. Aldrei nógu heppin að renna aftur í sprungurnar í eigin veröld, en heppinn nógu vel til að gera. Þegar hún sneri aftur að eldavélinni, man hún að hún hafði loksins gefið upp aftur heim. Það var um það bil tvö ár inn í líf hennar, þar sem hún byrjaði að fara í ljósmyndun sem meira en bara áhugamál en eitthvað sem hún gæti gert fyrir sig með.<br/><br/>Sá dagur hafði verið sérstaklega ánægður, sólin var hátt á himninum og hún hafði fundið sig að taka myndir af náttúrulegu landslagi. Smá drengur hafði falið í einni af plöntum, og hún hafði náð mynd af andliti sínu hafði sett sig upp í glaðan, hrikalegt grin augnablik áður en hann hafði stökk út til að hefja bráð sína. Það minnti hana á Shippou, litla kitsúpan, sem hún hafði, í raun tekið upp. Hann hafði líka rifið af fjölskyldu sinni þegar þeir höfðu hitt, faðir hans drap og hann var staðráðinn í að hefna hann. Á meðan hann var ungur virtist hann svo þroskaður í fyrstu kynni sínum.<br/><br/>Kannski hafði það verið áhrif Inuyasha sem gerði settinu kleift að starfa eins og krakki aftur, að vera ungur og whimsical á tímum meðan aðrir voru meiri þroskaðir. Hann bauð henni á sinn hátt og hún reyndi að annast hann eins og hún hefði verið svo ungur. En æsku hennar hætti henni ekki að skilja hvernig henni væri sinnt eða umhyggju fyrir honum eins og barnið hennar. Hjarta hennar tók þegar hann brosti, þegar hann hafði verið svo ánægður fyrir gjöf sína af crayons og tók tíma til að búa til list. Hún var svo stolt af því að hann hafði lokið við að hún vissi að þetta væri hvernig móðir myndi líða í slíkri stöðu.<br/><br/>Sá sársauki, sem hafði skorið í gegnum hana, of skyndilega, hún missti hann og vildi sjá hversu mikið hann hafði vaxið síðan hún hafði farið. Hún hafði saknað svo mikið...<br/><br/>Til að losa sig við frekari sársauka, þá vonir hún upp. Og einbeitti sér að því að bæta sig.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Aðeins eftir að hún hafði lokið því að hún hafði gleymt einhverju kryddi eða bragði við matinn. Það var of seint að muna það mikið, þar sem hugur hennar var of upptekinn að muna aðrar upplýsingar um líf hennar sem greinilega hafði orðið mikilvægari en mat hennar.<br/><br/>Farðu á "Sit!"<br/><br/>Það gerðist auðvitað ekkert þegar hún hafði verið reiðaður við einn sérstaklega pirrandi viðskiptavin sem minnti hana á hálfsdjánann. Hann var sérstaklega þrjóskur og dónalegur og vildi mynd taka leið sína frekar en að láta hana vinna eðlilega. Þú gætir reynt að þvinga villt dýr til að haga sér hvernig þú vildir. En sjaldan tókst einhver með valdi. Inuyasha var ekki eins slæmt en Inúyasha hafði lært áður en hún hafði verið neydd frá honum. Hann hafði orðið mildari, meira skilning, meira þroskaðri en það voru tímar sem hann var enn börn og hani.<br/><br/>Hún minnist þess hversu rauð kinnarnir hennar höfðu brennt, en hvernig hún stóð jörð hennar og þeldaði hann, sagði hún honum að vinna fyrir hvern þann sem vildi torvelda sig utan hennar, fyrir utan hennar eigin óskir.<br/><br/>Hún ætti að hafa borið manninn saman við Naraku frekar en Inuyasha. Þó að viðskiptavinurinn hennar hafi ekki svo mikla ásetning. Að minnsta kosti var tilfinningin eftir ánægjulegan minni. Frelsi þess að vita að hún hefði komið hingað til að hún gæti hafnað verki sem hún vildi ekki gera, til að vera eigin manneskja sem var óháð öðrum. Hún gat sagt að hún hafi gert það á þeim tímapunkti. Jafnvel þó að hún heyrði orðdaga síðar með orðum þýddi hún að hún grannti henni.<br/><br/>Hún verja sig réttlátum, eins og hún gerði í lok ferðar sinnar, og eftir allt var hún sú eina sem gat verndað sig í þessum heimi.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morgunljósið tók að skríða inn á heimili sitt og minnir hana aftur á tímann. Aftur taldi hún lista yfir hluti sem hún þurfti að gera og umræðast hvar hún ætti að byrja. Eða, ef hún ætti jafnvel að byrja á. Með því hvernig dagurinn hófst vissi hún ekki hvort hún hefði íhugað að mikil hugmynd væri sú að hún myndi ná árangri með hversu tapað hún var fyrir sig.<br/><br/>Hún vildi ekki klúðra nýjasta verkum sínum, vegna þess að hún hafði gert það á nokkrum sinnum áður, það var ekki gaman að reyna og batna frá heilli hörmung.<br/><br/>Kagome minntist á tilfinninguna fyrir dýru, glænýju, myndavél sem sleppur úr höndum hennar, hún var ekki undirbúin til að styðja hana, því hún hafði bara fjarlægt hana úr töskunni hennar. Hluti af henni öskraði að innan. Frábær, ofur-the-top, fullur af öskra að hún gerði oft þegar hún var mikið, miklu yngri en hún var í erfiðleikum með að gera það í gegnum miðskóla meðan hún hoppaði á milli tíma. Hinn hluti hennar hafði verið frosinn á sínum stað á meðan linsu hennar brotnaði alveg og restin af myndavélinni hafði brotist með henni.<br/><br/>Að sjá bróður Inyusha, fullt andlát, áður en hún var síðasta sem hún bjóst við þegar hún gerði hana leið út fyrir myndirnar sínar. Hann stóð eins stolt og framarlega og að eilífu eins og hún minntist. Hann horfði ekki á allt til að vera í öllum öðrum heimi, þó að hún væri aldrei besta í að lesa hug hans, nafn hans á vörum hennar var svo öflugur, að hún gæti minnst minnstu tilfinningar eins og hún gerði. Varirnar hennar voru narar, munnur hennar var þurr og brjóstmylking kvíða í maga hennar varð sjúkur.<br/><br/>Hún vildi ekki að hún vonast til að vera upp.<br/><br/>En hún vildi að hann væri þar, jafnvel þótt þeir væru ekki vinir, voru bandamenn, ef eitthvað, þar sem þeir höfðu barist hlið við hlið, og eitthvað var betra en algerlega ekkert.<br/><br/>Og Kagóme hafði vit á að kasta sér ekki til hans, að vefja handleggi sínum í kringum sig, sem vissi að hún var ekki ein ein. Myndavél hennar skipti ekki lengur máli þegar hún nálgast hann. Hún minntist þess að ekkert annað skipti fyrir daga þegar hún eyddi tíma með honum, ekki að tala um heiminn heldur talandi (eða, hún var að tala og hann viðurkenndi einfaldlega þá staðreynd).<br/><br/>Þegar hún kom nákvæmlega fyrir hann... gat hún ekki rifjað upp. Það var lúmskur hlutur, rétt eins og hann væri þar, en hún vissi að hún var ekki ein í þeirri staðreynd að hún hafði fallið, þessi tilfinningar höfðu gjörsamlega blómstrað.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Tilfinning um að þyngdarleysi náði henni og skyndilega augu hennar opnaðist meðan hugur hennar kröfðust í örvæntingu fyrir það síðasta sem hún var að gera. Hún minntist ekki á hvenær hún hafði sofnað á sófanum sínum en hún vissi að síðast hafði hún verið á þægilegum púðum. Hún glímdi þó ekki við eða barðist við þyngdarleysið þegar hún var í kunnuglegum örmum. Höfuðið á brjósti Sesshoumaru og tók þægindi í þeirri staðreynd að hann var hér og hún var ekki ein.<br/><br/>Hann tók vel á móti honum. Hann þurfti ekki að tala mikið við hana til að skilja ásetning sitt eða það sem hann þurfti að segja.<br/><br/>Hann kom aftur til rúms síns, settist í hana með auðveldum hætti. Augu hennar hitti augun og hún brosti auðveldlega vegna þess að ekki fleiri minningar rekast aftur, ekki lengur við hana. Nei, þegar hann var nálægt, féll hún aldrei aftur í þessar hugsanir. Hann hafði hjálpað, og árin höfðu hjálpað, og í dag var... Einn þessara daga.<br/><br/>Sofaði.“ Hann bauð honum létt, en hún barðist ekki, því að hún var þreytt, hönd hennar hélt fast á hann, en henni þótti hún vænt um enni hennar við velferð.<br/><br/>Hún segir: "Ég er í lagi," segir hún, "að hún sé í takt við fyrirheit sitt.<br/><br/>Hún var í lagi. Hún var á lífi. Og hún var glaður.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>sendandi<br/><br/>yfirlit<br/><br/>Kagóme, á einum tímapunkti í lífi sínu, var frekar regluleg ung stúlka þar til hún var ráðist af djöfla inni í húsi fjölskyldunnar hennar, og djöfull dró hana niður í brunninn, sem flutti hana í töfrandi um 500 ár inn í fortíðina. Þar lærði hún að heilagur gimsteini var afgirt inni í líkama hennar þar sem hún var endurholdgun prests sem hafði dáið 50 árum áður en hún var dreginn inn. 7 Og gimsteinninn var rifinn úr líkama hennar og illu andanum, sem leiddi hana í gegnum sinn tíma, var sigraður af hálfu hálfs djöfulsins, sem hún hafði fest við tréð. Kagóme naut hálfs djöfla, Inúyasha, í tíma og ferðast með honum til að endurheimta skartgripinn sem hún, sjálf, brotnaði, þótt það væri ekki svo einfalt og auðvelt að gera eins og margir illu andarnir og menn leituðu að skaranum í eigin tilgangi. Hún elskaði ungan morðingja, munkur og djöfull slayer sem allir ferðast með henni til að endurheimta skartgripinn.<br/><br/>Hópurinn hennar var hins vegar ekki sá sem kláraði skartgripinn. Í staðinn var illur hálfvaldur sem rakti flestar stærri viðburði í flestum ævi förunautsins. Þegar hann loksins safnaði öllum skartgripum og gerði ósk sína á tínt hlut, var Kagome dreginn inn í skartgripinn með það að markmiði að gera eigingjarnan vilja til að halda fast inni að eilífu, halda skartgripinum lifandi. Það var þrjóskleiki Inuyasha sem tókst að bjarga henni frá myrkri.Á endanum sneri hún aftur til síns náttúrulega tíma, endaði í menntaskóla eins og búist var við af stúlku á tíma hennar. Hún hefur verið í þessum heimi í fimm ár og hefur löngum verið gefin upp á heimili sitt og hefur komið henni hamingjusamlega í sitt nýja líf.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>Það er frekar auðvelt fyrir Kagome að eignast nýja vini, hún hefur ekki breyst mikið frá æskunni, hún er glað ung kona sem er samúð og velkominn til allra í lífi hennar. Jafnvel sýnir að það er notað til að borða menn, hún hefur verið hrifin af henni og hún breytti leiðum sínum (hún vill hugsa). Þetta er sagt, það er í raun auðvelt að verða vinur hennar eins lengi og einhver er fær um að sýna að þeir eru tilbúnir til að innleysa, eða sýna að þeir eru ekki alveg illt. Hún er mjög fyrir alla sem hún hittir, svo það er erfitt fyrir hana að vera ekki dregin til annarra í löngun til að vera vinir.<br/><br/>andstæðingur<br/><br/>Eina leiðin til að vinna sér inn í reiði Kagoshima er að vera svona sveigjanleg, svo illt og svo langt umfram endurlausnina sem hún getur ekki séð neitt gott í þér. Og hún getur séð góða í öllu og öllu heiðarlega, hver hún hefur staðið frammi fyrir? Hálfur djöfull sem setti tvo elskendur á móti hvor öðrum, sem bölvaðurar allt karlkyns lína af vinum sínum, og þá átti besta vinkona hennar að drepa fjölskyldu sína... Já, ég sé ekki að hata hana neinn án þeirra, raunverulega að vinna fyrir það. Feel frjáls til að gefa það skot, þó.<br/><br/>rómantísk<br/><br/>Þegar þú ert í ást er Kagome sterk stuðningur, alltaf að vera þar jafnvel þegar hlutirnir gætu verið erfiðir. Hins vegar er Kagome ekki að leita að ást, var ekki að leita að ást þegar hún kom svo nokkur fortíðarsambönd eru ekki til. Þetta er ekki að segja að einhver hafi ekki orðið ástfanginn af henni. Hún getur örugglega verið viðfangsefni óskeikulrar ástar einhvers, þó að lokum, Kagome er núna að taka þátt í Sesshoumaru, furðu. Ég er algjörlega opinn fyrir hugsanlegum AU hlutum, þó. <3<br/><br/>fandom í helvíti<br/><br/>aldur forn<br/><br/>tegundir pláss drottning<br/><br/>vinna deyja<br/><br/>kýs að hún/hún<br/><br/>verðlaun<br/><br/>pro hún/her est 62woo ég sjúga á lóð svaraði. en allt í lagi!!!net er mjög vingjarnlegur og hefur það 's flott' persona, hann er virkilega gaman að vera í kring, og hann er SUPER gott að vinna með. eins og hann er frábær sjúklingur og hann mun gera allt sem hún biður hann um er mjög auðvelt að vinna með, örugglega í samanburði við aðrar gerðir. svo ég elska þá hugmynd að þeir séu allir vinnumiðaðir vinir í fyrstu og snúa síðan inn í eitthvað meira. frændi reynir örugglega að umlykja sig með fólki, því að hann elskar að eignast vini, og kagome er ansi mikið tegund hans líka? eins og hún er sæt og hún er sterk kona, og hann er í raun betri vinir með konum en hann er með menn, idk af hverju, hann elskar bara að vera umkringdur kvenkyns vinum sem veit.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Hvers vegna þú ættir að vera á Twitter<br/><br/>Fyrirvari: Ég er ekki, né hef nokkurn tíma haldið fram að vera, félagslegur fjölmiðlar guru. Ég er bara manneskja sem hugsar um efni mikið, og þetta hefur komið upp nokkrum sinnum.<br/><br/>Ég er ekki eins snemma ættleiddur. Stundum tekur mig ár að reikna út hvað ég vil nota eitthvað áður en ég kemst á það og Twitter var einn af þeim hlutum. Ég hef verið á Twitter alvarlega síðan í febrúar á þessu ári, svo ég er alveg ný í því. Samt sem áður hef ég lært ýmislegt, og ég vildi deila þeim, sumir segja að ég er Twitter aumingi, og ég er, vegna þess að það eru margar góðar ástæður til að komast á það, og nánast enginn galli.<br/><br/>Svo hvað er Twitter? Ef þú ert á internetinu hefurðu líklega að minnsta kosti heyrt um það.Það er samfélagsmiðlun sem þjónar sem vettvangur fyrir samtöl, uppfærslur og fréttir á meðal annars en eitthvað eins og Facebook eða LinkedIn. Facebook snýst um hver vill finna þig, en Twitter snýst um hver þú vilt finna. Uppáhalds rithöfundarnir þínir, leikarar, stjórnmálamenn, söngvarar og vísindamenn eru líklega á Twitter.Svo eru uppáhalds persónurnar þínar, útvarpsstöðvar, fréttasíður og verslanir. Og þeir vilja að þú finnur þá og hlusta á það sem þeir hafa að segja. Allir á Twitter, að minnsta kosti vilja tala við þig.<br/><br/>En hvers vegna að vera hluti af því? Það eru alls konar ástæður og ég ætla að gefa þér nokkrar.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter er frábær leið til að komast að atburðum sem eru að fara um allan heim, en einnig í samfélagi þínu. Ef þú ert að ferðast og leita að hlutum til að gera það er frábær leið til að komast að því hvað varðar áhugamál þín (vegna þess að fólkið sem þú fylgir hefur áhuga á). Jafnvel ef þú ert ekki að ferðast, vita um frábæra staði til að fara á staðnum eða vita að fólk sem þú hefur áhuga á að þeir skapar tækifæri til að hitta þá og skapa dýpri samband við þá. Ef þú ferð aftur til veislunnar minnar, allt fólkið í því en tveir, ég heyrði um Twitter og hitti svo í raunveruleikanum, og nú erum við frekar góðir vinir. Og því meira sem þú gerir þetta, því meira muntu komast að því og því fleiri sem þú munt hitta. Og ef þú fylgir þeim á Twitter veist þú nú þegar svolítið um hvað þeir eru eins og. Þeir vilja að þú hið gagnstæða er líka satt, vegna þess að kvala býður fólki að sjá hvað þú ert eins og, og þeir geta gert sömu val um þig.<br/><br/>Innblástur og hvatning<br/>Innblásturinn kemur frá hinum undarlega stöðum og innstreymi kvakanna þýðir að það er alltaf nýtt efni fyrir ímyndunaraflið. Ég hef eftirfarandi fyrstu stefnu, svo ég mun fylgja bara öllum og fara reglulega í gegnum og aftengja fólk. Ég veit ekki hver er að fara að planta fræ af nýju bloggfærslu eða nýju verkefni í mér, svo ég vil halda valkostinum mínum opnum. Hvatning gerist líka, því Twitter er bara eins og lífið. Ef þú umkringir þig við fólk sem er metnaðarfullt, helgað, gjafmildur og erfið vinna er auðveldara að vera þannig og ýta þér. Það er auðveldara að halda að ef þeir geta skipulagt viðburði, opnað verkefni eða bara komið upp á morgnana, vel, svo getur þú.<br/><br/>Ef þú ert að leita að einhverju, eru líkurnar á því að einhver sé á Twitter. Blogger sem er í raun ekki vitlaust. Ofan á það eru fréttaþjónusta og verslanir einnig tengd, sem þýðir að þú getur fengið fréttir þínar upp að mínútu, og fundið út tilboð þegar þær byrja. Eins langt og lífsstíl, að leita að nýjum uppskriftarhugmyndum? Fylgdu nokkrum veitingarum og sjáðu hvað þeir koma upp með. Þarftu að snúa að þessum kokteilparti? Twitter fékk fólk líka meðmæli eða bara að sjá hvað annað fólk er að gera með sitt eigið líf?<br/><br/>Það eru nokkrar algengar áskoranir sem ég glíma við þegar ég tala um þetta og þeir eru lögmætar hindranir.Það getur virst ansi skelfilegar, sérstaklega ef þú ert að fara á vagninn seint, eins og ég gerði. Ég eyddi mánuðum eftir aðeins tvo menn og vissi ekki hvað annað ég á að gera.

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>Þessi hugsun um að fá rótarhringrás setur flesta á brún.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kirkjugarður Neðst Viður<br/><br/>Highgate-verslunarmiðstöðin<br/><br/>Kirkjugarður Neðst Viður, Highgate<br/><br/>Nú heitir Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Frá 1860 til 1880 var miðju rifin úr borginni til að byggja upp fráveitu, járnbrautir og nýjar vegir. Hús voru felld án tillits til leigjendur sem þurftu að finna hvaða húsnæði sem þeir gátu annars staðar. Stjórnendur fóru að búa í Kensington og St. John's Wood, en hinir fátækustu fjölmennustu í eikurnar eins og Seven Dials og Lisson Grove. Fyrir þá sem eru á milli varamenn og þjálfuðu vinnukonur settu sér raðir eftir að hafa farið í einbýlishús og herra Pooter fluttist inn í Holloway. Fólkið Muswell Hill horfði á hús skrið yfir Finsbury Park, upp Crouch Hill og niður hina hlið, þannig að árið 1880, var Crouch End verið þróuð og það virtist engin leið til að stofna flæðið. Tíu árum síðar voru stór ríki Muswell Hill seld. Upton Farm var seldur og þingmennirnir vildu þróa Churchyard Bottom Wood, sem nú heitir Queen's Wood. Tveir hópar heiðarlegs, mjög áhugasamir fólk að berjast fyrir því sem hver hugsun var rétt. Hins vegar trúðu þeir báðir á að gera sitt besta fyrir annað fólk og almenningur reis upp á móti þeim báðum í innvígi.<br/><br/>Á þeim tíma var Muswell Hill Road landvegur, með Southwood Hall í annarri enda og Upton Farm á hinn bóginn.Bur 1894, Onslow Gardens var byggður, Connaught Gardens merktur út og byggingarar voru ætlaðar til að þróa Woodlands búgarðinn. Skera út úr Churchyard Bottom Wood var hópur niður bústaða, á þríhyrningsstað. Óskráð kort, sem aðalstjórnendur Prédikarans, sýnir sex sorp sem opnar milli þeirra - ekki veg sem er úr málmi, heldur leið til jarðarbeiðna. Enn fremur var önnur eyðsla sem leiddi til göngu um skóginn. Þessar tvær opnar voru grundvöllur áætlunarinnar.Sömu tvær eyður og víðs vegar um jörðu, sem sést á þessu svæði árið 1894. Þeir eru sýndir sem " Muswell Hill Cottages" og, alveg í gangi, Peter Sellers var að lifa á sömu síðu miklu síðar. Til að þróa viðinn sem húsnæði þurfti stjórnendur að aka tveimur vegum í gegnum Muswell Hill Road og byggja hús meðfram þeim. Muswell Hill Road framhliðin ein hefði ekki veitt næg hús til að gera ferðamanninn þess virði.<br/><br/>Land og bústaðir höfðu verið gefnir miklu fyrr og voru haldnir fyrir þeirra hönd trúnaðarmenn Horneyjarsýslumanna. Í gegnum 1890 voru bústaðirnir dælt niður eftir þörf stórviðgerðar. Ríkisstjórnir, sem vilja gera það besta fyrir gömlu leigjendum sínum, gátu ekki bætt þá þar sem þeir höfðu enga peninga. Nokkur ár áður en Prédikarinn hafði ætlað að þróa Gravel Pit Wood (nú Highgate tré) sem búseta, en þetta hafði uppfyllt slíka andstöðu sem þeir studdu. Í staðinn gáfu þeir öllum 69 ekrur skóglendi til almennings. Á sama tíma bauð þeir að selja Churchyard Bottom Wood til Hornsey Urban District Council fyrir £ 25,000, en þetta var of mikið fyrir Hornsey að hækka á eigin spýtur. Ráðið sagði að fólk, sem býr utan Hornsey, hafi einnig notið viðar og annarra yfirvalda, ætti að hjálpa en engin hjálp var veitt.<br/><br/>Kort sem sýnir Muswell Hill Cottages sem voru miðpunktur ágreiningsins.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road um 1880<br/><br/>Líklegt er að þessi þrjú pör af bústöðum væru þau í miðju ágreiningsins.<br/><br/>Prédikarinn vildi hækka peninga fyrir kirkjustarf sitt í Bretlandi og erlendis. Þeir töldu að landið hefði verið notað til að mynda trú og ef þetta þýddi að selja af landi eða skógum var það minna illt en takmarkandi vinnu kirkjunnar. Þeir höfðu gefið Gravel Pit Wood að almenningi: á sínum stað myndu þeir þróa kirkjugarðinn Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charity vildi framleiða tekjur til að hjálpa fátækum fólki sínu, svo þeir buðu fram tilboð til stjórnvalda. Þríhyrnt landsvæði þeirra var of óþægilegt mótað til að þróast á efnahagslegan hátt, en ef stjórnendur myndu veita þeim meira land til að gera það inn á fersvæði myndu þeir byggja tuttugu og fimm snyrtilegar villur. Þetta myndi koma með jarðleigum £ 225 á ári, sem hægt væri að nota til að losa fátækt Hornsey fólks.Í staðinn myndu þeir leyfa framkvæmdastjórninni að skera tvo vegi í gegnum land sitt svo að yfirmenn gætu þróað skógana.<br/><br/>Þegar þetta tilboð varð þekkt fólk strax brugðist við viðvörunum.<br/><br/>Þann 16. desember 1893 spurði Carl Williams MP í House of Commons, ef Prédikarinn hafði samþykkt að selja landnám til Hornsey-Karítanna á ástandi sem þegar er til staðar, hvort þetta væri mikilvægt fyrir bygginguna og ef þinghúsið myndi hafa tækifæri til að tjá álit.<br/><br/>Í fyrsta hluta árs svöruðu lögfræðingar herra Levison Gower, formaður kirkjunnar, "Já" við fyrri hluta hennar.<br/><br/>Mr Carvel Williams, "Vit ég að það sé ætlunin að eyðileggja þann hluta af Highgate Woods með því að byggja á því?"<br/><br/>Tveimur dögum síðar birti stjarnan grein sem er verðugt af öllum nútíma tabloid.<br/><br/>Stjarnan<br/>18. desember 1893<br/><br/>Alþingi verður að fylgjast vel með þessum gömlum vandalum og samstarfsmönnum flokksins í Prédikaranum. Þeir eru alltaf að sjá fyrir sér einhver landsvæði eða standa frammi fyrir þeim sem eru á móti almenningi. Stjórnarmenn myndu ekki selja Churchyard Bottom tré til Ratepayers en nú leggja til að opna það með því að klippa tvær leiðir í gegnum það í tengslum við einn af fjölmörgum byggingarkerfum þeirra. Munu einhver ekki spyrja spurninga á Alþingi og athuga múrsteinn og steypuhræra stefnu stjórnvalda?'<br/><br/>Þegar þetta var prentað var spurningin annað hvort ósönn eða grunsamlegt. Önnur greinar tóku upp söguna. Times, í langri skýrslu, sagði fram að framkvæmdastjórnin væri ekki reiðubúin til að gefa fyrirtæki sem Alþingi eða nokkur önnur opinber stofnun, ætti að hafa tækifæri til að íhuga hvaða kerfi sem er til að byggja á trénu.<br/><br/>Í átján mánuði þar til Prédikarinn neyddist til að opna fyrirspurn, sem hófst í Highgate 31. maí 1895, formaður stjórnarandstöðunnar.

Þeirra eigin trúarleiðtogi og umdæmisráð, allt upp í vopn sem sögðu að kirkjan væri of ríkur og ætti að vera góðgerðarmaður, ekki gráðugaður. Þar með var um að ræða tvo prestaflutning. Mundu að þetta var enn á hæð Darwinsbyltingarinnar. Darwin hafði klofið trú á kenningum kirkjunnar og margir myndu hafa rifið vald kirkjunnar frá því sjónarmiði einum saman. Kirkjan var ekki svo örugg eins og hún virtist vera.<br/><br/>Kvöldfréttirnar, 7. júní 1895 sagði:-<br/><br/>Ef Prédikarinn hefur ekki tekist á við í einu, mun ópskringluna fá grip af viði sem mun verða mjög erfitt að losa síðar á, ---.

Það var með mikilli áhyggju að íbúar, fyrir tíu árum, heyrðu að kaupin á Efri trénu hefðu orðið fyrir áhrifum og hversu yndisleg staða þetta hefur sannað, allir sem heimsótt þá geta vitni, en allir sem höfðu sjálfir til að bjarga þessum efri skógum, sem liggja á vesturhlið Muswell Hill, töldu að sigur þeirra var ófullkominn svo lengi sem sextíu ekrur á austurhliðinni var áfram í hættu. Það er, eins og það væri, slys sem trén eru skipt af breiðri háu vegi. Getur einhver vafi á því hvað áhrif myndi vera ef kirkjan er botn Wood væri skipt út af röðum af litlum einbýlishúsum, hver sendi framlag sitt af reyk og sót? Getur einhver efast líka, alvarlega munurinn það myndi gera við fallega uppsetningu keyptra viða ef ný hús væru að renna upp beint yfir á móti laufblaði sínu?<br/><br/>Þetta tjáði skoðanir margra. Í raun, the Grave Pit Wood, sem rithöfundurinn kallar 'Upper Wood' hafði ekki verið keyptur, en gefið hverfi af Prédikaranum, benda þeir til að sleppa tíma og aftur í gegnum árin, en flestir hunsa það. Framkvæmdastjórnin var ekki að fara að gefa frá sér annað timbur hvað sem einhver sagði og hélt þessari stöðu til enda.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, af 5 Cranley Gardens, í bréfi til Times dags. 8. júní 1895, hvött kaup.<br/><br/>Ég veit að það er algengt að tala harkalega frá Prédikaranum en þar sem sjóðir sjóðsins eru skyldugir til að stjórna því mesta kost, og ef allt er gert til að bjarga niðurlægingu trésins, þá virðist mér það vera bara hægt að verða fyrir hendi með því að kaupa fasteignir frá framkvæmdastjórninni, sem ég veit, væri að fullu líf til verndar frjálsra og opin rýmis fyrir fólkið, og mér væri viss um, að það væri búið að meðhöndla málið í frelsi og frjálslyndum anda, þar sem þeir hafa þegar gert í málinu í gegnum Kórónuboltann - lítið fyrirtæki sem ég átti lítið fyrirtæki sem var byggt eingöngu til að tryggja að tryggja að tryggja að tryggja að verða til þess að verða til þess að verða fyrir tennis, svo framvegis.<br/><br/>(Þetta vísar til Crocuch End Play Fields sem hafði verið tryggt nokkrum árum síðar.)<br/><br/>Sem formaður Muswell Hill Conservative Association, er ég stöðugt í sambandi við íbúana, og ég get örugglega staðfest að hver einstaklingur í hverfinu myndi gera neitt með tilliti til verndar.<br/><br/>(Allt sem hann vildi einkar góðgerðartekjur til að styðja við fátæka fólkið sitt. Hann bað um frið lands síns - ekki mikið - hann taldi að viður væri ekki í hættu.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road var einn besti í Hornsey og myndi vera jafn falleg, hús eða engin hús',<br/><br/>(og þá kom hin mikla heiðríka blóm.)<br/><br/>• ‚Er fátækur til að þjást vegna tilfinningalegra anda og líkamlegrar hróps ‘úlfs bara uppvaknar af orðum þínum? Eitthvað verður að gera og það fljótlega. Það væri enginn munur á því að endurhanna góðgerðarbúinu á landinu en hagnaðurinn sem hann fékk frá því myndi verða fátækur og skilið fólk á minnkandi árum sínum og gera okkur kleift að afhenda arfmönnum okkar eignir sem í fjarlægri framtíð væri dýrmætt til þess að veita hinum látnu fátæku í Hornsey.<br/><br/>Lestu bréf sitt eitt skynfæri sem hysteria mjög nálægt yfirborðinu.Hvers vegna hélt hann að stjórnendur vildu byggja upp veginn? Hvers vegna ættu þeir að eyða öllum þeim peningum ef ekki að byggja hús? Hann virtist aldrei átta sig á því að fyrir hektara lands myndi allt tré glatast en hann hafði verið með vandamálinu í langan tíma. Hann var sá sem yfirmenn höfðu gert tilboð um sölu fyrir £ 25,000 árum áður og það er nafn hans sem er heiðraður í reit í Crouch End Clock Tower til að spara viðinn, en traust hans í Prédikaranum Það er sorglegt að á fyrirspurninni var hann að vera kastað eins og djöfullinn.<br/><br/>Fyrirspurnin haldið áfram<br/><br/>Viðsnúningurinn opnaði í Highgate þann 15. júní árið 1895 og þar hafði ráðið breyst alveg. Hefðbundin borðin voru fjarlægð og herbergið fyllt með stólum. Fyrir hálfum liðum sjö var herbergið fjölmennt, með fólki sem vill kasta sér í sæti.<br/><br/>Herra Murray, framkvæmdastjóri, sagði að rannsóknin væri í raun einföld. Hornsey Parochial Charies vildi kaupa stykki af landi aðliggjandi góðgerðareign þeirra á bak. Spurningin var hvort góðgerðarnefnd, sem stjórnaði öllum góðgerðarmönnum, hafði nóg vald til að stöðva þá. Kirkjan var reiðubúinn til að selja landið á mjög hagstæðum kjörum og tekjur góðgerðarins yrðu mjög miklar aukin.<br/><br/>Í gegn þetta voru þrjú stig af mótmæli.<br/><br/>Upprunalega traustið var í þeim tilgangi að bjóða upp á sumarbústaði fyrir Poor, en fjárhirslur voru að leggja til að byggja villur sem væru of dýr fyrir fátækum. Hins vegar var það innan valds trúnaðarmanna að breyta skilmálum traustsins, svo þeir gætu byggt villur ef þeir héldu að hinir myndu njóta á endanum. Fátækt fólk sjálf gæti mótmælt sig en frjálslynd ákvæði höfðu þegar verið lofað fyrir þá. Þriðja mótmælin sem tengjast fagurfræði og opinberri hlið spurningarinnar. Hann tók það frá því sem hann hafði lesið að góðgerðarnefndin ætti að trufla sig til að koma í veg fyrir að Prédikarinn fengi sinn eigin ákvörðun í samskiptum við eigin eign.<br/><br/>Spurningin fjallaði um fín stig, en ræðumenn héldu áfram að koma aftur til helstu vandamála til að koma í veg fyrir eyðingu viðar. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, sem táknar 300.000 manns, gerði formlega mótmæli um hvaða hluta viðarins sem er, svo dýrmætt fyrir fólk í Islington og Hornsey sem er notað í einka tilgangi. Mr Wilfred Hvíta sagði að ef yfirmenn myndu gefa þeim tíma að þeir myndu geta hækkað peningana til að bæta trúnaðarmenn.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont sagði að þeir vildu ekki villur, þeir vildu að bústaðir fyrir fátækum fólk sem var rekinn úr héraðinu. Aðrir sögðu að það væri ekkert fé til að byggja sumarhús til að skipta um núverandi vanskilin en villur yrðu efnahagsleg hlutföll. Aðrir sögðu að það væri stig af villum til að láta í Highgate. Haltu þig við spurninguna um Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher sagði grátan meðal verkamanna að hvergi væri að fara. Vinnandi fólk kom til hans með hrópinn: "Við erum knúin út úr Highgate og erum skylt að fara til Highgate New Town." Ef Muswell Hill Road Frontage var engin spurning en að vegir gæti verið skorið beint í gegnum skóginn í átt að Hornsey, en ef stjórnendur gátu ekki fengið landið frá góðgerðarnefndinni gátu þeir ekki skorið veginn.<br/><br/>Hann var mjög viss um að bústaðirnir gætu verið settir í það sem við á. Hann var spurður af fátækum fólki, af lögreglu og fjölda starfaflokka til að tákna þessi tvö stig, að gisting var mjög nauðsynleg í Highgate og að ef þau leyfði landið einu sinni að selja, þá var engin að segja þar sem hönd byggingamannsins væri kyrr.<br/><br/>(Hátt og langvarandi hressingar).<br/><br/>Fjölmargir aðrir töluðu og mæltu með því að hann tók það að ríkjandi álit væri í hag þess að varðveita bústaðina en fundur ætti ekki að draga ályktanir af því sem hann hafði sagt (Gróans).<br/><br/>Aðrir sögðu að fjárhirslur formennskunnar hefðu mistekist í skyldum sínum með því að láta bústaðina falla í hættu.<br/><br/>Mr H.R. Williams, trúnaðarmaðurinn, sem hafði skrifað til greinarinnar fyrr, sagði að hann hefði það á besta vald að kirkjan myndi gera engar vegir hvað sem er og þeir myndu ekki njóta góðs af aðgerðum formála. Aðrir voru mun minna traust og fundur lokað eftir næstum þrjá tíma.<br/><br/>Við stöndum frammi fyrir þeirri staðreynd að í Highgate og Muswell Hill eru nokkrir einstaklingar sem vilja Churchyard Bottom Wood og vilja ekki vera ánægð fyrr en þeir hafa fengið það - á meðan enginn virðist fús til að eyða langt að borga fyrir það. Allir segja að það væri fínt að hafa viðinn sem opið rými, en allir telja að það sé skylda einhvers annars til að gera það eitt. The Islington Vestry hefur leysast úr 'ersoled' á viðfangsefninu, en Islington Vestry býður ekki upp á eyri stykki til að kaupa. --- Það er ekki erfiðara vandamál fyrir samfélagið eða einstaklinginn að leysa en hvernig á að eignast eign annarra án þess að greiða fyrir það.<br/><br/>Að greiða fyrir það var vissulega vandamálið sem Churchill Bottom Wood varð viðfangsefni öflugra staðbundinna og innlendra umræðu, sameiginlega nefnd til að hækka peninga til að spara viðinn. Þann 20. nóvember 1896 var C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, skrifaði til The Standard, daglegur pappír á þeim tíma, aðlaðandi fyrir hjálp. Hann minnti alla hættuna á að tapa viðinum og sagði að það væri aðeins hægt að spara með því að kaupa það. Ríkisstjórnir kirkjunnar selja fyrir £ 25,000 og auka (5.000 yrði krafist til girðingar og frárennslis, alls £ 30.000.Þetta var of mikið fyrir Hornsey ráðið til að hækka en þeir höfðu þegar kosið £ 10.000 í átt til alls. Skógurinn var ómetanlegt fyrir alla Norður-London svo hann höfðar til opinberra aðila og einkafólks til að hækka £ 20,000 og var hann var varaði við því að núverandi tilboð frá sýslumönnum var aðeins opið til loka ársins 1898. Eftir það myndu byggingasmiðirnir flytjast inn.<br/><br/>Áfrýjandi var fagnað af fjölmiðlum og einkarekinn Bill komst í gegn um þingmálið og varð hann lög sem áttu nú rétt á að auglýsa framlög til þess að kaupa tréð og varðveita það.<br/><br/>Á nokkuð stuttum tíma var nánast allt fé hækkað, en síðustu þúsundir reyndu mjög erfitt að hækka og frest stjórnvalda var spurning um nokkrar vikur í burtu. Herra Cory-Wright skrifaði að flytja í meiri tíma en var veitt aðeins þremur mánuðum og aðeins ef áhugi á 4 prósent var greiddur fyrir aukatímabilið á fullu summan. Í lok London County Council, sem upphaflega hafði boðið £ 2.500, gerði þetta allt að £ 5,000 og heildar var náð, en það var náin hlutur.<br/><br/>Ráðið ákvað að endurnefna tréð sem 'Queen''s Woods' í heiðurs drottningu Victoria's Diamond Jubilee og Hornsey setti á fínu sýningu þar sem hertogi Albany lýsti því yfir að tréð hafi opnað fyrir frjálsa notkun almennings um aldur'.<br/><br/>Þó að herferðin til að bjarga Churchard Bottom Wood var rekin og leikstýrt af staðbundnum fólki sem fannst ástríðufullt um þessa tilteknu tré, kallaði þeir á hjálp og reynslu af stóru neti fólks, sem sumir höfðu unnið saman á svipuðum herferðum í meira en þrjátíu ár. Nefndin gaf út kæru, prentað á mjög góða pappír og ber nokkur fræg nöfn.<br/><br/>Algengar spurningar um opin rými og lýðheilsu voru helstu viðfangsefni sjónarspilsins í viktorískum stíl.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces hreyfingin<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, frábæri endurbætur á húsnæði, sem hafði byrjað með þremur gömlum húsum í Marylebone, keypt fyrir hana af Jolm Ruskin, hafði fljótt orðið sérfræðingur í húsnæði fátækum við erfiðustu aðstæður mögulegt. Leiðin hennar var að kaupa leigueignir og knýja síðan niður sum fjölmennu húsin til að koma ljósi og lofti til hvíla, trúa því að ferskt loft og sólarljósi væri eina leiðin sem fátækur fólk gæti verið bjargað frá "purid hita. Hún hafði lært þetta sem barn frá afa sínum, Southwood Smith, sem þróaði kenningar sínar á Fever Hospital á King's Cross.<br/><br/>Hann hafði byggt fyrstu iðnaðarhúsnæðið fyrir fátæka fólk og hafði sannað tölfræði um að gott loft og ágætis frárennslislif. Gibson Gardens, í Northwold Road, er bein niðurstaða hugmynda Southwood Smith.<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Opin rými og tækifæri til að anda hreint loft, voru nauðsynleg fyrir fólk sem býr í einu eða tveimur fjölmennum herbergjum. Octavia Hill tók gjöld sín af Lisson Grove dálknum, upp breiðstrætinu Fitzjohn's Avenue til Hampstead Heath. Hún elskaði svo vettvanginn sem hún reyndi að kaupa þá sem almenningsgarð. Þeir voru að kosta £ 10.000 og innan þriggja vikna frá því að £8.500 hafði verið hækkaður. Það þurfti aðeins lok sumarhátíðarinnar og aftur frá samúðarfullum vinum og því lengra sem £ 1,500 hefði verið hækkað, en eigendurnir drógu skyndilega boð sitt. Þrátt fyrir allt var farið að mála, voru reitirnir þakinn stórum húsum.<br/><br/>Frá þessu þróuðu herferðina til að bjarga Alþingi Hill, næst opið rými norður frá Lisson Grove, kaupa upp reit á vegi bygginga til að búa til varanlegt leiðslur gegn vaxandi múrsteinum. Herferðin Alþingis var svo vel heppnuð að Hampstead Heath Bill var samþykkt og það voru peningar yfir frá áfrýjuninni. Frá þessum peningum og átökin í átt að opnum rýmum, var að þróa traust ríkisins. Octavia Hill hafði haft áhuga á að vernda svæði eins og Church Bottom Wood í mörg ár, svo hún var náttúrulega bandamaður í baráttunni til að bjarga Wood.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society, var einnig kunnugur þessari tegund af ætlunar- og peningasöfnun. Þeir höfðu rifið niður girðingar þegar höfðingjar mannsins höfðu lokað landi, sem leiddi bæði lög og ólöglega bardaga gegn hrokafullri einkavæðingu lands án endurgjalds. Robert Hunter, heiðursleikari þeirra frá 1868, var alltaf umhugað um að tryggja opin rými, stór eða smá, fyrir almenning. Hann, nú Sir Robert Hunter, varð formaður kirkjunnar Neðst áfrýjunarnefndarinnar. Formaður Samveldisins var hr. Shaw-Levevre MP (síðan Drottinn Eversley) sem lék stóran þátt í þessu og öðrum herferðum í House of Commons. Octavia Hill hafði verið þátttakandi í starfi sínu frá 1875.<br/><br/>Á sama tíma var Octavia Hill herferð fyrir Burials Bill.<br/><br/>Borgarkirkjur voru svo fullir og svo alvarleg hætta á heilsu, með því að menga brunna sem fólk dró drykkjarvatn sitt, var ekki lengur leyft að drekka vatn, heldur voru grafir í útjaðri bæjarins. Aney Park Cemetery var einn af þessum, síðan var hreyfing til að fjarlægja höfuðsteinana á jaðri gamla bæjarins, koma aftur inn í líkamann annars staðar og snúa inn í garða og opna staði, í stað þess að byggja á þeim. Þetta land í miðborg London var mjög dýrmætt og ýkjudýr voru fús til að fá það: Jafnvel Quakers hafði byggt upp yfir einn af móttökum sínum og ógnað að gera það aftur með því að byggja yfir Búnill Fields. Octavia Hill hafði net bandamanna á tugum sviðum, þannig að hjálp hennar til að bjarga kirkjunni Bottom Wood verður að hafa verið ómetanleg.<br/><br/>Metropolitan Gardens Society, sem var sett upp árið 1882, hafði sett upp um tvö hundruð smágarðar í miðborgum árið 1890 og afhenti þeim síðar til sveitarstjórnar.<br/><br/>Kirle-samfélagið gleymist núna en á sínum degi hafði mikil áhrif á bæjarskipulagið og Open Space löggjöf. Samfélagið hafði verið sett upp um 1875 fyrir „Diffusion of Beauty“ til að koma lit og áhuga á líf fólks sem býr í dularbúningi, draga umhverfi. Bjartur litur á veggjum og skraut, góða söng, opna rými, náttúru, bókmenntum og list. Það var skrautlegt útibú fyrir William Morris, sem var í forsvari fyrir kóra og Happy Evening fyrir fólk í skólabyggingum á staðnum; og Bókmenntagrein. Samfélagið höfðaði reglulega með bókstöfum í The Times, til „hið ríkari bekkjarnna“ fyrir bækur og reglulegar til að miðla til drengja og stúlknaklúbba, almshúsa og annars staðar. Nafnið „Kyrle“ kemur frá Manni Ross, heimspekingnum sem gaf fólki sem almenningsgarð. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | áfengisnotkun einstaklinga yngri en 21 ára hefur verið greind sem stórt lýðheilsuvandamál.

| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

Það var ekki pólitísk móttakandi eða opinber afgreiðsla sem leiddi til viðbragða matvæla, heldur grasrótar átak borgaranna sem leiddi til þess að það kæmi í raun og veru í framkvæmd og eftirfylgni með breytingum.<br/><br/>Ég endaði á því að svara einni spurningu: Hvers vegna er svo erfitt fyrir okkur að gera þetta sjálf, sem einstaklingar? Ef allt land getur innleitt og dreift sameiginlegu viðhorfi til matar, af hverju getum við ekki?<br/><br/>Það er ekkert sem er virkilega að stöðva okkur frá því að líkja eftir árangri Danmerkur. Vandamálið er, við erum með svo mörg skilaboð um hvað við ættum að borða og hvernig við ættum að lifa, það er erfitt að vita hvar á að byrja. Svo frekar en að fylgja vel heppnaðum umgjörðum sem sýnt hefur verið fram á að vinna (eins og Nordic Food Manisefto), stökki flestir úr matarkrakki til matarkrakks og reyna að finna „rétta leiðina til að borða“.<br/><br/>En hvernig tókst Claus Meyer?
