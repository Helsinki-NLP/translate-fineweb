| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch í gegnum aldir<br/><br/>Ég var að gera nokkrar fljótandi hluti eins og broomsticks og smitches og hvað ekki og það breyttist í þessa sérkennilegu samantekt á hlutum, þar á meðal Harry niður neðst. Ég er ekki alveg ánægður með hvernig það kom út, en þar sem það er ekki slæmt fyrir seinni Harry Potter aðdáandi-listamynd mína, ákvað ég að lita það samt. Ef þú ert að velta fyrir þér hvar ör hans er, það er það, en það er mjög létt og lítil vegna þess að ég gerði það svolítið á tölvunni. Sketched í penna, litað í Máli. |

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Ef þú fékkst inngöngu og innritaðir -> já Ef þú varst sóttur og sóttur í annað skóla -> já Ef þú tókst viðbótarnámskeið (ekki að hafa þau þar, ég veit UCLA) -> já Ef þú fórst í útskriftarskóla þar -> já<br/><br/>Það er túlkun mín vegna þess að einhver þessara sviðsmynda uppfyllti annað hvort að vera "að taka grunnnám" eða "að taka námskeið" við UC Berkeley.

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Winter Protection fyrir Fig Trees<br/><br/>Tilkynna þessa grein<br/><br/>Winter Protection fyrir Fig Trees<br/><br/>Yfirlit<br/><br/>fíkjutréð hefur verið um allt frá því að minnsta kosti 5.000 f.Kr. og er ræktað um allan heim fyrir ljúffenga ávexti þess.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus forstjóri kemur niður á Mac stuðningi við Rift<br/><br/>Oculus forstjóri, Palmer Luckey, hefur ekki minked orð sín þegar spurt er í viðtal hvort Rfit VR heyrnartólin muni alltaf styðja Mac.Ef þú hefðir einhverjar vonir um að það sé fljótlega gætirðu viljað búa þig undir nokkrar vonbrigði.<br/><br/>Það er undir Apple. Ef þeir gefa út góða tölvu munum við gera það.<br/><br/>Það sem hann vísar til þar í minna diplómatískum skilningi er næði grafík sem þarf til að keyra Rift. Einfaldi sannleikurinn er sú að Apple fer bara ekki í hár-endir grafík sem mun uppfylla kröfur heyrnartólsins. Fyrir samhengi, á Windows PC, þú þarft að lágmarki NVIDIA GTX 970, $ 300 grafík kort.<br/><br/>Eins og Lucky fór á að segja:<br/><br/>Það byggir bara niður á því að Apple forgangsraða ekki hágæða GPS.Þú getur keypt $ 6,000 Mac Pro með toppnum AMD FirePro D700, og það passar enn ekki við ráðlagðar tegundir okkar. Svo ef þeir forgangsraða hærri-endir GPUS eins og þeir voru notaðir í smá tíma aftur á daginn, viljum við gjarnan styðja Mac.En núna, það er bara ekki ein vél þarna úti sem styður það.<br/><br/>Mac Pro getur ekki verið sakaður um að pakka ekki nóg af hestöflum, vegna þess að það gerir, en jafn FirePro myndir eru miðað meira við skapandi markaðinn, rétt eins og Mac Pro. Mac Pro er sérstaklega langt umfram aðrar kröfur vélbúnaðar, en náttúrulega þar sem Rift er grafík þung, þetta er þar sem smáfossinn er. Lucky er kannski svolítið efst, en jafn hann er maðurinn á bak við Rifið, svo það er enginn vafi á því sem hann segir. Jafnvel þótt hann segi það ekki sérstaklega vel.<br/><br/>Hvað segir þú, Mac eigendur heimsins?Ertu jafnvel nenndur um Oculus Rift eða er það eitthvað sem þú gætir haft? Hljómar út í athugasemdum hér fyrir neðan!<br/><br/>Lesið athugasemdir<br/><br/>Oculus forstjóri kemur niður á Mac stuðningi við Rift<br/><br/>Nei, ekki nenni við það þar sem ég var í raun ekki að skipuleggja að kaupa Oculus Rift.Fyrir mig er vöruflokkurinn enn of snemmt og of mikið í beta-kinda áfanga.En hann er að hækka í gildum punkt.Epli ætti að reyna að fá meira á undan pakkanum CPU/GPU vitur. Núna eru þeir alltaf að æfa á bak við.<br/><br/>Afsakaðu mig, en hvað er HTC Vive betri á? Og Oculus Rift styður vissulega Linux vélar sem uppfylla vélbúnaðarforskriftir þeirra! (Útgefið mál er ekki OS en vélbúnaður.)<br/><br/>Einnig, skoðaðu hvers vegna HTC Vive styður OS X: það inniheldur meira af eigin vélbúnaði sínum. (Af hverju það kostar svo mikið.) Oculus lausnirnar - bæði Rift og Samsung gírinn VR - krefjast þess að vélbúnaðurinn sem það tengist til að framkvæma meira af þungri lyftingu.<br/><br/>VR er ekki gimmic. 3D sjónvörp gefa ekki alltaf svona mikið af 3d áhrif, og það virkar ekki við alla. VR vinnur með öllum og Oculus og HTC Vive opinber útgáfa vörur hafa næstum engin áhrif svo það ætti ekki að vera hreyfingarónæmi. Það er líka nóg af leikstuðningi<br/><br/>Augljóslega ef gaming er forgangsröð sem þú ert ekki á markaðnum fyrir Mac, þó.Ekki margir leikur verktaki styðja OSX svo þessar tegundir tækja hafa líklega takmarkaða notkun á Mac (fyrir leiki, engu að síður, sem Rift var hannað fyrir). Að minnsta kosti það er eina ástæðan fyrir því að ég gæti séð mig nota einn. Ég myndi örugglega ekki nota það til að horfa á kvikmyndir.<br/><br/>Apple framkvæmdi Metal vélina í El Capitan, það gæti verið einhver áætlun um að fara inn á leikjamarkaðinn (eins og Apple lærði af iOS hversu stór þessi markaður er, bara að skoða efstu versnandi forritin).<br/>Svo nú er vélbúnaðurinn vantar og leikur djöfla myndi líklega sýna nokkurn áhuga, þar sem Mac það eru nú viðunandi magn af Mac notendur um allan heim.<br/><br/>Mig langar til að sjá Apple leið sína inn í þann geira iðnaðarins. Ég nota ekki Apple vörur sem eru til staðar en þær eru að gera mikið af réttu hreyfingum á mörgum sviðum og ég er mjög áhugasamur.<br/><br/>Auk þess veit ég að stór hluti tölvunnar framleiðir þegar búa til samkeppnina en Apple hefur Rnd vald og reiðufé til að snúa höfuð í raun. Þeir mega ekki vinna fjöldaleiki hvað varðar tegundir, þeir gera í raun sjaldan, en flestir sem gæta að því að gera rannsóknir vita að árangur!= summa hluta tækisins. Apple getur gert meira með "less". Á pappír vörum þeirra birtast óæðri en þegar vandlega jafnvægi vélbúnaður uppfyllir sérstaklega sérhæfðan hugbúnað sem þeir framkvæma bara og samkeppni ef ekki framkvæma.<br/><br/>HA! Ég elska hvernig, allt í einu, að hafa mikil afköst tölvu er ekki mikilvægt fyrir Apple takkar!Það er ekki einn Mac fær um hæstu enda grafík.Getur ekki keypt einn, getur ekki byggt einn. Mac er ekki fær um að vera hæsta í afköstum og þú ert góður með það. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Ég keypti MacBook Pro Retina árið 2012 vegna mikillar upplausnarskjásins og ógreina GPU en fyrir skjáborðið mitt byggði ég kerfi með 4K skjá, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GPX 970 GPU's, og 16 gb af minni allt fyrir minna en ég myndi borga fyrir iMac. Ég er meira að segja með SSD sett upp til að ræsa í OSX.Minn félagi minn er Apple gæti gert svipað atriði ef hann vildi, en lítur ekki á síðustu iMac.Það felur í sér næði grafík og hægan 5400 RPM drif. Tölvan mín gæti ekki litið eins fallega, og það er ekki eins þunn, en á endanum er það gagnlegra - er það ekki hvers vegna við kaupum tölvu í fyrsta sæti?<br/><br/>Ég sé ekki hvers vegna Mac Pro getur ekki notað Oculus það er ekki byggt til að gefa upp myndband. Ég skil að það mun ekki vera hægt að keyra á iMac og vegna þessa Oculus ætti að vera vörumerki fyrir Pro notendur vegna kröfunnar og koma á verðið.<br/><br/>Nú eru menn að segja að tölvan þín er að gera ALLA þungar lyftingar, svo hvers vegna er verðpunkturinn yfir $ 800 fyrir eitthvað sem er ekki að gera neitt?<br/><br/>Ég hlakkar til stefnu VR en ekki þar sem það er í augnablikinu.<br/><br/>Skjárinn þinn (sem Gjafarinn er) gerir aldrei neitt af þungri lyftingu. Það er $ 800 vegna þess hvað skjárinn gerir; 110° áhorfshorn (en ekki mikið lægra en aðrir skjáir) með ofur lágri endingu til að draga úr eða útrýma hreyfisjúkdómi á 1200x1800 fyrir augnskjá fyrir HD gæði.<br/><br/>Og já, Mac er mjög mikið notað fyrir vídeó útboð, en þessi flutningur gerist ekki á 30+ fps. Það getur tekið vídeó útgáfa véla tíma til að gefa eina ramma og stundum ár til að gefa upp heila bíómynd. Lokavörurnar, eða fyrirfram uppgefið efni, er það sem þá verður 30+ fps.<br/><br/>Þakka þér @The RealFixxxer<br/>Mikið af því sem þú segir er skynsamlegt og sumir sem ég var ókunnugt um.<br/><br/>Ég held að ég sé ekki VR sem leik, en eins og morð og að sjá Mac er góður í 3dcad og taka upp myndband sem ég myndi halda að þeir myndu vera fær um að taka saman atriði vel. Ég hef jafnvel séð 3d útgáfa af bíómynd ganga í gegnum. Að búa til 3d veröld og setja myndavélar á svæðum til að reikna út hvernig vettvangur myndi líta<br/><br/>En ég samþykki Mac's frekari notkun CPU hringrás, jafnvel með því að nota það GPU til að hjálpa, þar sem sagt er að það séu aðrar leiðbeiningar sem maður gæti tekið það.<br/><br/>Stór gripið mitt er staðreynd Octulas er litið á sem neytendavara.Ef kröfurnar eru þær miklar, þá er það meiri vara og þarf að auglýsa það. Ég skil að tæknin er til staðar en finn ekki að það sé til staðar til að kalla það neysluvöru.<br/><br/>Já, þú ert rétt. Apple hefur einnig vandamál með hugbúnað. Flestar eru ekki að nota "málm" forritamálið sem hraða vinnslu fyrir leiki vegna þess að það er Apple aðeins lausn þar sem margir nota leikjavélar sem virka á Microsoft Direct X eða opna uppspretta Opengle sem flestir leikir nota til að keyra á Linux og OSX. Opengl er um 20% hægari og stundum miklu meira en það miðað við beina x svo efst á línu spilunarspjaldinu sem keyrir í osSX keyrir eins og miðstig spilakort í gluggum. Svo stór vandamál til að nefna ekki flest macs hafa byggt í kort sem hafa engin uppfærsluhæfni.<br/><br/>Mac pro er svo öðruvísi að Apple þyrfti að gera þetta þar sem það væri ekki þess virði að kortasala að gera þetta þar sem það er enginn hagnaður fyrir þá með lítið magn af mögulegum kaupendum væri fyrir þetta. Apple líkar ekki við að tapa peningum þannig að ég sé ekki þetta alltaf að gerast. Apple myndi tapa peningum sem bjóða upp á vídeó kortauppfærslur fyrir Mac atvinnumenn.<br/><br/>Jæja, hann hefur ákveðið þó að ég sé ekki sama um oculos Rift, frekar bíða eftir stjörnuVR, það ætti að vera valkostur til að bæta við betri GPUS í iMac og MacBook Pro. Það er líka sorglegt að það er ekki meira nVidia kort, mér líkar við CUDA stuðning núna verð ég að kaupa tölvu og setja upp Linux fyrir mín CUDA verkefni.<br/><br/>Gaming er vaxandi markaður og það mun ekki vera langur þar til jafnvel iPhones hafa meiri árangur en Macs.Ég samþykki að Apple ætti að bjóða upp á hágæða GPU í Mac<br/><br/>Ég er mjög hrifinn af skorti á afkastamiklum grafík á Mac tölvum.En toppurinn á borð við iMac notar úreltan farsíma GPU sem að sjálfsögðu er ekki hægt að uppfæra. Ef ég vil þróa hugbúnað fyrir VR, hefur Apple skilið eftir mig ekkert val en að kaupa tölvu til að keyra það á. Sem stór Apple aðdáandi ( já ég viðurkenni það) þetta gerir mig frekar sorglegt.<br/><br/>BTW, VR er ekki einhver að fara framhjá fad. Ef þú hefur prófað það sem ég meina. VR er að fara að breyta gaming og efnissköpun að eilífu.Minn minni áhyggjur af VR er það líka gott. Það gætu verið milljónir manna sem verður háður því að lifa og leika í sýndarheimum. Horfðu á hversu margir fengu háður MMOs sem lék á flatskjá.Með VR líður þér virkilega eins og þú ert í leiknum.<br/><br/>Ekki hafa áhyggjur af neinu, ég er nokkuð viss um að Apple mun hafa eigin framkvæmd sína fyrir Mac og IOS þegar tækni verður tilbúin fyrir neytendur, núna er það meira fyrir harðkjarna notendur. Eins og alltaf epli eins og til að tímasetja sig á réttum tíma, með rétta vöru. Hafa trú á epli.<br/><br/>Það er fyndið að mikið af fólki veit hver v er betur byggt á os stuðning, ég giska á að þið gerðuð þunga prófun og nú er gaurinn í stóru rafrænu versluninni sem veit best.<br/><br/>HTC sagði að það muni koma með stuðning við osx en það þarf samt að sjá.<br/><br/>Ég skil að margir krakkar eru stimplaðir á það d**ks.En skilja að Apple er einbeittari að fartölvum.Og fartölvur er ekki hægt að pakka með meiri orku en tölvu, vegna stærðar, hita, orkunotkunar o.s.frv.<br/><br/>Hann er rétt, jafnvel þótt hann setti það í **** skilmálar. Ég elska Mac minn en Drottinn það þarf uppörvun í grafík. Ekki það þarf að kosta meira en ég væri meira en fús til að borga svolítið aukalega fyrir betri skjákort eða að minnsta kosti hafa möguleika á að setja upp minn eigin. Það er í raun of slæmt að þessi strákur þurfti að gera yfirlýsingu hans hljóð eins og hann er bara venjulegur ómenntaður. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Það sem krakkar sögðu 19<br/><br/>Nei, það er vegna þess að skemmtiframleiðendur og vöruframleiðendur vilja leikara/leikkonur og líkön sem líta út fyrir meirihluta áhorfenda, þannig að þeir séu áreiðanlegri og því skilvirkari sölutæki. Ég er viss um að asískar konur líta frábærlega út fyrir asíska menn. Til mín, eins og hvítur maður, hafa þeir engan áfrýjun.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Ég er 100 prósent beint.Ég fer ekki út úr keppninni.Þegar ég var hermaður hafði ég "ég elska þig lengi" reynslu í Asíu sem hefur yfirgefið mig þegar það eru asískar konur nálægt mér. Stundum verður ég mjög óþægilegur, jafnvel þó að sérstakur einstaklingar hafi gert ekkert til að verðskulda það. Í heimsókn til Tælands komst ég að því að eina leiðin til að koma í veg fyrir að ég væri lögð á götuna var að taka hvíta konu með mér sem huga.<br/><br/>Aha hlutur er að það er ekki margir hvítir menn (eða allir) í Kína, en í "hvíta" stöðum, (eða að minnsta kosti Ástralíu) það eru ansi margir af Asíu þarna, sem gerði mig að hugsa um þessa spurningu...<br/><br/>Kannski í landinu þar sem þú heldur þig við (minna, fuglar föður...), bara eins og til lýðveldis virðist sem flestir eru lýðveldislegir o.s.frv. Þó að það sé aðeins lítil minnihluti sem þú ert umkringdur.<br/><br/>Og eins og ég veit, það eru margar hvítar í Kína, aðallega af viðskiptum o.s.frv. En það er einfalt, flestir eru asískir, svo þeir kjósa asískar stelpur (hundar eins og hundar, kettir, flestir kjósa sína eigin tegund). Og það er ekkert rangt við það. Sama er í hvítu löndum.<br/><br/>Ég held að Asíubúar séu fallegasta. Því miður tókst mér 2 að taka þátt í lífi mínu var ég að nota mig fyrir minn stað/net fyrir löngu og nýlega var hún gulleggur heimskur tík. Hún útskrifaðist aldrei og var 30. Ég væri mjög ánægð ef ég hitti klár sætur asísk kona nálægt mínum aldri sem var ekki gull digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic já vegna þess að þegar maður elskar djúpt hann alltaf gott með þér á rúmið ekkert mál stærð af brjóstum eða lit af húð og alvöru maður virði alltaf stelpu í hvert sambandi eins og móðir, systir, konan, kærastan o.fl.<br/><br/>sem fyrirmynd frá barnæsku fékk ég upphaf minn með fyrirtæki sem heitir sykur og krydd. Ég var ráðinn í Japan meðan fjölskyldan mín var þar.<br/><br/>þú færð vinnu vegna þess að þeir eru að fara fyrir ákveðna útlit, sem eru þeir að miða, og svæðið sem þú býrð í.<br/><br/>Ég þurfti að yfirgefa greinina á síðasta ári vegna heilsuástæða. Ég vann með mörgum tegundum fólks, kóreska, japanska, kínversku, pólsku, þýsku, Ameríku, spænsku, arabísku. Ég hef unnið með börnum, fullorðnum, unglinga öllum þessum þjóðerni.<br/><br/>Ég er hálf hvítur hálf innfæddur amerískur (Lakota) svo þeir elskuðu minn útlit frá unga aldri.En það eru margar fegurðarstaðlar í greininni og ekki allir eru eins og lýst er, sumir eru búnir að líta verra, og sumir ekki taka alvarlega nóg...<br/><br/>Njósnari, það er vegna þess að asískir menn eru afbrýðilegir og ofsafengnir þúsundir afsökunar á hverjum tíma sem hafa asískar konur í fjölmiðlum vegna þess að þeir eru afbrýðilegir af asískum konum, og Bandaríkjamenn vilja halda stöðu hvítra kvenna, þetta er hvers vegna pörin milli Asíu kvenna og hvítra kvenna eru flóknir, það er hvít konur með hvíta karla og hvítar konur með aðrar kynþáttum í Ameríku, þar sem það er kúgun og móðgandi fyrir gó á öðrum kynþáttum kvenna af eigin kynþáttum, en hvítar konur með hvítu konur eru "anti-ra kynþáttar".

Þess vegna sýna asískar konur ekki svo mikið, það er vegna þess að asísku mennirnir verða reiðir, það er vegna þess að hvítu konurnar verða ekki skipt út, og ameríska áróður er um hvítar konur með hvíta karla, hvítar konur með öðrum kynþáttum, hvítar konur í allt.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Eigandi álits<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Allar afsökunar á fjölmiðlum og áróður og allir lygar fyrir kynþáttahatur, afbrýði og hatur eru ekki notaðir gegn hvítum konum af sömu körlum sem finna fyrir afsökunar, hvítar konur í fjölmiðlum, skilja, bandarísk félagsverkfræði er gerð af lýðræðislegum hvítum körlum og asískum konum en það er hræðilegt fyrir nokkra hópa sem eru kynþáttar jafnvel gegn asískum mönnum og afsakanir þeirra, er slæmt fyrir hvíta karla og vinna hörðum höndum að gera parið og hvítar konur sem eru tengdar slæmar hlutum en ekki hvítar konur.
