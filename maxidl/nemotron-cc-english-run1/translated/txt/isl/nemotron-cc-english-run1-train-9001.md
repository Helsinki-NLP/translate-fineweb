| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Til dæmis, VI. ákvæði 2. gr. American Constitution hefur þau ákvæði sem "allar sáttmálar ... skulu vera hin æðsta lög landsins." Þótt það sé augljóst að það hafi ekki sömu áhrif og alríkislög. Í sannleika sagt verða þeir aðeins starfræktir þegar þessi ákvæði koma í gildi sem alríkislögmál með öldungadeildar- og forsetalögum. Þrátt fyrir að þetta sé framkvæmdin er það almennt viðurkennt í alþjóðlegum lögum sem ákveðin sáttmálar hafa bindandi áhrif á lönd. Samningurinn þarf að uppfylla skilyrði þess að vera sjálfstætt starfandi samningur til að hafa áhrif á landið án þess að samsvarandi innanlandslöggjöf sé viðeigandi.<br/><br/>Þetta vekur spurninguna um hvaða sáttmála gildi að „sjálfframleiða“ og hver mun ekki?<br/><br/>Hvort sem um er að ræða sjálfstjórnarvald eða ekki er ákveðið af innlendum dómendum á grundvelli máls (Buergental, 1992). Til þess að skilja þetta mun blaðið fyrst líta á tvær tegundir kenninga eftir löndum um eðli sátta sem gilda um innlend lög. Þessar tvær kenningar eru andstæðar og tvísýndar. Þeir skoða í grundvallaratriðum ramma innlendra og alþjóðlegra laga sem ein stigveldi og tvær aðskildar stighjarr, í sömu röð (Wildhaber, 1971). Lönd sem fylgja monsílandi telja að ákveðin sáttmál séu strax bindandi og hafa strax áhrif á landið. Þegar samningurinn hefur verið staðfestur er hægt að taka þátt í innlendum dómstólum og er talinn vera hluti af lögum landsins. Lönd eftir tvíundanisma telja að samkomulag hafi ekki áhrif á innlend lög þar til það hefur verið styrkt af löggjafarvaldinu. Dæmi um tvíundanisma er hvernig Mannréttindasáttmála Evrópu varð starfrækt í Bretlandi eftir að mannréttindi fóru fram í lögum um mannréttindi 1998 (lög, 2000).<br/><br/>Alþjóðlegt lög er fjölbreytt, og svo eru tegundir starfsferla mismunandi ríkja í kjölfar samþykktar sáttmála. Sumir stjórnarskrár mæla sjálfir verklagið fyrir fullgildingu samnings. Sum lönd hafa jafnvel mismunandi meðferðina sem veitt er alþjóðlegum lögum og venjubundnum alþjóðlegum lögum. Ákveðin alþjóðastofnanir eins og Evrópusambandið hafa oft áhrif á innlend lög aðildarríkjanna. Aðildarríki Evrópusambandsins þurfa að hafa áhrif á ákveðin form samfélagslegrar löggjafar en þó hefur það ómissandi munur á sjálfræði. Munurinn er sá að það er ekki fyrir innlendum dómara að ákveða hvort ákvæðin eru sjálfræði eða ekki, heldur fyrir Evrópudómstólsins að túlka í stjórnarskrársamningnum. Önnur form alþjóðlegra laga sem myndast í gegnum ályktanir eða slík geta þó ekki haft sömu áhrif fyrir þessi ríki. Engu að síður gætu þeir íhugað þau sem „s mjúkur lög“ og litið til þeirra til að túlka ásetning laganna. Stundum hafa tilkynningar frá dómsstofnunum, svo sem Mannréttindadómstóli Íslands, haft áhrif á aðildarríki sín. Þrátt fyrir að þessar yfirlýsingar séu ekki bindandi fyrir aðildarríkin virðast landsdómar vísa til þessara til yfirvalds túlka.<br/><br/>Þess vegna þarf að taka mál til við greiningu á verklaginu og formælum í mismunandi löndum.Til að skoða hugtakið um sjálfræði, þá mun þetta blaðið bera saman áður en mismunandi lög mæla fyrir um lögsögur. Ef lesandinn vill framkvæma svipaða greiningu geta þeir gert það með því að skoða mismunandi innlendar árabækur á alþjóðlegum lögum, að mestu leyti munu þessar árbækur hafa hluta helgað tengsl milli alþjóðlegra og innlendra laga.<br/><br/>International Jurisrupence:<br/><br/>Mikilvægasta vandamálið sem fylgir innlendum dómstólum er hvort sáttmálinn sé sjálfræðisleg? Ef hægt er að beita samningnum án frekari innlends löggjafar sem farið er að styrkja hann. Þessi spurning kom upp í tilviki Czesław S gegn ríkissjóðs og ráðherra ríkisríkisins, þar sem pólska stjórnarskráin hélt því fram að þar sem kveðið var á um að samþykktir landsréttar væru teknar voru ekki sjálfvaldar í eðli sínu (Bug River kröfur, Czesław S gegn ríkissjóði og ráðherra ríkisins, 2003). Í meginatriðum, þegar sáttmálinn vísar til innlendra ráðstafana, skapar það ekki í sjálfu sér nýjar skyldur, heldur styrkir það áform aðilans að innlendu réttarfari að grípa til ráðstafana til þess sama. Dómstóllinn taldi að alþjóðasamningur um borgaraleg og stjórnmálaleg réttindi væri sjálfsafgreiðsluvald í Bandaríkjunum. Í þessu tilviki var dómstóll settur saman um það hvort alþjóðasamning Sameinuðu þjóðanna um borgaraleg og stjórnmálaleg réttindi væru sjálfstæð. Hæstiréttur Bandaríkjanna hefur einnig lýst því yfir að alþjóðasamningur um borgaraleg og stjórnmálaleg réttindi sé ekki sjálfstætt starfandi sáttmáli (dómstóll, 2004). Dómstóllinn í Sviss skoðaði einnig sjálfsstjórn alþjóðasáttmálans um borgaraleg og stjórnmálaleg réttindi og var málið fyrir dóminum hvort c-lið 2. mgr. 13. gr. og c. Dómstóllinn skoðaði hvort sáttmálinn væri að hluta sjálfstjórn og gerði það með því að athuga hvort lágmarkshornsefni væri að eiga við. Dómstóllinn hélt því fram að ekki hafi fundist slíkt ákvæði í samningnum (A og B gegn ríkisstjórn Zürich 2000).<br/><br/>Það er nauðsynlegt að skilja að þessi mál eru frábrugðin grundvallarspurningu um hvort hægt sé að beita alþjóðalögum sem hluta af lögum landsins? Til þess að svara þessari spurningu mun pappírinn skoða dóm Hæstaréttar Dóminíska lýðveldisins. Hæstiréttur lýsti því yfir að 3. gr. stjórnarskrá Dóminíska lýðveldisins hafi gert alþjóðalög bindandi fyrir innlenda lagaröðina. Dómstóllinn hafnaði skýringum Hæstaréttar um að þessir samningar væru "útlendingar löggjafar" og ekki hluti af innlendri réttarreglu. Hæstiréttur lýsti því yfir að öll sáttmálar Dóminíska lýðveldisins myndu hluta af Dóminíska lögum og því er hægt að lýsa sem sjálfræði (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción og ors, 1997). Hæstiréttur Sviss hefur skoðað hvort Lissabon-sáttmálinn var sjálfstætt starfandi og á við um svissneska háskóla. Dómstóllinn, samkvæmt viðeigandi dómaframkvæmd, á við með beinum hætti ef innihald hans er nákvæmt og skýrt fram á grundvelli ákvörðunar í tilteknu tilviki. norm þarf því að vera réttlætanlegt, þ.e. skilgreina réttindi og skyldur einstaklings og vera beint hjá lögbærum yfirvöldum" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). Það felur í sér að hvort sáttmálinn á við eða ekki, fer eftir því hvort norm er réttlætanlegt. Lissabonsáttmálinn byggist á meginreglunni um menntun sem aflað er um borð. Þetta er miðlað með IV. mgr. 1. gr. samningsins. Tilgangur þessa var að skapa skyldur til ríkja til að sýna fram á að ákvörðunarferli þeirra sé sanngjörn, gagnsæ og án mismununar. Ábyrgðin á því að sanna að umsækjandi hafi ekki uppfyllt tilskilin skilyrði er á matið. Í samningnum er tryggt að öryggisvarnir, sem almennt eru samþykktar af löndum og þar af leiðandi, hafi dómstóllinn sýnt fram á mismunandi túlkun sem dómstólar í ýmsum löndum taka á.<br/><br/>Nauðsynlegt er að fylgjast með því hvort farið er fram á að farið sé að gildandi lögum úr ýmsum lögsagnarumdæmum hafi lagt áherslu á að innlendir dómstólar séu endanlegt valdvald um það hvort sakborningur sé sjálfstætt starfandi. Einnig er um að ræða eðlislæga skyldu sem varpað er á lönd til varðveislu og áreiðanleika við framkvæmd sáttmála. Slíkt er rekið af sáttmálanum um persónuvernd eins og falið er í 26. gr. Vínarsamkomulagsins um sáttmála (VCLT). Í 27. gr. leitast við að styrkja það með því að benda á að alþjóðlegar lagaskuldbindingar geti ekki hunsað með því að nota innlend lög sem réttlæting. Margir dómstólar hafa notað þetta sem túlkun, svo sem stjórnarskrárdómstólsins í lettneska stjórnarskránni. Þegar um er að ræða norm sem stangast á við alþjóðlegt norm hélt dómurinn því að þjóðarreglan væri ógild og ógild. Til að ná niðurstöðum sínum treysti dómurinn sterklega á mikilvægi hagsmuna í góðri trú eins og kveðið er á um í 26. gr. VLT (Linuja v Lettland, 2004).<br/><br/>Niðurstaða:<br/><br/>Af framansögðu er ljóst að samningarnir hafa sérstakar kröfur áður en þeir geta talist sjálfsframleiddar. Hins vegar er mikilvægt að halda öllum þessum utan um túlkun dómstóla. Ríkisdómstólarnir ákveða hvort hægt sé að kalla sáttmálann sjálfræði eða ekki. Þrátt fyrir að stjórnarskrárskip þeirra hafi að geyma ákvæði um samningslög sé æðsta lögmál landsins, eru dómstólar frá mismunandi löndum túlka þessi ákvæði á mismunandi hátt. Þetta má sjá til þess að bæði bandaríska og Dóminíska stjórnarskrárnar innihaldi þessi ákvæði, en fylgja alveg ólíkum túlkunum á sama hátt. Hugtakið „sjálfræðisleg“ getur ekki verið hugrökk fyrir þessum samningum síðan í reynd, þau þurfa enn samþykki frá innlendum dómstólum. Helst ætti að vera leiðin áfram að löndin viðurkenni sjálfstjórnarríki og komi fram við þá á tísku þar sem 26. og 27. gr. VLT eru virtir. Aftur, þetta er "valin" aðstæður og er ekki líklegt að finna leið sína í ástand lögsögum hvenær sem er fljótlega. Samt sem áður er hægt að öðlast von með því að skoða túlka landsdómana sem virða þessar reglur og vonandi ryðja brautina fyrir aðra dómstóla til að viðurkenna þetta.<br/><br/>Tilvitnanir:<br/><br/>Burgenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Á bak við tjöldin Tragedies Sem hafði áhrif á Kassinn á dauðasta grípa sjónvarpsinnar<br/><br/>Neðri veiðikvótar<br/><br/>Jafnvel þó áhöfnin á Deadliest Grípa til meirihluta peninga sinna frá Discovery, það þýðir ekki að þeir selja ekki tímann sinn. Svo, þú gætir sagt að þeir hafi tvær heimildir af tekjum, sem er eitthvað sem flestir í starfi sínu hafa ekki.<br/><br/>Aftur á árinu 2017 hóf Alaska deildin fisk- og leikjadeildina kvótakerfi, sem takmarkaði magn fiskibátsins sem hægt er að færa til baka um helming.

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Skoðaðu úrval okkar af bloggum sem aðrir starfsmenn skrifa.<br/><br/>UPPLÝSINGAR BLOGG<br/><br/>Ekki stressa það<br/><br/>eftir<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; 12. nóv. 2020<br/><br/>Streita, sama hversu góðir hlutir eru í gangi, það getur alltaf fundið leið til að aftan ljótt höfuð sitt. Hvort sem það er í síðasta mínútu vinnubeiðni eða pappír sem þú gleymdir að skrifa og það er vegna næsta dag, getur streita alltaf fundið leið inn í daginn ef þú leyfir það. Í dag mun ég sýna þér nokkur atriði sem þú getur gert til að útrýma eða koma í veg fyrir streitu.<br/><br/>Það fyrsta sem þú getur gert er að æfa.Að æfa er frábær leið til að létta streitu vegna þess að það lækkar streituhormónið í líkamanum þekktur sem corisol.Lærra stig ristrustóls í líkamanum þínum, því lægra streitustigið verður. Hreyfing getur einnig aukið sjálfstraust þitt og þegar traust þitt er upp þá er streitan þín venjulega niður. Fyrir mig, þegar ég er stressaður, æfa ég alltaf með því að fara í ræktina og æfa boxið, hjálpar það mér að brenna hitaeiningar og draga úr streitu á meðan ég skemmta mér.<br/><br/>Að skrifa hluti niður hefur verið leið til að róa fólk niður í mjög langan tíma, og það er næsta umræðuefni á listanum okkar. Skrifa niður hvað er að gera þér stressað er leið til að hreinsa hugann og það hjálpar einnig að losna við streitu. Ég hef svipaða reynslu þegar skrifa sögur, yfirleitt ef ég get ekki hugsað um nýja hugmynd vegna gamallar, mun ég skrifa gömlu hugmyndina niður og hugsa um það., Það er þegar nýjar hugmyndir byrja að spretta upp og ég get haldið áfram að skrifa venjulega. Það er sama með streitu. Hugsaðu um straum sem það heldur áfram að flæða niður það er leið þar til það hittir bifur stíflu og þessi stífla flæði vatns og allt byrjar að byggja upp. Eina leiðin til að fá vatn flæði aftur til eðlilegs er að fjarlægja stífluna. Þetta er þar sem skrifað kemur inn. Þegar þú skrifar það niður ertu að fjarlægja streitustykki með stykki þar til þú getur hugsað venjulega aftur.<br/><br/>Streita getur komið inn í líf okkar í gegnum dyr í lífi okkar sem við höldum opnum. Procrastination er leið sem við getum skilið dyr opnar fyrir streitu. Bíð þar til á morgun gæti verið skemmtilegt fyrir þig í dag, en það mun meiða þig á morgun, og er mjög stutt-sýnd lausn. Því lengur sem þú bíður eftir að gera eitthvað, því stærri verður eitthvað og því stærri verður það meiri streitu sem þú verður að bjóða í lífi þínu. Að hugsa um eitthvað um leið og við fáum það er frábær leið til að koma í veg fyrir streitu, en það er eitthvað sem tekur mikla grein til að gera. Því meira sem þú klippir Proprastation út úr lífi þínu, því meira streitu frjáls þú verður. Svo loka þessum dyrum, þú ert að láta allt kalt loft út.<br/><br/>Svo skulum við fara yfir: Æfing, skrifa niður hvað er stressandi þú, og Ekki Procrastinate.Þetta eru aðeins nokkrar leiðir til að létta streitu en við mig, þeir eru skilvirkasta. Þó að ég viti að þetta geti ekki virkað fyrir alla þá sem mig langar til að bjóða öllum streitu við að rannsaka hvernig á að losna við það. |
