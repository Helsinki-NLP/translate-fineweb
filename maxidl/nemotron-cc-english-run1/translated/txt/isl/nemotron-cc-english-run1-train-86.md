| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire-safnið<br/><br/>Sögulega hverfið Leclaire, sem eitt sinn var nefnt „undirhverfi Edwardsville til suðurs“, var stofnað sem samstarfssamfélag árið 1890 og var áfram sérstakt þorp þar til það hafði verið innlimað í borgina Edwardsville árið 1934. Dagblöð og tímarit um Bandaríkin og Evrópu sem greint er frá í Leclaire tilrauninni, sérstaklega á fyrstu 20 árum tilveru sinnar. Árið 1979, vegna einstakrar sögu þess, var fyrrum þorpið skráð á National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire var stofnað af Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis pípulagningaframleiðandanum sem, í mörg ár, leitaði til að þróa ljós vinnustéttarinnar. Nelson vildi bæta vinnuaðstæður fyrir starfsmenn sína og veita húsnæði nálægt verksmiðjum svo starfsmenn og fjölskyldur þeirra gætu auðveldlega tekið þátt í afþreyingar- og fræðsluáætlunum sem fyrirtækið býður upp á. Fyrir 1890 tóku framleiðslu- og dreifingarfyrirtæki N. O. Nelson fyrirtækisins að skila hagnaði ásamt fræðslu og afþreyingarmöguleikum. Leclaire samstarfstilraunin myndi skila viðbótarávinningi.<br/><br/>Þegar Nelson tilkynnti að þeir vildu flytja til dreifbýlisstaðs vildu fulltrúar fyrirtækja í smábæjum í nokkrum Missouri og Illinois samfélögum nálægt höfuðstöðvum þeirra. Þeir voru að leita að hentugum eignum til að byggja upp nýjar verksmiðjur og þorp. Suður af Edwardsville þeir fundu 125 hektara landsvæði með aðgang að vatni, kolum og flutningi. Á innan við þremur vikum jókst samfélagið um $ 20,000 frá einstökum framlögum upp á $ 1 til $ 1,000 að tæla Nelson að velja Edwardsville fyrir fyrirtæki sitt.<br/><br/>Borgarleiðtogar höfðu vonast til að finna eign innan borgarmarka Edwardsville, en þegar engin hentug síða fannst, voru þeir fullviss um að Nelson fjárfestingu suður af bænum myndi brátt verða hluti af Edwardsville. Þrátt fyrir að Nelson hafi uppfyllt öll tengsl byggingar- og atvinnusköpunar í samningi sínum, væri það 44 ár áður en hann gekk til Edwardsville. Lecleaire, bundin af Madison/brown Avenues til austurs, járnbrautir til vesturs, Hadley/McKinley Avenues á suður- og Wolf Street til norðurs, var sjálfstætt þorp frá 1890 til 1934. Á þeim tíma fékk það orðspor fyrir nýsköpun í viðskiptum, menntun og skipulagningu íbúðarhúsnæðis.<br/><br/>The village Leclaire on 1931 kort af Edwardsville<br/>Dómstóll í Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Í lok 1880 var hann alþjóðlegur leiðtogi á sviði samvinnu og stafrænnar samskipta við aðra um allan heim á meðan St Louis fyrirtækið stækkaði. Hann nefndi tilraunaþorp sitt eftir hlutkesti Parísar, Edme Jean Leclaire, en hann heimsótti margar aðrar þjóðfélagsskoðanir sem veittu upplýsingar og innblástur. Með því að taka saman bestu hugmyndirnar úr þessum dæmum, stofnaði Nelson Leclaire til, með orðum sínum: „Gefðu verk, veita afþreyingu, fóstri og búa til heimili.“ Þetta voru allir þættir sem hann ákvað að menn færi að lifa lífinu. Síðar notuðu rithöfundarnir þessi orð til að móta meginreglur Leclaires: Vinna, heimili, menntun, afþreyingar og fegurð, en með viðbótar mikilvægri meginreglu frelsis.<br/><br/>Vinna<br/><br/>Vinna gæti talist mikilvægasti þátturinn þar sem án verksmiðjustarfsins í Leclaire, það væri ekkert þorp. Steinsteyparnar voru hannaðar af arkitekti E. A. Cameron til að bjóða upp á náttúrulega birtu, loftræstingu á sumrin og upphituð gólf á veturna. Það var brunabótakerfi og þótt iðnaðarslys hafi ekki verið útrýmt var reynt að tryggja öryggi verkamanna. Hið líflega múrsteinsbyggingar voru umkringdar vel handsmíðuðum grasflötum og blómagörðum sem gefa flóknan yfirbragð. Árið 1894 kallaði New York World skýrslan Nellie Bly byggingar „fullkomnar byggingar fyrir mann til að vinna í“.<br/><br/>Framleiðslusamstæðan N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company í Leclaire<br/>Frá Vinum Leclaire<br/><br/>Starfsmenn Nelsons gætu unnið sér inn hluta af hagnaðinum og haft rödd í fyrirtækinu ef þeir kjósa þann valkost. Það voru nokkur stuttvinnuverkföll í gegnum árin, en fyrir flesta voru vinnuvandamál sjaldgæf. Launþegar höfðu einnig eðlilegan vinnutíma og samkeppnishæf laun. Það var framtakssjóður sem veitti lífeyrissjóðum og veikindaorlofi, sem og ekkjulífeyrir ef launamaður dóu, hvort sem hann tengist starfi sínu eða ekki.<br/><br/>Höfuðstöðvar fyrirtækisins N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) voru áfram í St. Louis, en öll N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company var flutt til Leclaire. Árið 1900 urðu verslunarnar sjálfstæð fyrirtæki í skattalegum tilgangi en allar voru enn í eigu N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Hið faglærða handverksmenn sem unnu hér tóku einnig við sérstökum samningum, þar á meðal leigukvíum fyrir heimabanka og altari sem enn er í notkun við St. Andrew's Epicpal Church í Edwardsville. The Marble Shop sérhæfir sig í arkitektúr marmara sem var skorið og sett upp af Nelson áhöfnum á heimilum, fyrirtækjum og jafnvel ríkisborgurum um Miðvesturlandið. Machine Shop, sem varð Bignall og Keeler, gerði pípa festingarvélar, dælur, sára og ýmis vélræn verkfæri sem búast má við í pípuviðskiptum.Þeir tóku einnig að framleiða sérgreinavörur eins og Leclaire Bike í miðju-1890s. Brass Shop inniheldur smiðju þar sem ýmis pípur og verkfæri voru framleidd.Þetta dæmi sýna aðeins hluta af verkinu sem unnið var í Leclaire verksmiðjunum. merki fyrirtækisins var stílað "NONCO" sem enn má sjá á pípulögunum og sumum eldhýdrum í Edwardsville í dag.<br/><br/>Heimili<br/><br/>Áður en hægt var að byggja húsnæði var þörf fyrir starfsmenn sem voru að ljúka verksmiðjuhúsnæði og byggja hús. Til að mæta þeim þörfum byggði fyrirtækið "Club House", stór bygging sem þjónaði mörgum tilgangi. Auk gistingar var það fyrsta menntahúsið í samfélaginu og það inniheldur vel búið bókasafn.<br/><br/>Framkvæmdir við íbúðarhluta Leclaire hófust strax eftir að þorpið var stofnað í júní 1890. Júlíus Pitzman, nýstárlegi landslagsarkitektúr sem lagði fyrstu lóðina í Leclaire, setti þau upp með nokkrum verndandi sáttmála. sáttmálarnir, sem veitt eru í víðu, hryllilegu götum, stórum hlutum og afmörkun sem takmarka aðeins eignir til íbúðarhúsnæðis eða menntunar. Fyrirtækið setti götuljósin upp, setti upp hliðarleiðir og gróðursettu hundruð trjánna meðfram Leclaire-strætunum. Síðari hluti af Leclaire var lagður út með hefðbundinni hönnun og smærri hlutum, en samt voru í raun gerðar takmarkanir.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage árið 1907.<br/>Frá Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Upphaflega voru heimili smíðað af fyrirtækinu og síðan seld á nálægum kostnað til að hvetja starfsmenn til heimiliseignar. Ef starfsmaður varð veikur og gat ekki veðnað hans voru greiðslur slitnar fyrr en hann sneri aftur til starfa. Heimilin voru í boði í ýmsum húshönnun og fyrirtækið auglýsti að engar tvær bústaðir væru eins og, elstu heimilin voru fyrst og fremst í viktorískum stíl sem kom með rafmagn og rennandi vatn. Þar á eftir voru bústaðir, ferhyrningar og jafnvel nokkur Kit heimili. Íbúar gætu keypt fyrirtæki sem byggð er á heimili eða keypt mikið og byggt upp hús sjálf, að því tilskildu að byggingarhönnunin uppfyllti kröfur fyrirtækisins.<br/><br/>Á síðari árum voru margir seldir til fjárfesta, venjulega Edwardsville íbúa og mörg heimili á þriðja áratug síðustu aldar voru byggðir af staðbundnum verktökum sem síðan seldu þá til íbúa á svæðinu.<br/><br/>Menntun<br/><br/>Nelson trúði á menntun fyrir alla, þar á meðal vinnustéttina. Menntun hófst með leikskóla í Club House árið 1892 og hélt áfram í nýju fræðsluhúsinu á 722 Holyrood Road. Almennt kallað "Skólahúsið", þessi bygging veitti stórum sal fyrir fundi og forrit, en hafði hreyfanlega skiptingu til að skipta því í stofurými á daginn. Á kvöldin voru dansnir, fundir eða dagskrá Leclaire Self-Culture klúbbsins sem haldin var vikulega fyrirlestra hjá prófessor Washington háskóla eða þjóðþekktum fyrirlesara sem, eins og N. O. Nelson, voru hluti af félagslegri betri hreyfingu við aldamótin. Þar á meðal eru Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones og rithöfundurinn Charlotte Perkins Gilman.<br/><br/>Börn sem eru skráðir í Leclaire leikskólanum árið 1913<br/>Frá Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Á tíu árum eftir 1895 byggingu menntabyggingar voru ýmsar fræðslutilraunir, þar á meðal iðnaðarskóli, háskóla, skemmtiskóli og akademíu. Fyrsta og lengsta verkefnið var morgunnámið, stofnað árið 1892, sem notaði Fröbel líkanið. Þetta tveggja ára verkefni var ókeypis fyrir alla, þar á meðal Edwardsville börn, til 1931 þegar af fjármálaástæðum hóf fyrirtækið að hlaða skóla til nemenda sem ekki voru börn starfsmanna. Nelson Manufacturing rekur leikskóla fram til 1934 þegar húsið var snúið til Edwardsville School District fyrir lágmarks gjald.<br/><br/>Afþreying<br/><br/>Bátar á Leclaire Lake árið 1915<br/>Frá Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Afþreying var mikilvægur þáttur í Leclaire. Fyrirtækið veitti íþróttaaðstöðu fyrir hafnabolta, tennis og síðar, fótbolta og biljarðsal var byggt upp og það var vatn fyrir báta, sund, veiðar eða skauta á veturna. Leclaire Park var búin með bátum, karlkyns og kvenkyns baðhúsum og stórum skála. Íbúar skipulagðu dans, heyringar, stafni og aðra starfsemi, og fyrirtækið styrkti hljómsveit sem lék reglulega á skemmtistöðum í þorpinu eða í Edwardsville. Eins og menntastarfsemi í Club House og School House, afþreyingaraðstöðu í Leclaire voru opin öllum og voru oft áfangastað fyrir Edwardsville og jafnvel St. Louis gestir.<br/><br/>Fegurð<br/><br/>Ljósmynd ferðalangs tekin í Leclaire Lake<br/>Frá Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Síðasti þátturinn sem Nelson taldi mikilvægt fyrir ánægjulegt líf um umhverfið. Nelson vissi um mikilvægi heilbrigðs lífs. Hann meti fegurð og hreinlæti sem fannst í landinu og hvatti alla í Leclaire til að fegra eign sína með gróðursetningu garða og aldingarða. Nelson leiddi sjálfur til dæmis til þess að fyrirtæki gróðurhús veitti ókeypis blómum og keppnum var haldið í fallegustu görðunum. Leclaire var lögð fram þannig að allt þorpið væri eins og garður væri enn áberandi í dag.<br/><br/>Frelsið<br/><br/>Leclaire Cooperative verslunin<br/>Frá Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson setti fimm stofnreglur fyrir Leclaire, en nútímahöfundar bættu við sjötta sæti: Frelsi. Öll forrit sem fyrirtækið bauð upp á voru í boði fyrir starfsmenn og heimamenn, en enginn var skylt. Frelsið til að velja hvort að taka þátt í fyrirtækjanámi var algjörlega upp til einstaklinga. Íbúar Leclaires gætu unnið fyrir Nelson framleiðslu eða annars staðar og starfsmenn væru ekki skyldugir til að búa í Leclaire. Þá var einnig hægt að taka þátt í afþreyingar- og fræðsluáætlunum. Einnig var fyrirtækjaverslun þar sem starfsfólk gæti verslað, en ólíkt öðrum fyrirtækjum, enginn var í skuld við fyrirtækið verslun. Leclaire Store var samvinnufyrirtæki þar sem félagsmenn voru rukkaðir sanngjarnt markaðsverð, en voru síðan greiddir ársfjórðungslega arður.<br/><br/>Öðruvísi fyrirtækjabær<br/><br/>Allir þessir kostir gerðu Leclaire einstakt frá öðrum bæum fyrirtækisins en það voru einnig einstakir þættir þar sem fyrirtækið sýndi samúð og umhyggju fyrir starfsfólki. Fyrirtækið lokaði verksmiðjum og réð lestum til að taka starfsmenn og fjölskyldur þeirra til St Louis í einn dag á árunum 1904 St Louis World's Fair. Þegar peningar voru þéttir myndi Nelson stundum leggja auka pening í hverri umsvifa til að auðvelda launamanni og ef hann lagði af stað þá samþykktu þeir það ekki og eins oft og ekki myndi Nelson snúa við sjálfum sér.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson fæddist í Lillesand í Noregi árið 1841 og var heimsborgari sem trúði á frjálsu fyrirtæki, en einnig félagsmaður, meðlimur í "Golden Rule", og patriot sem þjónaði Sambandinu í borgarastríðinu. Árið 1900 var hann fjölmálari en þegar hann lést árið 1922 hafði hann gefið honum allt til betra starfsstéttina.<br/><br/>Þrátt fyrir að Lecleaire væri ekki eini félagsleg tilraun Nelson, er það talið farsælasta verkefni hans. Önnur mikilvæg viðleitni til félagslegs betri felur í sér keðju á samvinnuvöruverslunum í New Orleans, leikskóla fyrir börn svartra starfsmanna í Besser, Alabama, verksmiðjum og heimili fyrir neyslu á Indlandi, Kaliforníu.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire var þekktur alþjóðlegur sem athyglisverður og árangursríkur tilraun. Það var lýst í New York World um ýmis tækifæri en sérstaklega af fréttamanni Nellie Bly árið 1894 sem skrifaði í lengd um fyrirsæta bæinn þar sem "Starfsspurningin er leyst og allir ánægðir í litlu þorpi nálægt St. Louis."

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Höfundur heimsækir í gegnum Zoom eða Skype<br/><br/>Ég hlakka til að heimsækja nemendur þína í gegnum Zoom eða Skype! Skype er frábær kostur fyrir skóla/námskeið sem eru ekki að koma með í eigin persónu höfunda, heldur sem vilja kanna bækur og ljóð, tengjast höfundi og spyrja einn-á-einn spurninga.<br/><br/>Kostnaður<br/><br/>Ég býð upp á 30-45 mínútna Zoom eða Skype heimsóknir með skólum fyrir $ 125 á hverja lotu (eða $ 200 fyrir tvo tíma að gerast innan þriggja tíma á morgnana eða síðdegis; $ 325 fyrir þrjá tíma á einum degi; $ 425 fyrir fjóra tíma á einum degi).

Tímasetningin gæti ekki samstillist rétt, sem gerir að lesa saman áskorun, og það er mjög erfitt fyrir mig að heyra nemendur nema þeir komi upp og tala beint inn í hljóðnemann/tölvuna. En eftir nokkra reynslu og villu, hef ég uppgötvað nokkrar leiðir til að hafa bestu sýndarheimsóknir sem hægt er. Hér eru: 10 leiðir til að gera heimsókn mína með nemendum þínum frábæra upplifun!<br/><br/>Áður en heimsóknin er heimsótt<br/><br/>Fáðu börnin eins spennandi og hægt er um heimsóknina. Farðu á vefsíðu mína með þau. Lestu nokkrar af bókum mínum með þeim. Allt sem þú gerir á undan tíma til að láta það líða eins og STÓRU FERÐ muni fara langa leið til þátttöku nemenda.<br/><br/>Stöðvaðu myndbandsmyndavélina eða fartölvuna með vefmyndavél svo ég geti séð eins mikið af áhorfendum og mögulegt er.Það er erfitt að meta þátttöku nemenda þegar ég get aðeins séð nokkra nemendur.<br/><br/>Takmarka hvern hóp til 50 nemenda og það er ótrúlega erfitt að taka þátt í stórum hópum í gegnum myndband.<br/><br/>Ég mun flytja fljótt frá efni eða ljóð til ljóðs. Vinsamlegast minna nemendur á að þeir þurfa að hlusta nær til að skilja hvað er að gerast.<br/><br/>Stundum geri ég smá lesinn leikhús með nemendum.Ef ég sendi þér handritaða hluta fyrir tímann, prentaðu afrit fyrir EACH setu og klipptu í stykki, ef þörf krefur.<br/><br/>Á meðan á heimsókninni stendur<br/><br/>Þegar ég tala um bók, ef þú hefur það prentað bók, vinsamlegast hafðu það upp fyrir nemendur til að sjá.<br/><br/>Þú ert umboðsaðili minn. Ég get oft ekki hringt í nemendur og heyrt einstaka svör. Svo, kannski segi ég: Við erum að fara að fá 3 hugmyndir. Þá tekur þú yfir, hringdu í þrjá nemendur, og tilkynntu þeim svör við öllum í herberginu og mér.<br/><br/>Veldu sjálfstraust, fráfarandi nemendur fyrir handritaða nemendahluta (ef ég sendi einhvern tímann). Í heimsóknum mínum í eigin persónu reyni ég að draga út nokkra af þeim minna sjálfsöruggu nemendum, en ég hef komist að því að þetta virkar ekki eins vel við sýndarheimsóknir vegna þess að ég get ekki heyrt þær.<br/><br/>Hafa nemendur með að tala hluta sitja fyrir framan. Þegar það er kominn tími, láta þá standa upp og minna þá á að tala skýrt.<br/><br/>Í sýndarheimsóknum fellur hegðunin eingöngu á þig. Ég get oft ekki séð nákvæmlega hvað er að gerast, svo gerðu vinsamlegast skref í eftir þörfum. Ef það er stór röskun, bara biðja mig um að halda áfram í smá stund svo ég deili ekki á meðan enginn er að borga eftirtekt: >>)<br/><br/>Ekki hika við að taka myndir af mér á skjánum og deila á samfélagsmiðlum - jafnvel þótt myndir af mér líti oft illa út vegna þess að ég er að gera fyndið andlit eða eitthvað á meðan ég lesa!<br/><br/>Ef þú hefur einhverjar spurningar yfirleitt, vinsamlegast bara spyrja, annað hvort fyrir eða meðan á heimsókninni stendur!<br/><br/>Að skipuleggja sýndartíma<br/><br/>Hefur þú áhuga á að skipuleggja sýndarheimsókn með mér? Sendu mér bara tölvupóst til að setja upp dagsetningu og við munum fara þaðan |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Fréttir Archive<br/><br/>Nýja bók lítur á leiðir til að takast á við HIV-áskorun<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prófessor Dennis Francis með Marjorie Human sem hannaði forsíðu bókarinnar, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>Heimsfaraldur HIV hefur fært út bestu og versta hvað varðar viðbrögð manna, annars vegar hefur það leitt til þess að það hefur valdið lömum og ofbeldi og hins vegar stuðlað að uppbyggilegum og stuðningsfullum viðbrögðum frá ýmsum einstaklingum og hópum. Ný bók, lögum um HIV, breytt af Prof. Dennis Francis, deildarforseti menntunar við háskólann í Frjálsu ríki, lítur á hvernig hægt er að nota drama til að stuðla að mikilvægum félagslegum breytingum og hegðunarbreytingum.<br/><br/>Í HIV er boðið upp á kerfisbundna fyrirspurn í drama sem nálgun til að ræða HIV/AIDS og tengdar viðhorf og hegðun. Bókin er fræðilegur texti og inniheldur verk nokkurra tuttugu skapandi höfunda. Meðal annars sem fram fer í bókinni má nefna prófessor Hazel Barnes (University of the Wittersrand), Rob Pattman (Stelnebosch University) og Yvonne Slipe frá Háskólanum í KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>Þetta verkefni hófst árið 2009 og hefur tekið mikinn tíma að koma saman listaverk skapandi höfunda. Rannsóknirnar sem miðlað er í gegnum bókina eru frumlegar og tímabærar og leggja verulega áherslu á samtöl um hlutverk/málefni og þýðingu á leiklist við málefni HIV og AIDS," segir prófessor Francis. |

The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Uppskrift á að prófa áhrif andvara á Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus, í Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Aðferðirnar16 September 2008<br/><br/>Ég valdi að nota bláa krabbann, Callinectus sapidus, fyrir tilraun mína vegna þess að það er nóg hér í Barnegat Bay og það er tiltölulega auðvelt að veiða.<br/><br/>Kalliðar sapidus er sundkrakrakram sem skiptir máli fyrir mjúkskel krabba, bæði atvinnu- og tómstundaferil (Jivoff 2008) Aðalaðferðin við krabbaraska gildru<br/><br/>Draugakarar eiga sér stað þegar gildrur tapast heldur áfram að veiða lífverur (Breen 1990) John Wnek segir að það séu auðveldlega 2.000 í Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus er svo árásargjarn (Pollock 1998), hvað gerist þegar þeir lenda í búrinu án matar og hvaða áhrif hafa þetta?<br/><br/>Ef lent er í draugakarpi, C. sapidus mun hafa kannabishneigingar þar til síðasta hefur liðið frá gangsetningu.<br/><br/>Hvernig tryggjum við draugakarpa í rannsóknarstofunni?Búa draugakarpi með því að loka dyrum með vírneti og zip tengingarÞegar sýnis eru hlaðnar er lokað á toppnum með zip tengingum<br/><br/>Krabbi inngangur lokað með vír möskva<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire skeriRopeCameraZip Tengsl<br/><br/>Hvernig fáum við krabbar?Ertu nokkra daga snemma og reyndu að byrja, safnaðu nýjum krabbam beint í gildru með 2 frá sveltu tanki<br/><br/>Sex krabbar samtals, einn saknaður lítið pláss til að flýja vegna þess; skipt upp með zip TieTwo krabbas dauðurE bara hefur klemma til vinstriAnnað vantar bæði paddles og einn klær<br/><br/>Fjórir krabbar á lífi og ósnortinn Stærri dauði krabba hefur ekki breystSmærri dauði krabba hefur aðeins hluta af carapic vinstri<br/><br/>Síðasti dagur tilraunaTook tveggja sýna Engar breytingar frá öðrum degi í fyrstu sýnisjá, stærri carapace aðskilin frá hvíld á líkams-/kláðu<br/><br/>Á grundvelli niðurstöðunnar hafnaði ég null tilgátu um að krabbarnir verði einfaldlega í gildrunni.

Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters.

The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Real Estate orð dagsins: Valkostur<br/><br/>Valkostur: Samkomulag til að halda opnu, í ákveðinn tíma, tilboð um að selja eða leigja fasteign. Hægt er að nota valmöguleikann, til dæmis til að gefa kaupandanum tíma til að leysa spurningar um fjármögnun, titil, skipulag og hagkvæmni áður en hann skuldbindur kaupanda að kaupa. The valkostur verður að vera studd af raunverulegu sjónarmiði þess, aðskilin og óháð kaupverði eignarinnar. Sjaldan tillitsemi ein og sér nægir ekki nema í leigurétti þar sem ákvæði leigusamnings eru sjálf nógur til að styðja við þann kost. Möguleikar búa aðeins til samningsrétt; það gefur ekki valkostinum neitt bút á gististaðnum. Á þeim tíma er valkosturinn undirritaður, eigandinn selur ekki né selur kaupandinn, gististaðurinn. Þó að eigandi sé skylt að selja ef hann hefur fengið tilkynningu frá kaupanda er kaupandi ekki skylt að kaupa. Val um kaup er einnig þekkt sem símtal; valkostur til að selja er þekktur sem sett. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Ávinningur af Carotenoids fyrir húðina<br/><br/>Hefur þú heyrt um karótenóíð?
