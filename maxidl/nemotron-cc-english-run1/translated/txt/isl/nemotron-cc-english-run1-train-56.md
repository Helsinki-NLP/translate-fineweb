| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Þó að viðurkenna að það er ómögulegt að halda því fram að einhver elski eitthvað sem þeir hata, og öfugt, þá er það enn oft gaman að reyna rökin.

Stundum skaðar það minna ef þú rífa Band-Aid burt allt í einu. (Og jafnvel ef það er ekki, sem vill ganga um það með hálfgerðum Band-Aid? Gross.) Staðreyndin er sú að ég fann Hugo að vera leiðandi æfingar í fakery, frá opnun glæðunnar í París lestastöð, sem minnti mig meira en allt frá því að Robert Zemeckis' Polar Express. Ólíkt Mike D'Angelo, þá er ég aðdáandi langra, óséðra tekur það sem leið til að koma á rými og hvetja áhorfendur til að halda öndunum á sem myndavél kannast við svæði; en þegar rýmið er skoðað er flott, glansandi CGI sköpun og myndavélin svífur í gegnum það með engum líkamlegu skilningi á því að myndavélin eða umhverfið er í raun og veru, þá fer könnunin að líða eins og að horfa á einhvern annan leik í tölvuleik.

Ditto stílun Jean-Pierre Jeunet, sérstaklega í Amélie. (Bæði Jeunet og Luhrmann leið eins og sterk sjónræn áhrif hér.) Ég fékk þá tilfinningu að Martin Scorsese vildi mig taka Hugo alvarlega.

Ef þú ert að leita að innblæstri fyrir Hugo— reyndar, ef þú ert að leita að tilfinningalegri kjarna Hugo— þú þarft að fara aftur til að skora æskuárin á Elizabeth Street á Little Italy, þar sem astistic litla strák, ófær um að leika úti með hinum börnunum, hörfa Alexander Korda ímyndunarafl eins og The Of Bagdad. Eða einfaldlega, bara fara beint til uppruna sjálfs: George Méliès, þar sem A Trip To The Moon er enn Big Bang af öllum kvikmyndahúsum, þessi stund þegar myndavélin var ekki notuð til að skjalfesta heiminn eins og það er, en hvað whimical, töfrandi, flytja stað kvikmyndagerðarmaður vill finna fyrir það. Og þessi hefð hefur verið þróuð og stækkað í áratugi áður en líkar við Jeúnet og Luhrmann fékk gróflega litla loppa sína á því.<br/><br/>Og tala um Jeunet, gaman að reyna að taka burt dularfulla vopn, en ég skal segja það samt: Hvernig er hægt að elska Amélie, en finna Hugo gervi og "ofsa" og "þungt"? Þú segir að Amélie og Moulin Rouge hafi leyst úr læðingi „sense of [andlit þeirra] þar sem Scorse þýðir að við tökum Hugo alvarlega, og ég held ekki að það sé raunin, að minnsta kosti á síðari tímapunkti. Það stigar finnur fyrir augljósri ástríðu um kvikmyndirnar er ég að ætla, hvers vegna þú myndir túlka Hugo sem sjálfs alvarleg.En mér er það þeim tilfinningum sem gefa myndinni tilfinningalega andstæðu sem Luhrmann og Jeunet kvikmyndirnar hafa ekki. Allar þrjár kvikmyndir gera árásargjarna notkun á undur CGI- og Skordýra bætir þrívíddar við blönduna, við dásamleg áhrif – en þar sem þú og ég er mismunandi er um að léttast. Ég er sammála því að CGI hefur sótthreinsiáhrif; Heimar sem eru fullkomlega samsettar af stafrænum plasti eru sveigjanlegir að þeim tímapunkti þar sem þeir hafa stundum enga nærveru. Þú vísaði til Hugo í "Overrated" færslu fyrir okkar Best Of Film piece as "CGI gimcrack" — fullkominn disk... fyrir aðra mynd.<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Það er óhætt að segja að Scoresse hefur byggt Hugo í kringum staðlaða útgáfu, "upptaka" barnabók/kvikmyndaþræði: Orfan missir pabbi sinn, skapar sitt eigið litla draumaheim, glimur á nýjan vin, sannfærir grimmur gamall bóndabarn til að mýkjast og kannski taka upp hann. En það er bara frásögnin beinagrindin, og Scorsese veitir nóg af holdi og blóði. Í einn, þú getur ekki horft á Hugo, einmana drengur, stara út frá klukkuturnum að ys og þys í París lestarstöðinni án þess að hugsa um Scorsese, annar einmana drengur, stara út úr svefnherbergi sínu á Elizabeth Street. Og jafnvel þótt þú sért ekki nógu stór kvikmynd sem þarf til að tengjast, finnst mér ég virkilega eins og ferð Hugo ekki í að finna nýja föðurtölu, heldur í að halda uppi vélrænu töfranni sem stendur eins og arfleifð föður síns. Það er það sem kvikmynd er: þrautseigju sjónarinnar sem gerir okkur kleift að taka upp mynd af heiminum 24 rammar á sekúndu er vísindi og töfrar í einu. Samband Hugo við Méliès snýst ekki um hann að skemmta sér upp á nýjan pabba, heldur að deila sameiginlegum áhuga gamla manninum hefur kafað í biturleika.Til mín, það er miklu fleiri einstök horn á hugsanlega kaupsýsluhúsnæði.<br/><br/>Fékkstu í raun ekkert af Hugo heillandi?En fáu leikstjórarnir virðast vilja viðurkenna að röðin víki kvikmyndasögu og vinnustofu Méliès – með Michael Stuhlburg sem hetja kvikmyndafræðingur!— voru frábær. Það fannst, á besta mögulega hátt, eins og höfuðþjöppun sögunnar af kvikmyndasögunni minni 101 flokki í háskóla, þ.e. að verja virði klippi- og samhengis í eitthvað á milli þess að vera ein og líflegur pop-up bók. Og það talar við hugvitssamlega hönnun kvikmyndarinnar, sem lagar staðreyndir og ímyndunarafl svo fallega að það er í einu sinni sögu Méliès og fæðingu kvikmyndahúss, og bara svona einfalt, framleiddi kvikmynda undrning sem Skorpinn sjálfur hefði elskað sem barn. Kærleikur Hugo fylgir ekki Jeunet/Luhrmann líkaninu og hefur „skyn af eigin fáránleika“. Sem ímyndunarafl connosure sjálfur, myndir þú ekki segja að það sé verðmæti í að spila það beint og óheppilegt frekar en að vinna á áhorfendum?, Þú gætir fundið Hugo veikan en ég held ekki að áreiðanleika á tilfinningu þess er að hafna.<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Tasha: Já, ég fann í raun hluta af Hugo heillandi. (Taktu eftir því hvernig ég er að svara spurningunni þinni fram, á meðan þú varst of upptekinn af að forðast að tala við mig, þó ég geri ráð fyrir að það sé svar í eigin rétti. Allt í lagi, "áhrif" gæti verið að ofmeta málið - ég þýddi bara sjónrænan stíl sem leit mjög kunnugt. Þrátt fyrir að Keith benti á að þegar þú leiddir þetta upp í eigin persónu, er Scorsese ekki andstæða að teikna innblástur frá myndefni annarra, né ónæmur fyrir því.) Fyrst og fremst var ég heillaður af hlutum sem fjalla um baksaga Georges Méliès, með ást hans á kvikmyndahúsum, með verkinu sem hann setti í list hans og gleðina sem hann fékk út úr henni. Það er fullt af fegurð og gaman í sviðsferð neðansjávarvöllur frá Méliès "Fairyland" og í framhaldinu, með áherslu á Méliès myndefni. Ég mun veita þér að tenging Hugo við Méliès yfir sameiginlega ást á myndinni er góð snerting og ég nýt þess að fá góða mynd um kvikmyndagerð.<br/><br/>En Hugo snýst ekki fyrst og fremst um kvikmynd, þrátt fyrir bindi-íhlutir Méliès.Til viðbótar við þemu sem þú ákveður, heldur snýst það líka um að finna tilgang þinn, eins og persónurnar skýra nákvæmlega hvert annað og okkur. Og það snýst um sjón, og stór aðgerð hluti, og chase, og hamingju-langt eftir lok þar sem jafnvel reiður einelti og feiminn eldri par og fergawdsakes jafnvel krakkhundur fá öll parað sig við heillandi ástarhagsmuni í lokin. Þetta snýst um mjög nákvæma Hermione Granger-gerð sem snýst um að vera Stjórinn og gulla og fagna töfrandi veröldinni sem lokið er í bókum og öll þessi viðskipti eru auðþekkjanleg og máttug.<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Já, Scoresse er að spila með bogfimi. Vandamálið er, ég fann aldrei að hann imbued þá með eitthvað nýtt, ferskt eða trúa, þrátt fyrir eigin verksmiðju sína. Ég hefði mikinn áhuga á því að rannsaka ungt stig sem vex upp með astma – eitthvað lítið og raunverulegt, án mikils herbergja full af CGI klukku og gylltum rykmötum og spámannlegum píslarti með hjarta gullsins – allt sem er utan á toppnum. Þú heldur áfram að heimsækja persónulega bakgrunn Sporðdrekans og ást á kvikmyndum eins og vísbendingar um að hann sé virkilega að finna hvað hann er að setja á skjáinn, en ég finn ekki persónulega snertingu sína í einhverju af þessu, nema augnablikin sem eru sérstaklega um kvikmynd. Helstu tilfinningar geta verið raunverulegar, en það gerir ekki framkvæmd minna fals.<br/><br/>Þú segir áreiðanleika tilfinninga er ekki hægt að neita. Ég er ekki spurning um hvort Stigi fannst einmana og einangrað sem barn, en ég finn ekki einmanaleika og einangrun á skjánum - ég sé fullt af gröftum táknum (Hugo er skítugur og klæðnaður hans og allt fullorðinstréð á honum og hann verður að eltast reglulega af skelfilegum hundi!) og stórum börum, með hrópandi og grátandi og Spielísku undræðna-emotion. Fyrir mig er einlægni meira sannfærandi og persónulegri þegar það er rólegt og beint; þegar hrópar á skoðanir hans á mig, geri ég annað hvort reiður, eða bara að reyna að yfirbuga skilningarvitin til að halda mér frá því að tjá mína skoðun. Hugo var eitt langt hrópa, eins langt og ég var áhyggjur.<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Af hverju fékk ég ekki þessi tilfinningu um falsa frá Amélie, þú spyrð? Reyndar spurði ég. Ég mun alveg viðurkenna að Amélie og Moulin Rouge eru bæði stór, yfirgripsmikil, tilbúin framkvæmdir í nákvæmlega sama blái, krefjast sérstakra tilfinninga á sérstökum hléum og reyna að selja þessar tilfinningar með þungri tilfinningar og árásargjarnri hljóðritun. Hvorki af þeim seldi mig í raun á tilfinningum sínum sem ekta mannlega tilfinningu. Það sem ég hafði gaman af í þessum tveimur kvikmyndum var byggingin – sérstaklega höfuð Amélie, hláturslista af handahófskenndum einkennum og reynslum fyrir steyptan og hljóðræna myndskreytingu Moulin Rouge. Ég er oft seldir á sögum sem gera skapandi eða metnaðarfulla hluti með uppbyggingu og bæði þeirra kvikmynda hæfi, þar sem Hugo er mun línuleg, venjuleg krakki-fyrirspurn.<br/><br/>En að lokum, fyrir mig, kemur í raun niður á tilfinningu að þessar kvikmyndir eru goofs, en Hugo er ætlað að taka alvarlega á hverri tracly stundu. Þú heldur ekki að það sé satt – en þú ert samtímis að verja heilleika þess hvað varðar algerlega ekta, sögutilfinningu rætur-í-Scorse og segja mér að ég sé rangt og hann þýðir ekki að það sé tekið alvarlega. Hvernig samræmarðu þessar tvær yfirlýsingar? Hvað um kvikmyndin bendir til þess að það sé ekki ætlað að taka á andliti? Og er mögulegt að þetta sé bara önnur Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-eins og aðstæður þar sem ég finn að notkun barna í stórfjárhagsmyndum til að vera að miklu leyti hamingjusöm og melódratísk, en þú sem pabbi finnur það sem það fer beint að fjölskyldu þinni?<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Scott: Ekki viss um að ég þýddi að Scorsese þýðir ekki að taka alvarlega; það er bara að hann er valinn whimsical ökutæki sem að tjá alvarlega ást á kvikmyndum. Þegar þú segir: "En Hugo snýst ekki fyrst og fremst um kvikmynd, þrátt fyrir að Méliès bindi-in" er ég dulritaður. Ég gef að þú finnir marga þætti Hugo of kunnuglegra og erfiða og full af Spielískra undrunar – það er ekkert sem ég get gert til að halda því fram í kringum þá skynjun, sem aðrir Hugo vafamenn deila. Stundum þýðir kvikmynd að heillast og heillast og það er ekki fyrir suma; þú hefur fengið Hugo og ég hef fengið Amélie, þó ég held það síðar, vísvitandi gervi eins og það er, þýðir fyrir okkur að finna það rómantískt. (Ranngjarnt en, segja, sumir hræðilegur vélrænni samdráttur passa fyrir sá sekkja.)<br/><br/>En til að segja Hugo snýst ekki fyrst og fremst um kvikmynd?Ef það snýst ekki um kvikmynd, þá er það mest áberandi saga um hvað sem þú heldur að það hafi nokkurn tíma séð. Sambandið á milli Hugo og Méliès er hjarta myndarinnar, og í hjarta þess er ekki bara einhver lagertenging milli PEPhan og Crusty Old Guy með hjarta af gulli, heldur sameiginlegri trú fyrir hönnuðu töfra - sérstaklega töfra kvikmyndanna. Ég held að skorpan og samstarfsmenn hans hafi fundið leið til að tjá áhuga sinn á fyrstu dögum kvikmyndanna í gegnum ímyndunarafl sem er aðgengilegt á öllum aldri. (MMmm... baka.)<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Eins og fyrir The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, ég sé ekki mikið af tengingu, annað en að reyna að afhjúpa mig sem Benjamin Button varnarmann sem leið til að skaða trúverðugleika minn. (Ólíklega, hvernig eru aukagildið á því G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Ég hef sagt þér að svefnáfallinn nýr pabbi í mér væri kannski viðkvæmur fyrir Benjamin Button, en ég get ekki ímyndað mér tíma þegar fyrra öldrun í bakkgír myndi ég ekki flytja mig. (Craddleling ást á lífi þínu sem barn? Hvernig er ekki hægt að hafa áhrif á það?) Og að auki sjá ég ekki hvernig Benjamin Button tengist mikið fyrir Hugo sem kvikmynd um börn, þar sem það er bara lítill hluti af sögu sem spannar miklu stærri braut.<br/><br/>Svo hef ég sagt þér það ekki. En ég er ánægður með að læra að Hugo var ekki alveg laus við neitt fyrir þig.Sekjurin á Méliès kvikmyndagerðarmannsins eru það sem setti Hugo yfir fyrir mig – og í það, að minnsta kosti getum við deilt bíómynd ást.<br/><br/>Auglýsingar<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, ég get ekki sagt að þú hafir sannfært mig, meira en ég hef sannfærður um þig.Það er ómögulegt að halda því fram við neinn í ást á einhverju og það ætti í raun að vera jafnt ómögulegt að tala einhvern niður frá ást sem er opin ást. Aðallega, þú hefur látið mig sjá Hugo í Scott-O-Vision, sem er áhugaverð reynsla; að minnsta kosti núna er ég milda sannfærður um að við tókst ekki einhvern veginn að sjá allt mismunandi kvikmyndir sem báðir höfðu sama nafn og leikstjóri.<br/><br/>Við höfðum vissulega mismunandi reynslu, þó, og í huga mínum, einbeitt sér að mismunandi þáttum framleiðslunnar: Ég sé enn ekki "filman" þema sem einn fastur þáttur í myndinni, svo mikið eins og einn meðal margra. Þrátt fyrir að ég myndi kasta í "oft endilega sætur og dýrmætur" ofan á það. Á meðan þú ert að einbeita þér að bragðgóðri bökufyllingu myndarinnar finnst mér eins og þessi böku var þakið kristalískum sykri og ég held að það sé munur, burtséð frá kjarnaskilaboðum myndarinnar eða handfylli af senum. Sjá einnig Benjamin Button, sem ég kom ekki bara upp til að fela þig - ég held að þú hafir meira af tilfinningalegum rák en ég geri varðandi börn í kvikmyndum, sérstaklega þegar þau eru notuð sem tákn um veikleika og sakleysi en eins og mannleg persónur. Heyrðu, þú veist hvaða kvikmynd er algerlega ekki með háar mottur sem hafa von um að vera með hryllilega veröld? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Kannski mun ég fara að horfa á þá Blu-ray auka. Ég gæti notað nokkrar sprengingar-einnæmi til að bæta fyrir sætleika Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | Ég vonaði að dóttir mín væri laus við erfiðir og erfiðir tímar“: „Ég vona að dóttir mín verði laus við að stríða mér.<br/><br/>Vonandi á tímum kreppunnar: Dagur móður<br/><br/>Eftir Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Ég heyrði að hermennirnir væru að koma. Hún tók við syni sínum og hrifsaði af öðrum þorpum sem runnu að landamærum Thai-Burmse, þar sem embætti Flóttamannastofnunar Sameinuðu þjóðanna (UNHCR) var staðsett. Maðurinn hennar var í öðru þorpi sem liggur í gagnstæða átt, Mee lærði síðar.

Um einu sinni í viku, Mee og aðrir myndu vera á ferðinni til að forðast handtaka, nauðgun eða dauða af hermönnum.<br/><br/>Í einu tilfelli hljóp maðurinn minn á undan konu sinni til að tryggja mat fyrir fjölskyldu sína.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Staðfest aðgerð er niðurstaða af sveitarstjórnarlögum 1960, sem byggja á kynþáttarétti, þjóðernisrétti eða kyni. Það var 1978 hæstaréttarákvörðunin, The Regents of University of California v. Bakke, sem gerði kleift að nota til að hlúa að fjölbreytileikanum, sem gerir kleift að nota staðfesta aðgerðir í inntökustefnu. Það var búið til með það í huga að bjóða upp á jöfn tækifæri fyrir félagsmenn í minnihlutahópum í menntun og...sýna miðju skjalsins...<br/><br/>Hins vegar, samkvæmt 2007 skýrslu frá Pew Research Center, hefur stuðningur við samstarfsverkefni Bandaríkjanna í raun aukist verulega á undanförnum árum, klifrað úr 58% árið 1995 í 70% árið 2007. Stuðningur við staðfestandi aðgerð gerir margar rök fyrir því að styðja við ögrandi aðgerð, í von um að fá aðra til að sjá raunverulegt gott að staðfesta aðgerðir sem leiða til samfélagsins. Aðstoðarmenn telja að ógnvænleg aðgerð sé meira en inntökustefna. Háskólar og háskólar taka frumkvæðið að því að ná til minnihlutahópa og hvetja þá til að sækja um. Háskólar og háskólar bjóða upp á viðbótar fjárhagsaðstoð og veita úrræði á háskólasvæðinu til að hjálpa betur háskólamenntun nemandans. Styður einnig við vaxandi fjölda minnihluta umsókna til háskóla og háskóla sem eru að hluta til vegna staðfestra aðgerðastefnu.<br/>Tölfræðin hefur sýnt að þegar verulegar aðgerðir eru eytt, eins og þegar það var í Berkley College og UCLA árið 1998, lækkaði minni inntöku nemenda 61 prósent og 36 prósent í sömu röð, að því gefnu að staðfesta aðgerð gegnir stórt hlutverk í skólaferli. Árangursríkir stuðningsmenn í aðgerð telja einnig að fjölbreytileiki í æðri menntun veiti betri mennta andrúmsloft fyrir alla nemendur, persónulega og vitsmunalega. Ef hægt væri að afnema verulegar aðgerðir, það væri færri minnihlutanemar sem skráðir voru í háskóla, sem veldur því að fjölbreytni er frekar grannur. Einnig er nauðsynlegt að bæta við stefnu um kynþátta-, efnahags- og félagslega kúgun. Einstaklingar með hærri félagslega stöðu hafa fleiri tækifæri en þeir sem eru með lægri félagslegan bakgrunn. Styður telja að ákveðnar kynþátta- eða þjóðernishópa séu óskemmdir vegna þess að þeir eru oft á minni tekjuheimilum og þar af leiðandi ekki fyrir sömu úrræðum og nemendur frá hærri félagshagfræðitímum. Talsmenn styðja hugmyndina um samkeppni milli nemenda á grundvelli verðleika, en halda því fram að staðfesta aðgerðir til efnahagslegs mismunar. Háskólanám, sem hafa notið góðs af staðfestum aðgerðum, hefur einnig sagt að þau hafi fengið betri störf, unnið sér inn meiri peninga og lifir betur vegna þess tækifæris sem þau fengu með staðfestum aðgerðum.<br/>Styðja við verulegan mikilvægi þess að bregðast við og íhuga framlög sín til að auka bæði háskólanám og samfélag almennt. Hins vegar telja andstæðingar staðfestra aðgerða að tíminn sé kominn til að binda enda á ögrandi aðgerð.Reyndar telja að þeir hafi verið skapaðir til að tryggja sanngjarna inntökuhætti til að breyta til lengri tíma kynþáttamisréttis.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Samsetningar<br/><br/>Samsetningir eru varnar gegn kýla, danskir viðbrögð við mismunandi tegundir árása.Þeir hafa mörg nöfn yfir bardagalistir en (í minni reynslu) hvert list hefur einhverja útgáfu af þeim. Þetta gerir þá öðruvísi en form því það eru fullt af bardagalistum sem hafa engin form. Hvað gerir það samstarfsæfingar svo alhliða? Af hverju að æfa sérstaka svörun þegar (í raun) tímasetningu, tegund árás, stærð árásarmanna og hundrað aðrir þættir munu gera það svo þú notir aldrei að allt danskir viðbrögð? Og að lokum, hvernig getum við æfa fyrir alvöru varnarástand og forðast meiðsli á sama tíma?<br/><br/>The alhliða samsetning er áhrifamikill, til að segja minnst. stíl okkar á Kenpo karate hefur lista yfir 108 sprengjur sem hægt er að læra. (flestir nemendur læra aðeins 20-30 þó) Í Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu þú eyðir heilum flokkum æfa armar og karókí, læra hvert lúmskur á hreyfingu meðan félagi þinn býður upp á litla mótstöðu. Sérhver Boxer hefur eytt klukkustundum fyrir framan poka og/eða spegil að henda sömu samsetningu af höggum þar til líkami þeirra færist með því að hugsa um einn. Samsetningir eru alhliða vegna þess að við höfum enga betri leið til að kynna hreyfingu og æfa síðan lúmsku stöður sem þarf til að gera þær virka. Með því að slá lítið þrýstipunkt í gegnum fatnað tekur A-flotinn á æfingu, með því að ná armbar með stjórn krefst þess að vera vandlega sett hip- og sneaky skipulag og frábær samsetning er aðeins gagnlegt ef þú getur í gegnum hann frá jafnvægi og verndaðri stöðu. Getur þú hugsað þér betri leið til að öðlast þessa færni?<br/><br/>Það eru nokkrir þættir sem ákvarða hvernig þú bregst við árás og hvort í sparri leik eða í baráttunni, ég hef ALDREI notað fulla samsetningu í vörn minni. Við ræktum þessi danskra manna viðbrögð vegna þess að markmiðið er ekki að draga saman 8 úr hvert skipti sem þú sérð krókur kýla en til að sýna þér leið til að hindra það og þá mögulega leið til að fylgja því upp. Ég hef aldrei valið að nota samsetningu 3 í raunveruleikaástandi en blokkin er ein af mínum go-til að flytja.Samsetningar bæta við verkfærum sem þeir laga ekki bílinn.<br/><br/>Síðasti spurningin er öryggisspurning.Ef við ægjum fyrir veruleikanum þurfum við að endurtaka raunveruleikann.Hvernig getum við komið í veg fyrir meiðsli á meðan við gerum það? Hvenær kemur niður á það, þá snýst þetta um að byggja upp traust. Við byrjum hægar og lærum að treysta því að við höfum stjórn á sjálfum okkur. Við lærum líka að treysta samstarfsaðilum okkar að hafa stjórn á því. Í meiri tíma lærum við að treysta stjórn okkar á maka okkar og (lítil hræri) við lærum að treysta okkar stjórn yfir okkur. Að lokum (með fullt af æfingu) er hægt að færa fullt hraði, kasta maka þínum, og vera kastað án ótta við meiðsli.<br/><br/>Samsetningar eru almennar af ástæðu; þær eru stundaðar svo þær geta verið fjarlægðar inn í sinn hluta og við erum óhuldar með því að stofna rólega og byggja upp traust. Eins og með allt annað í bardagalistir, hafa samsetningar margar ástæður á bak við framkvæmd þeirra og framkvæmd. |
