| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote.

Þess vegna gaf Section 2 af 15. yfirlýsingunni „valdið til að framfylgja þessari grein með viðeigandi löggjöf“.<br/><br/>Og reyndar gat þorskað tungumál kosningaréttar ekki náð því sem þingsályktunarþingið og Thomas Jefferson gat ekki. Lög um borgaraleg réttindi frá 1964 og kosningarétt – og borgaraleg réttindi hreyfing sem þau komu fram – þjónaði sem hvati fyrir róttækan aukningu í tækifæri svarta Bandaríkjamanna til að taka þátt í lýðræðisferlinu.<br/><br/>Til dæmis voru aðeins 6,7 prósent af hæfum svörtum Mississippis skráð til atkvæðagreiðslu frá 1962; af 1969 sem tala hafði náð 66.5 prósentum.Í dag hefur Mississippi meira svarta embættismönnum en nokkru öðru ríki.<br/><br/>Friðslagið sem kosningarétturinn setti var lengi ofsóttur þegar hann var liðinn, fulltrúi harðlega baráttunnar við þau. En ólíklegt er að þessar verndir séu nú undir árás, sem hættu að framfarir þjóðar okkar virkaði svo erfitt að ná.<br/><br/>Á síðasta ári, þegar Shelby County v.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Sérfræðingur í verndun persónuupplýsinga Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. júní 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Mynd: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>Forseti Miðstöðvar Barnaverndar við Landbúnaðarháskólann í Róm, og var hann meðlimur í stjórnarformennsku minni, Fr Hans Zollner SJ í Ástralíu árið 2018 til að tala við leiðtoga og þolendur kaþólskra yfirvalda.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh frá Jesuit Communications settist niður með honum í heimsókn til að kanna hvernig kirkjan er að bregðast við misnotkunarkreppu á alþjóðavettvangi, og hvað hægt er að læra af reynslu okkar í Ástralíu.<br/><br/>MM: Þetta er þriðja ferð þín til Ástralíu.Þú hefur heimsótt nokkur önnur lönd til að sjá hvernig kirkjan er að bregðast við ofbeldi um allan heim.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Ég skil, eftir að hafa heimsótt um 50 lönd á fimm eða sex heimsálfum, er að kirkjan er í raun farin að færa yfir síðustu tvö ár um málefni réttlætis til þeirra, hlusta á þá og gera hvað sem hægt er að gera með tilliti til verndar.<br/><br/>Ég var hjá Jesuit héraðsstjórnum í allri Afríku í lok apríl og er forseti Jesuits aðstoða Afríku og Madagaskar mjög velþóknanlegt og tileinkað því. Hann hefur sett upp ítarlega aðgerðaáætlun fyrir myndun og til að kynna leiðbeiningar um allan heim. Það er mjög til skoðunar og mjög vísvitandi átak til að gera hvað sem er hægt að gera til að stunda á fyrirbyggjandi hátt sem Jesuits í Afríku — á heimsálfu þar til fyrir nokkrum árum var þettalent tungumál.<br/><br/>Ein af þeim áskorunum sem reyna að þróa þessa hnattrænu nálgun er að þú ert að takast á við svo marga menningarheima og svo margir mismunandi skilninga. Hvernig færir þú þetta saman og reyni að veita fræðslu og styrkja trúfélög sem glíma við þessi mál?<br/><br/>Þetta er ein helsta spurningin sem við höfum, ég held að það sem ég get gert sé að örva umræðu, örva íhugun og undirbúa fólk eins mikið og mögulegt er svo að það geti gert jarðvinnuna.<br/><br/>Miðstöð barnaverndar við Landbúnaðarháskólann telur ekki hafa viðbrögð við öllum spurningum. Ekki aðeins vegna þess að við vitum ekki sérstakt samhengi — við gætum vitað nokkrar af þeim, en við erum að tala um þúsundir menningarheima, við erum að tala um hundruð tungumál, við erum að tala um mjög fjölbreytt lagalegur bakgrunnur. Það er mismunandi jafnvel stundum í einu landi, eins og Ástralíu þar sem þú hefur ríki innan Samveldislandsins í Ástralíu sem hafa mismunandi lög en önnur ríki.<br/><br/>Ég er einhver sem reynir að sporna við og örva umræður og íhugun. Ég er líka mjög ánægður með að hlusta á fólk.<br/><br/>Þú hefur minnst á þörfina á að hlusta og styðja fórnarlömbum í að heyra.Við höfum augljóslega haft konungsráð hér í Ástralíu, en hver eru nokkrar aðrar leiðir til að þú hafir séð að raddir fórnarlömbum séu studd um allan heim?<br/><br/>Í Frakklandi er einn diskur sem hefur staðfest hvað þeir kalla "The Listen Space". Þar geta fórnarlömb komið fram og þeir geta tjáð sig. biskupinn er til staðar. Það er opið rými þar sem fólk sem hefur verið sárt mikið er frjáls að minnsta kosti að tjá það sem þeir vilja spyrja frá kirkjunni leiðtoga o.s.frv.<br/><br/>Það eru aðrir staðir í Bandaríkjunum eða í öðrum löndum þar sem fórnarlömbum hefur verið boðið af sjúkdómum, af sýslumönnum, með forystu kirkjunnar, að koma fram. Ég verð að segja að í heildina held ég að það sé góð vilja, og það eru fleiri fólk eins og biskup og sveitir sem hlusta á fórnarlömb en við vitum. En það er enginn líkan af því að gefa fórnarlömbum ekki aðeins pláss til að tjá sig og hlusta á, heldur einnig til að taka virkan þátt í kirkjunni þróun.<br/><br/>Hvað varðar að setja upp rými fyrir stuðning við fórnarlömb, hvað eru hluti af því sem þú hefur séð sem gæti raunverulega hjálpað - og að við gætum verið að íhuga hér í Ástralíu?<br/><br/>Eitt af helstu atriðum sem margir fórnarlömbum koma fram er: Getum við ekki verið með, innan flokkastillinga, reglulegt samtal við það sem felur í sér þolendur ofbeldis sem reglulegir meðlimir í nefnd, hljómandi stjórn, endurgjöfarhópur eða eitthvað svona? Svo að þessi rödd sé ekki aðeins fært inn í tiltekið tækifæri, eða þar sem maður finnst hann vera fær um að tala um það, heldur er það heyrt um það reglulega – byggja þá rödd inn í kerfið.<br/><br/>Það mun hjálpa okkur öllum, það mun hjálpa þolendum og fórnarlömbum vegna þess að þeir munu líða vel og kunna vel við tiltekna lífsáskorana, að þeir hafi farið í gegnum. Í öðru lagi mun það hjálpa samfélaginu að miklu leyti, vegna þess að við getum að minnsta kosti gert okkur viðkvæmari fyrir því sem áhyggjur og sérstakar þarfir þolendur eru — sem geta líka talað við þarfir ungs fólks.<br/><br/>M: Við höfum sterka hópa af þolendum hér í Ástralíu sem hafa getað stutt hvert annað í gegnum það ferli. En hvað þú ert að segja er að við þurfum nokkrar leiðir til að styðja þá hópa og styðja þá, í gegnum okkar eigin stofnanir líka?<br/><br/>Og ég held að við þurfum að vera skapandi, það mun vinna fyrir einn skóla og einn sókn og einn diskur á einn hátt, og fyrir aðra á annan hátt. Vegna þess að eftirlifandi þeirra sem ég er í stöðugum samskiptum hafa þeir alveg svipaðar beiðnir og svipuð reynslu varðandi móttöku í kirkjunni eða ekki — tilfinning kastað út eða rifin. En þeir hafa líka mjög mismunandi væntingar, svo ég hef lært að þú hefur einnig til að vera mjög í að taka á sig muninn í því sem þessi tiltekna hópur, eða þessi tiltekna lifun, vill, beiðnir og þarfir.<br/><br/>M: Survivers tala um að vilja fá sögur sínar heyrt og viðurkenndar. Við höfum haft Royal Commission hér í Ástralíu, sem veitti sjálfstæða ferli þar sem fórnarlömb gætu farið fram. Er þörf fyrir eitthvað þannig að hvað varðar sannleikann, réttlæti og sáttargjörð fyrir kirkjuna á alþjóðavettvangi?<br/><br/>H: Já, ég held að það sé þörf fyrir það á alþjóðavettvangi, en ég held fyrst hvert heimakirkja þarf að gera sitt eigið heimili. Ég sé ekki að gerast mjög fljótlega að sumir slík ráð eða þóknun yrði stofnuð til að líta inn á þetta svæði fyrir allt kirkjuna. Kirkjan hefur aðild að 1,3 milljarða manna og er til staðar í 190 löndum og hefur alls kyns ágreining um andlega, andlegan og fjárhagslegan stuðning.<br/><br/>Það er eitt sem ég hef rekist stöðugt á í samskiptum við, unnið með og hlustað á fórnarlömbum og það er að þeir vilja hlusta á. Þannig að ef það væri tilfinning að fórnarlömb væru stöðugt hlustuð á – í Róm og annars staðar — held ég að það myndi veita mörgum fórnarlömbum.<br/><br/>Ég held að [Pope Francis'] áhyggjum, sérstaklega varðandi spurninguna þína, sé að staðbundnar kirkjur gera það sem þeir geta svo að fórnarlömbum verði hlustað á í því tiltekna landi. Ég hef lista yfir fólk sem vill tala við heilaga föðurinn beint og líkamlega það er ómögulegt. Ég var til staðar árið 2014 til að þýða fyrir tvo þýska þolendur sem voru valdir með tveimur írskum og tveimur enskum eftirlifandi þegar hann fékk sex þeirra heima. Fyrir hvern var hann þarna í 40 til 45 mínútur. Var hann að gera þetta fyrir hvern eftirmann sem hann gat ekki sofið lengur.<br/><br/>Fordæmi hans er endurskipulagt fyrir alla kaþólsku kirkjuna þannig að fórnarlömbum og þolendum er fagnað og hlustað á. Ég held að ef biskupinn og sveitarfélögin í þessum heimi, í öllum löndum, fylgdu dæmi hans, væru margir eftirlifandi mjög vel þegnar þess.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin var nýlega vitnað rétt fyrir heimsfundanefnd, sem segir að það sé of lítið þar sem það er nú sett upp til að ná því sem það þarf til að ná því. Þarf kirkjan að setja meiri auðlindir inn í hvernig það er að hafa umsjón með þessum málum?<br/><br/>Í augnablikinu erum við 16 meðlimir frá í rauninni öllum heimsálfum og helstu tungumálahópum. Við erum fulltrúar margvíslegra fræðimanna og starfsgreina og markmiðanefndar — þar sem þau lög sem bara hafa verið kunngerð — er að veita heilögum föður ráðgjöf.<br/><br/>Algengur misskilningur um umboðið er fyrst og fremst sá að við takast á við mál af ásetningum. Það er ekki raunin. Við höfum enga lögsögu eða stjórnvaldsvald hvað varðar mál, vegna þess að þegar kemur að ásakanir um misnotkun og háttsemi eru settar.<br/><br/>Önnur misskilningur er að við kynnumst beint, hluti á jörðu. Fyrsta og fremst markmið okkar er að við ráðleggjum heilögum föður um málefni.<br/><br/>Svo frá sjónarhóli mínum, já, við þurfum að fjárfesta meira. En við þurfum að fjárfesta meira á svæðisstigi og við þurfum að ganga úr skugga um að tillögurnar frá Pontical Commission séu sendar til heilaga föðurins — sem venjulega forseti gerir — og þá er eftirfylgniferli sem endurspeglar það sem við höfum gefið ráð okkar.<br/><br/>Í Ástralíu hafa kaþólskir fagaðilar takmarkaðar umsjón með viðbrögðum kirkjunnar og veitt leiðbeiningar og stuðning til að tryggja að allar stofnanir í kirkjunni séu barnaöryggisstofnanir. Er þörf fyrir einhvers konar skipulagsstuðning frá Róm fyrir þá biskupa og diska sem erfitt er að mynda þessar stofnanir og veita vernd í þessum diskum?<br/><br/>Ég held að verkefnið muni að lokum þróast í þeirri línu og þau eru nú í því ferli að ráða sérfræðinga á þeim sviðum.<br/><br/>Ég held að kirkjan þurfi að skilja að kirkjan getur lært hvert af öðru gagnkvæmum og skilningur minn hefur alltaf verið – og ég held að heilagur faðir minn hafi minnt okkur — að kirkjan muni ekki virka sem miðlægt fyrirtæki. Það virkar ekki eins og það, á áhrifaríkan hátt. Sérhver biskup, sérhver biskuparáðstefna, hefur, að nokkru leyti, líf hennar á eigin spýtur. Það sem við þurfum að læra meira er að opna rás samskipta.<br/><br/>Það eru nokkrir hlutir sem menn kenna um ofbeldi í kirkjunni. Sem prestur og sálfræðingur, og eins og einhver sem hefur hitt og unnið með þolendum, hver eru hugsanir þínar um það mál?<br/><br/>Ég held að spurningin þar sem ofbeldi kemur frá er mikilvægasta og páfinn hefur fjallað um það í bréfi sínu til Guðs sem birtist 20. ágúst. Hann segir í fyrsta lagi og endurtekur það aftur og aftur, að spurningin um kynferðislega misnotkun sé alltaf tengd — eða næstum alltaf tengd — ekki aðeins við spurningu um misnotkun valds heldur einnig um misnotkun samviskunnar.<br/><br/>Svo er alvöru grundvallarspurningin um misnotkun miklu flóknari en bara [spurningin um kynhneigð] — hvort sem hún er gagnkynhneigð eða samkynhneigð. Það er aflvandamál, og það verðum við að virkilega vinna að því hvernig við skiljum prestdóminn, hvernig við skiljum biskup, hvernig við skiljum okkur og lifum sambandið? Hver eru mörkin?<br/><br/>Þess vegna er ég mjög ánægður með að Jesuit hérað í Ástralíu sé að koma á fót siðareglum. Vegna þess að við tölum ekki aðeins um kynferðislega misnotkun á börnum. Við tölum um kynferðislegt misnotkun fullorðinna og við tölum um misnotkun á öðrum leiðum — eins og misnotkun samviskunnar, þar sem þú segir einhverjum hvað þú hugsar, eða þú trúir Guði, og þú getur sagt öðrum: Þú þarft að gera það, gegn samvisku viðkomandi.<br/><br/>Margir halda að hátíðin sé misnotað. Eins og ég segi er alltaf að hátíðin sem slík er ekki til vegna misnotkunar — annars hvernig við útskýrum að 99,9 prósent allra misnotara líf og hvernig getum við útskýrt að 95 eða 96 prósent allra presta misnota ekki börn? En, töff eða heit af chastity, það er í raun ekki samþætt, það er í raun ekki lifað almennilega — já, sem framleiðir vandamál. Stundum taka fólk að drekka, stundum taka þeir að sér fjárhættuspil, og stundum taka þeir að sér kynferðislega misferli, með fullorðnum og með börn.<br/><br/>Hvernig eigum við að takast á við þá hugmynd að trúarlegum andlegum mætti sem prestarnir og biskupar eru fjárfestir? Hvernig geta guðfræði hjálpað okkur að skilja, og kannski hvernig getur félagsfræði, sálfræði eða viðskiptafræði hjálpað okkur að skilgreina takmörkin sem tengjast orku og nauðsyn þess að halda takmörkum þínum |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Ég er ekki hissa á þessum mistökum. Í raun myndi ég jafnvel fara svona langt til að segja þetta er ekki eitthvað sem mun breytast, né ætti að fá allt gufuð upp um að breyta því. Á 10 árum munum við enn hafa blæðingarbrúnir, flókin atriði í stærstu áhyggjulistanum og það sem við erum loksins að komast í kringum til að skilja verður stærsti hluti eyðslu okkar.<br/><br/>Nú, Gunnar og Andy bæði hafa framúrskarandi stig, sérstaklega um upplýsingatækniteymi sem sjá vandamál og leysa þau með upplýsingatæknilausnum; í raun er ég jákvæður punktar þeirra hafa verðleika.<br/><br/>En ég held að það séu aðrar hugmyndir sem trompet þær (ég gerði athugasemd á bloggunum sínum um það og síðar ákvað ég að bara blogga hér).<br/><br/>við óttum nýja hluti vegna þess að við skiljum þau ekki, eða skilja þau ekki vegna þess að þau eru ný.<br/><br/>þeir eru of nýir fyrir okkur að hafa solid aðferðir til að meðhöndla þá.<br/><br/>þeir eru of nýir fyrir okkur að vita hvort við ættum að hafa áhyggjur eða ekki! við höfum tilhneigingu til að sjálfgefið að paranoid/borið, sem er gott!<br/><br/>of nýr til að hafa augljósan fjárhagsáætlun hluti úthlutað þeim. Get ég keypt kassa eða hugbúnað sem veitir "skýjaöryggi" eða "öryggi samfélagsmiðla?"<br/><br/>þeir eru svo nýr fyrirtækið veit ekki einu sinni hvernig á að nota þá eða hvað þeir vilja af þeim, hvað við getum tryggt þá á meðan við hittumst eða að minnsta kosti ekki að hætta öllum viðskiptaþörfum. Ef fyrirtækið veit ekki einu sinni hvernig á að nota þau ennþá er ég ekki viss um að öryggi sé í hvaða stöðu sem er til að leiðbeina þeirri notkun á öruggan hátt.<br/><br/>Það skal einnig tekið fram að þessir nýju hlutir eru að miklu leyti ýtt í neytendalandið og inn í fyrirtækið, með upplýsingatækni sem einhvers konar, "Ó já", hugsun. Firewalls, AV, AM, Ath eru öll upplýsingatækni svör við yfirleitt upplýsingatæknimálum. Auðvitað er munur á því. Þeir eru líka mjög huglæg atriði, í stað mjög hlutlægra atriða eins og eldveggja, þekktra illgjarnra bita, hegðunar, undirskrifta, porta. Viðskipti birta mjög flókin mál sem eru oft að fela fólk (sem við getum ekki sett á) og það passar oft vel í teppi reglur. Jafnvel þótt við snúum okkur frá tæknilegum lausnum og varið tíma okkar í að leysa þessi vandamál, þá eru þeir enn ekki að fara að leysa þessi vandamál snyrtilega. Sömuleiðis, þegar ýta á kemur að troðningi, geturðu haft og mætt markmiðum með eldveggi? Getur þú sýnt fram á að bæta? Allt þetta flæðir úr frekar huglægum þáttum þeirra sem ekki eru tæknilegir. Raða af munnum á milli skýrslukorts barns og svörunar sem þú færð frá foreldrakennarafundi. Ef þú átt barn, sem maður vildi vera bundinn við eða ekki endilega trúa? (Svarin er viðfangsefnið eitt!)<br/><br/>Það gæti verið sagt að þetta sé náttúrulegt eftirlit með öryggi og tækni: allt frá því að taka tæknilegu eftirliti til að færa upp staflann í átt að hegðun og fólki. Jú, þessi 3 efstu áhyggjur er hægt að segja að kýla í gegnum eldveggi og nethluta, en það er eðli þeirra (félagsmiðlar "kúfa" í gegnum eldvegg er langt öðruvísi en ég gata í gegnum SSH tengingu að brú heimaneti; samfélagsmiðlar mínir eru aftur á *vegur* Ég nota SSH tenginguna mína eftir að haldið er í bið vegna þess að það er þegar þörf; þ.e. samfélagsmiðlun er leiðin höfn 80 er notuð.)<br/><br/>Í grundvallaratriðum benda allar vísbendingar til þess að ekki sé hissa á þessu dichotomy.Og ég held ekki að þetta sé nokkur frekari vísbending um að upplýsingatækni/öryggi sé að gera það rangt, eða sé ekki í samræmi við viðskipti, eða hefur tæknilega dökk-miðlara-herbergi bakgrunn. Ég er ekki að segja að við erum að gera hlutina rétt eða við erum rétt stillt, en ofangreint er ekki góð rök til að styðja kenningu þessara galla.<br/><br/>Nú fyrir mjög stóra stökk, vil ég líkja við núverandi aukningu í farsíma tölvu til að vera eins stór og kynning á tölvum í viðskipti og síðar PC/netið í viðskipti. Nú, ég var ekki í kring þegar fyrrverandi gerðist, né var ég í greininni þegar einkatölvubyltingin var færð í viðskipti, en ég myndi veðja á það er næsti samanburður svo langt að ég gæti jafnvel sagt það sama fyrir samfélagsmiðla. Þetta eru fordregnar nýjar og þær eru stórar breytingar sem hafa verið gerðar út fyrir Macs eða nýjan hugbúnað eða eitthvað nýtt viðskiptaferli. |
