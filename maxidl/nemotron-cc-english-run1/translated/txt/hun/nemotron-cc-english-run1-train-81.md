| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Negyvenkilenc évvel ezelőtt Lyndon B. Johnson elnök aláírta az 1965-ös választójogi törvényt.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Közel egy évszázaddal ezelőtt az alkotmány 15. kiegészítése kijelentette: "Az Egyesült Államok polgárainak szavazati jogát sem az Egyesült Államok, sem bármely más állam nem tagadhatja meg vagy rövidítheti le faji, színbeli vagy korábbi szolgasági állapot miatt." És közel egy évszázaddal ezelőtt, nemzetünk alapító atyái elindították az amerikai demokrácia nagy kísérletét, kijelentve, hogy "minden ember egyenlő."<br/><br/>Az 1965-ös szavazati jogokról szóló törvény megkésett elismerése volt annak, hogy még Amerikában is alapvető eszményeinknek kevés súlya van, ha nem védi őket a jogállamiság. Ezért a 15. módosítás 2. szakasza megadta a Kongresszusnak a jogot, hogy "megfelelő jogszabályokkal érvényesítse ezt a cikket."<br/><br/>És valóban, a szavazati jogokról szóló törvény kodifikált nyelvezete képes volt elérni azt, amit a rekonstrukciós korszak kongresszusa és Thomas Jefferson nem tudott. Az 1964-es polgárjogi törvény és a választójogi törvény - és a polgárjogi mozgalom, amelyből kiemelkedtek - katalizátorként szolgált a fekete amerikaiak számára a demokratikus folyamatban való részvétel lehetőségének drámai növekedéséhez.<br/><br/>Például 1962-ben a fekete mississippieknek csak 6,7 százaléka volt regisztrálva a szavazásra; 1969-re ez a szám elérte a 66,5 százalékot. Ma Mississippinek több fekete választott tisztviselője van, mint bármely más államnak.<br/><br/>A szavazati jogokról szóló törvény által bevezetett védelem már régen esedékes volt, amikor elfogadták őket, ami azt a nehéz küzdelmet képviseli, amellyel elérték őket. De elképzelhetetlen, hogy ezek a védelem most támadás alatt áll, veszélyeztetve a haladást, amiért nemzetünk olyan keményen dolgozott.<br/><br/>Tavaly a Shelby County kontra Holder ügyben az Egyesült Államok Legfelsőbb Bírósága kibelezte a szavazati jogokról szóló törvény egyik kulcsfontosságú elemét, amely lehetővé tette a korábbi szövetségi felülvizsgálatot, hogy biztosítsa a megkülönböztetésmentességet, mielőtt bármilyen új szavazási törvény hatályba lépne.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Sajnos a republikánus vezetők válasza az volt, hogy semmit sem tesznek. Ted Cruz szenátor és Rick Perry kormányzó mindent megtettek, hogy dicsérjék a Legfelsőbb Bíróság döntését. Rand Paul szenátor elutasította a szavazási jogokról szóló törvény folyamatos szükségességét azzal, hogy megjegyezte: "Van egy afroamerikai elnökünk."<br/><br/>Bár Barack Obama megválasztása valóban történelmi mérföldkő volt, veszélyes azt gondolni, hogy felment bennünket attól, hogy éberek maradjunk nemzetünk múltjának elhúzódó következményeivel szemben. Az a sietség, amellyel az államok a szavazási korlátozások életbe léptetésére léptek, megerősíti, hogy a 4. szakasz által bevezetett védelem még mindig szükséges.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>A republikánus kormányzók szigorú fotóazonosítási korlátozásokat írtak alá a törvénybe, mint a megoldás a szavazók megszemélyesítésének gyakorlatilag nem létező problémájára, amely aránytalanul sújtja a nőket, a fiatalokat, a dolgozó családokat és az afroamerikai közösséget. Az olyan republikánusok, mint Paul, hamisan keresik ezeknek a közösségeknek a szavazatait, amikor úgy vélik, hogy "nincs semmi baj" olyan korlátozások bevezetésével, amelyek megnehezítik ezeknek a választókerületeknek a szavazását.<br/><br/>A republikánusok arra is törekedtek, hogy korlátozzák a korai szavazási időszakokat, beleértve a vasárnapot a választás napja előtt, amikor az afroamerikai egyházak nagy sikereket értek el a Souls to the Polls programokkal.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Ezek a korlátozások a republikánusok érzéketlen erőfeszítését jelentik, hogy a szavazást megnehezítsék, szűk, rövid távú politikai számítások alapján, hogy a republikánusok megnyerhetik a választásokat a választók méretének csökkentésével.<br/><br/>A demokratáknak egészen más a küldetésük, amikor a szavazásról van szó: biztosítani kell, hogy minden jogosult szavazó regisztrálhasson, hogy minden regisztrált szavazó szavazhasson, és hogy minden szavazatot pontosan megszámoljanak.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>A Demokrata Nemzeti Bizottság szavazói expanziós projektje tükrözi azt a meggyőződésünket, hogy a nagyobb részvétel erősíti nemzetünket és demokráciánkat. Továbbra is felhasználjuk páratlan intézményi tudásunkat, hogy megvédjük a szavazati jogokat a törvényekkel és taktikákkal szemben, amelyek megpróbálnák elnyomni a szavazást. És mivel a legjobb védekezés a támadás, azon is dolgozunk, hogy kiterjesszük a szavazást azáltal, hogy felhasználjuk a technológiánkat és az adatforrásainkat, hogy új szavazókat regisztráljunk.<br/><br/>Ezen az évfordulón az egyik legjobb módja annak, hogy tisztelegjünk azok előtt, akik küzdöttek - és egyes esetekben az életüket adták - a törvény elfogadása a republikánusok számára a kongresszusban, hogy csatlakozzanak a demokratákhoz a szavazati jogok módosításáról szóló törvény elfogadásában, hogy visszaállítsa az 1965-ös szavazati jogokról szóló törvény ígéretét.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, demokrata, Florida 23. kongresszusi körzetét képviseli az Egyesült Államok Kongresszusában. 2011 óta a Demokratikus Nemzeti Bizottság elnöke. Kövesse őt a Twitteren.<br/><br/>A The Root célja, hogy elősegítse és előmozdítsa a beszélgetéseket a fekete diaszpóra szempontjából releváns kérdésekről, különféle vélemények bemutatásával minden szempontból, függetlenül attól, hogy ezeket a véleményeket szerkesztői munkatársaink osztják-e vagy sem. |
| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Kérdések és válaszok: Vatican protection expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>2021. június 13.<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ. atya. Kép: Ausztrál jezsuiták.<br/><br/>A római Gregorián Egyetem Gyermekvédelmi Központjának elnöke és a kiskorúak védelmével foglalkozó pápai bizottság tagja, Hans Zollner SJ atya 2018-ban Ausztráliában volt, hogy beszéljen a katolikus minisztérium vezetőivel és túlélőivel.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh, a Jezsuita Kommunikáció munkatársa leült vele a látogatás során, hogy megvizsgálja, hogyan reagál az egyház a nemzetközi visszaélési válságra, és mit tanulhatunk az ausztráliai tapasztalatainkból.<br/><br/>MM: Ez már a harmadik ausztráliai útja. Jó néhány más országot is meglátogatott, hogy lássa, hogyan reagál az egyház a visszaélésekre szerte a világon. Tudna nekünk némi képet adni arról, hogyan néz ki a globális kép?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Úgy tudom, hogy miután öt vagy hat kontinens mintegy 50 országában jártam, az Egyház az elmúlt években valóban elkezdett az áldozatoknak igazságot szolgáltatni, meghallgatni őket, és mindent megtenni a védelem érdekében.<br/><br/>Április végén az egész afrikai jezsuita tartománybeliekkel voltam, és az afrikai és madagaszkári jezsuita asszisztátus elnöke nagyon elkötelezett és elkötelezett. Alapos cselekvési tervet dolgozott ki a képzésre és az iránymutatások bevezetésére. Ez egy nagyon figyelmes és nagyon megfontolt erőfeszítés, hogy mindent megtegyünk, amit csak lehet, hogy proaktívan elkötelezzük magunkat, mint jezsuiták Afrikában - egy olyan kontinensen, ahol néhány évvel ezelőttig mindez idegen nyelv volt.<br/><br/>Ennek a globális megközelítésnek a kifejlesztésének egyik kihívása az, hogy olyan sok kultúrával és sok különböző megértéssel van dolgunk. Hogyan lehet ezt összehozni, és megpróbálni képzést és támogatást nyújtani az e kérdésekkel foglalkozó vallási közösségeknek?<br/><br/>Ez az egyik legfontosabb kérdésünk. Azt hiszem, amit tehetek az az, hogy ösztönözöm a vitát, ösztönözöm a gondolkodást, és felkészítem az embereket, amennyire csak lehetséges, hogy elvégezhessék az alapmunkát.<br/><br/>A Gregorián Egyetem Gyermekvédelmi Központja nem tesz úgy, mintha minden kérdésre lenne válasza. Nemcsak azért, mert nem ismerjük a konkrét összefüggéseket – talán ismerünk néhányat közülük, hanem több ezer kultúráról beszélünk, több száz nyelvről beszélünk, nagyon változatos jogi háttérről beszélünk. Ez néha egy országon belül is változik, például Ausztráliában, ahol az Ausztrál Nemzetközösségen belül vannak olyan államok, amelyek más törvényekkel rendelkeznek, mint más államok.<br/><br/>Olyan ember vagyok, aki megpróbálja felkelteni és ösztönözni a beszélgetést és a gondolkodást. Nagyon örülök az embereknek is.<br/><br/>Említette, hogy meg kell hallgatni és támogatni kell az áldozatokat a meghallgatásban. Nyilvánvalóan itt van Ausztráliában a királyi bizottság, de mi más módon látta, hogy az áldozatok hangját világszerte támogatják?<br/><br/>Franciaországban van egy egyházmegye, amely létrehozta azt, amit "Hallgatótérnek" neveznek. Ott az áldozatok előléphetnek, és kifejezhetik magukat. A püspök jelen van. Ez egy nyitott tér, ahol a súlyosan megbántott emberek szabadon kifejezhetik azt, amit az egyházi vezetéstől kérnek.<br/><br/>Vannak más helyek is az USA-ban vagy más országokban, ahová egyházmegyék, tartományok, az egyház vezetése hívta az áldozatokat, hogy jelentkezzenek. Azt kell mondanom, hogy összességében úgy gondolom, hogy van egy jó szándék, és több olyan ember van, mint a püspökök és a tartományiak, akik meghallgatják az áldozatokat, mint tudjuk. Nincs azonban olyan modell, amely nemcsak teret adna az áldozatoknak arra, hogy kifejezzék magukat és meghallgassák őket, hanem arra is, hogy tevékenyen részt vegyenek az egyház fejlődésében.<br/><br/>Ami az áldozatok támogatására szolgáló helyeket illeti, milyen dolgokat láthattak, amelyek valóban segíthetnek - és hogy fontolóra vehetjük itt Ausztráliában?<br/><br/>Az egyik legfontosabb pont, amit sok áldozat felhoz, az, hogy "Nem lehet, hogy plébániai környezetben, iskolai környezetben, rendszeres beszélgetés folyik, amely magában foglalja a visszaélések túlélőit, mint egy bizottság, egy bizottság, egy vizsgálóbizottság, egy visszacsatoló csoport vagy valami ilyesmi?" Tehát ez a hang nem csak egy adott alkalomra érkezik, vagy amikor egy személy úgy érzi, hogy képes beszélni róla, hanem rendszeresen - építse be ezt a hangot a rendszerbe.<br/><br/>Ez mindannyiunknak segíteni fog. Segíti a túlélőket és az áldozatokat, mert szívesen látják és értékelik őket a konkrét tapasztalatokban és az élet kihívásaiban, amelyeken keresztülmentek. Másodsorban a közösség egészét fogja segíteni, mert legalább egyre érzékenyebbé tehetjük magunkat a túlélők aggodalmaira és sajátos szükségleteire, amelyek a fiatalok szükségleteire is kiterjedhetnek.<br/><br/>M: Erős túlélőkből álló csoportunk van itt Ausztráliában, akik képesek voltak egymást támogatni ebben a folyamatban. De azt mondja, hogy valamilyen módon támogatnunk kell ezeket a csoportokat, és támogatnunk ezeket az embereket, a saját intézményeinken keresztül is?<br/><br/>És azt hiszem, kreatívnak kell lennünk. Egy iskolában, egy plébánián és egy egyházmegyében működik egy módon, és mások számára egy másik módon. Mivel a túlélők, akikkel állandó kapcsolatban vagyok, nagyon hasonló kérésekkel és hasonló tapasztalatokkal rendelkeznek az egyházban való befogadással kapcsolatban, vagy sem – úgy érzik, hogy kidobták vagy elbocsátották őket. De ők maguk is egészen más elvárásokat támasztanak. Tehát megtanultam, hogy neked is nagyon készségesen el kell fogadnod a különbségeket abban, amit ez a csoport, vagy ez a bizonyos túlélő akar, kér és igényel.<br/><br/>M: A túlélők arról beszélnek, hogy szeretnék, ha a történeteiket meghallgatnák és elismernék. Volt itt Ausztráliában a Királyi Bizottság, amely egy független folyamatot biztosított, ahol az áldozatok előléphetnek. Szükség van-e ilyesmire az igazság, az igazságosság és a kiengesztelődés folyamatában az Egyház számára nemzetközi szinten?<br/><br/>H: Igen, azt hiszem, erre nemzetközi szinten is szükség van. De azt hiszem, először minden helyi gyülekezetnek meg kell csinálnia a saját házi feladatát. Nem hiszem, hogy hamarosan sor kerülne egy ilyen tanács vagy bizottság felállítására, hogy megvizsgálják ezt a területet az egész Egyház számára. Az egyháznak 1,3 milliárd tagja van, és 190 országban van jelen, mindenféle pszichológiai, lelki és pénzügyi várakozással.<br/><br/>Van egy dolog, amivel következetesen találkoztam a kommunikáció, a munka és az áldozatok meghallgatása során, és ez az, hogy azt akarják, hogy meghallgassák őket. Tehát ha úgy éreznénk, hogy az áldozatokat folyamatosan meghallgatják – Rómában és másutt is –, úgy gondolom, hogy ez sok áldozatnak nagy megkönnyebbülést jelentene.<br/><br/>Úgy gondolom, hogy [Ferenc pápa] aggodalmát fejezi ki, különösen az Ön kérdésével kapcsolatban, hogy a helyi egyházak mindent megtesznek annak érdekében, hogy az áldozatokat meghallgassák az adott országban. Van egy listám azokról az emberekről, akik közvetlenül a Szentatyával akarnak beszélni, és fizikailag ez lehetetlen. Ott voltam 2014-ben, hogy fordítsak két német túlélőnek, akiket két ír és két angol túlélővel választottak ki, amikor otthon fogadta őket. Egész reggel hallgatta őket egymás után. 40-45 percig volt ott, és ha ezt tette volna minden túlélővel, nem tudott volna tovább aludni.<br/><br/>Példaképe az egész katolikus egyház számára az áldozatok és a túlélők befogadásának, befogadásának és meghallgatásának módja. Úgy gondolom, hogy ha a püspökök és a provinciálisok ezen a világon, minden országban követnék példáját, sok túlélő igazán nagyra értékelné ezt.<br/><br/>Diarmud Martin érseket nemrég idézték a Családok Világtalálkozója előtt, a Pápai Bizottságról, mondván, hogy túl kicsi, mivel jelenleg úgy van felállítva, hogy elérje, amit el kell érnie. Kell-e az egyháznak több forrást fordítania arra, hogy miként felügyeli ezeket a kérdéseket?<br/><br/>Jelenleg 16 tagunk van, alapvetően minden kontinensről, és a főbb nyelvi csoportokból. Különböző tudományágakat és szakmákat képviselünk, és a bizottság célja – mint ahogy a most kihirdetett törvények is – az, hogy tanácsot adjon a Szentatyának.<br/><br/>A bizottsággal kapcsolatos gyakori félreértés az, hogy először az állításokkal foglalkozunk. Nem ez a helyzet. Nincs jogi vagy adminisztratív hatáskörünk az ügyeket illetően, mert amikor a visszaélésekkel kapcsolatos állításokról van szó, a bíróságok és az eljárás meg van határozva.<br/><br/>A második félreértés az, hogy közvetlenül előmozdítjuk a dolgokat a földön. Az első és legfontosabb célunk az, hogy tanácsot adjunk a Szentatyának a kérdésekben.<br/><br/>Tehát az én szempontomból igen, többet kell beruháznunk. De helyi szinten többet kell beruháznunk, és gondoskodnunk kell arról, hogy a Pápai Bizottság javaslatait továbbítsák a Szentatyának – amit általában az elnök tesz –, és akkor van egy nyomon követési folyamat, amely tükrözi azt, amit tanácsként adtunk.<br/><br/>Ausztráliában a Catholic Professional Standards Limited felügyeli az egyház válaszát, és iránymutatást és támogatást nyújt annak biztosítására, hogy az egyház összes intézménye gyermekbiztos intézmény legyen. Szükség van-e valamiféle szervezeti támogatásra Rómától azoknak a püspököknek és egyházmegyéknek, akik azért küzdenek, hogy megalakítsák ezeket az intézményeket, és védelmet nyújtsanak ezekben az egyházmegyékben?<br/><br/>Úgy gondolom, hogy a bizottság végül is ezen a vonalon fog fejlődni, és most már szakértőket vesznek fel ezeken a területeken.<br/><br/>Azt hiszem, az egyháznak meg kell értenie, hogy a helyi egyházak kölcsönösen tanulhatnak egymástól. És az én megértésem mindig is az volt - és azt hiszem, a Szentatya emlékeztetett minket -, hogy az egyház nem fog központosított vállalatként működni. Ez nem így működik, hatékonyan. Minden püspök, minden püspöki konferencia, bizonyos mértékig, saját életét. Amit meg kell tanulnunk, hogy nyissa meg a csatornákat a kölcsönös kommunikáció.<br/><br/>Számos dolog van, amit az emberek az egyházban elkövetett visszaélésekért hibáztatnak. Papként és pszichológusként, valamint olyan emberként, aki találkozott és dolgozott a túlélőkkel, mit gondol erről a kérdésről?<br/><br/>Úgy gondolom, hogy a legfontosabb kérdés, hogy honnan származik a visszaélés, és a pápa ezt Isten népéhez intézett, augusztus 20-án megjelent levelében fogalmazta meg. Az első bekezdésben azt mondja, és újra és újra megismétli, hogy a szexuális bántalmazás kérdése mindig – vagy majdnem mindig – nem csak a hatalommal való visszaéléshez kapcsolódik, hanem a lelkiismerettel való visszaéléshez is.<br/><br/>Tehát a bántalmazás alapkérdése sokkal összetettebb, mint a szexualitásé – legyen az heteroszexuális vagy homoszexuális. Ez hatalmi kérdés, és ott tényleg azon kell dolgoznunk, hogy hogyan értsük meg a papságot, hogyan értsük meg a püspökséget, hogyan értsük meg és éljük meg a szolgálatainkat? Mik a határok?<br/><br/>Ezért vagyok nagyon boldog, hogy az ausztrál jezsuita tartomány létrehozott egy magatartási kódexet, mert nem csak a kiskorúak szexuális zaklatásáról beszélünk. Beszélünk a felnőttek szexuális bántalmazásáról, és más módon beszélünk a bántalmazásról - például a lelkiismereti visszaélésről, ahol azt diktálod valakinek, amit gondolsz, vagy úgy teszel, mintha tudnád Istenről, és elmondhatod egy másik személynek, hogy "ezt meg kell tenned", annak a személynek a lelkiismerete ellen.<br/><br/>Sokan azt hiszik, hogy a cölibátus visszaélést szül. Mint mindig mondom, a cölibátus önmagában nem ok a visszaélésre – különben hogyan magyarázzuk, hogy az összes bántalmazó 99,9 százaléka nem él cölibátusban, és hogyan magyarázzuk, hogy az összes pap 95 vagy 96 százaléka nem bántalmazza a kiskorúakat? De a cölibátus, vagy a szüzességi fogadalom, ami nem igazán integrált, amit nem igazán megfelelően élnek meg - igen, ez problémát okoz. Néha az emberek isznak, néha szerencsejátékot játszanak, és néha szexuális kötelességszegést követnek el, felnőttekkel és kiskorúakkal.<br/><br/>Az igazi kérdés ezzel kapcsolatban az, hogy hogyan kezeljük a vallási szellemi hatalom fogalmát, amellyel a papok és püspökök foglalkoznak? Hogyan segíthet a teológia megérteni, és hogyan segíthet a szociológia, a pszichológia vagy az üzleti adminisztráció a hatalom határainak meghatározásában, és a határok megtartásának szükségességében? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Nem lep meg ez az eltérés, sőt, még azt is mondhatnám, hogy ez soha nem fog megváltozni, és nem is kellene felizgatnunk magunkat, hogy megváltoztassuk. 10 év múlva még mindig lesz vérző él, összetett tételek a legnagyobb aggodalmak listáján, és a dolgok, amiket végül megértünk, a kiadásaink fő részét képezik.<br/><br/>Gunnarnak és Andynek is kiváló pontjai vannak, különösen az IT-csapatoknak, akik látják az informatikai problémákat és megoldják azokat informatikai megoldásokkal; sőt, biztos vagyok benne, hogy a pontjaik értékesek.<br/><br/>De azt hiszem, vannak más ötletek, hogy adu azokat (Én megjegyzést a blogok róla, és később úgy döntött, én csak blog itt). Ezek a top 3 aggályok vérzésesen új, hogy:<br/><br/>Félünk az új dolgoktól, mert nem értjük őket, vagy nem értjük őket, mert újak.<br/><br/>Túl újak ahhoz, hogy szilárd megközelítéssel kezeljük őket.<br/><br/>túl újak ahhoz, hogy tudjuk, aggódnunk kell-e vagy sem! hajlamosak vagyunk a paranoiára / aggódásra, ami jó!<br/><br/>túl új ahhoz, hogy nyilvánvaló költségvetési tételeket rendeljenek hozzájuk. Vehetek egy dobozt vagy valamilyen szoftvert, amely "felhőbiztonságot" vagy "közösségi médiabiztonságot" biztosít?<br/><br/>Annyira újak, hogy az üzlet nem is tudja, hogyan kell használni őket, vagy mit akarnak tőlük. Nem is beszélve arról, hogyan tudjuk biztosítani őket, miközben még mindig megfelelnek, vagy legalábbis nem tapossák az üzleti igényeket. Ha az üzlet még nem is tudja, hogyan kell használni őket, nem vagyok biztos benne, hogy a biztonság olyan helyzetben van, hogy biztonságosan irányítsa a használatot.<br/><br/>Azt is meg kell említeni, hogy ezek az új dolgok nagyrészt tolt keresztül consumerland és az üzleti, az IT, mint egyfajta, "Oh yeah," gondoltam. Tűzfalak, AV, AM, Auth minden IT válaszok tipikusan informatikai kérdések. Természetesen van különbség. Ezek is nagyon szubjektív kérdések, szemben a nagyon objektív elemekkel, mint a tűzfalak, ismert rosszindulatú bitek, viselkedések, aláírások, portok. Az üzlet nagyon összetett kérdéseket vet fel, amelyek gyakran érintik az embereket (amit nem tudunk kijavítani), és amelyek gyakran nem illeszkednek jól a takaró szabályokba. Még akkor is, ha elfordultunk a technikai megoldásoktól, és az időnket ezeknek a problémáknak a megoldására fordítottuk, még mindig nem lesznek szépen megoldva. Hasonlóképpen, amikor a push jön, tűzfalakkal lehet elérni és elérni a célokat? Tudsz javulást mutatni? Mindez ezeknek a kérdéseknek a meglehetősen szubjektív, nem technikai aspektusából fakad. Ez a különbség a gyermek jelentési kártyája és a szülői-tanári konferencia visszajelzései között. Ha gyereked van, melyikkel lennél a leghajlamosabb nem egyetérteni vagy nem feltétlenül hinni? (A válasz a szubjektív!)<br/><br/>Azt lehet mondani, hogy ez a biztonság és a technológia természetes fejlődése: a technikai vezérlésektől a viselkedés és az emberek felé történő elmozdulásig. Persze, ezek a 3 fő aggályok azt mondhatjuk, hogy átütnek a tűzfalakon és a hálózati szegmenseken, de ezek a dolgok jellege (a közösségi média tűzfalon történő "lyukasztása" messze különbözik attól, mint amikor egy SSH-kapcsolaton keresztül lyukasztok át az otthoni hálózatom áthidalására; a közösségi média hasonlít az SSH-kapcsolathoz, miután a tartást már megütötték, mert szükség van rá; azaz a közösségi média az 80-as portot használják.)<br/><br/>Alapvetően minden jel arra mutat, hogy nem lep meg ez a dichotómia. És nem hiszem, hogy ez további jele annak, hogy az IT / biztonság rosszul csinálja, vagy nem illeszkedik megfelelően az üzlethez, vagy technikai sötét szerver-szoba háttérrel rendelkezik. Nem azt mondom, hogy jól csináljuk a dolgokat, vagy hogy megfelelően igazodunk egymáshoz, de a fentiek nem jó érvek a hiányosságok elméletének alátámasztására.<br/><br/>Most egy igazán nagy ugrás. Szeretném, ha a mobil számítástechnika jelenlegi növekedése olyan nagy lenne, mint a számítógépek bevezetése az üzleti életbe, majd később a PC / internet az üzleti életbe. Nos, nem voltam ott, amikor az előbbi történt, és nem voltam az iparágban, amikor a személyi számítógépek forradalma az üzletbe söpört, de lefogadom, hogy ez az eddigi legközelebbi összehasonlítás. Ezek átkozottul újak, és nagy változások azon túl, hogy csak Mac-eket vagy új szoftvereket vagy új üzleti folyamatokat hoznak. |
