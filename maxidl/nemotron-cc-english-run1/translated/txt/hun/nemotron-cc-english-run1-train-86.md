| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>A történelmi Leclaire környéket, amelyet egykor Edwardsville "déli külvárosaként" emlegettek, szövetkezeti közösségként alapították 1890-ben, és külön falu maradt, amíg 1934-ben Edwardsville városához nem csatolták. Újságok és magazinok szerte az Egyesült Államokban és Európában beszámoltak a Leclaire-kísérletről, különösen fennállásának első 20 évében. 1979-ben egyedülálló története miatt az egykori község szerepel a Történelmi Helyek Országos Jegyzékében.<br/><br/>A Leclaire-t Nelson Oliver Nelson, egy St. Louis-i vízvezeték-gyártó alapította, aki sok éven át igyekezett előmozdítani a munkásosztály helyzetét. Nelson javítani kívánta alkalmazottai munkakörülményeit, és a gyárak közelében lakásokat akart biztosítani, hogy a munkások és családjaik könnyen részt vehessenek a cég által ingyenesen kínált rekreációs és oktatási programokban. 1890 előtt, még St. Louis-ban, a N. O. Nelson Company gyártási és forgalmazási vállalkozásai elkezdték a nyereség megosztását, valamint az oktatási és rekreációs lehetőségeket. A Leclaire-féle kooperatív kísérlet további előnyökkel járna.<br/><br/>Amikor a Nelson alkalmazottai jelezték, hogy vidéki helyre akarnak költözni, a vállalat képviselői több Missouri és Illinois közösség kis városainak vezetőit is megkeresték St. Louis-i központjuk közelében. Megfelelő ingatlant kerestek új gyárak és egy mintafalu építésére. Edwardsville-től délre találtak egy 125 hektáros földterületet, amely vízhez, szénhez és szállításhoz való hozzáféréssel rendelkezik. A helyi üzletemberek gyorsan cselekedtek, hogy pénzügyi ösztönzést nyújtsanak. Kevesebb, mint három hét alatt a közösség 20 000 dolláros alapot gyűjtött össze 1 és 1000 dollár közötti egyéni hozzájárulásokból, hogy rávegyék Nelsont, hogy Edwardsville-t válassza vállalkozásához.<br/><br/>A város vezetői azt remélték, hogy Edwardsville városhatárain belül találnak ingatlant, de amikor nem találtak megfelelő helyszínt, biztosak voltak abban, hogy a várostól délre fekvő Nelson-beruházás hamarosan Edwardsville részévé válik. Bár Nelson teljesítette az építkezés és a munkahelyteremtés minden feltételét a szerződésében, 44 évvel az Edwardsville annektálása előtt. Leclaire, melyet a Madison/Brown Avenues határolt keletre, a vasúti sínek nyugatra, a Hadley/McKinley Avenues délre és a Wolf Street északra, 1890 és 1934 között önálló község maradt. Ez idő alatt hírnevet szerzett az üzleti életben, az oktatásban és a lakóépületek tervezésében.<br/><br/>Leclaire falu Edwardsville 1931-es térképén<br/>Paul Jenkins szíves engedélyével<br/><br/>Nelson döntése, hogy falut épít, nem szeszélyből történt. Az 1880-as évek végére nemzetközi vezető volt az együttműködés és a nyereségmegosztás területén, társadalmi elméleteket cserélt másokkal a világ minden tájáról, miközben bővítette St. Louis üzletét. Kísérleti faluját a párizsi haszonélvezőről, Edme Jean Leclaire-ről nevezte el, de sok más társadalmi látnokot is meglátogatott, akik információkat és inspirációt nyújtottak. Ezekből a példákból összeállította a legjobb ötleteket, Nelson megalapította Leclaire-t, hogy szavaival élve "dolgozzon, támogassa az intelligenciát, biztosítsa a kikapcsolódást, ápolja a szépséget és otthonokat teremtsen." Ezek mind olyan tényezők voltak, amelyeket szükségesnek tartott ahhoz, hogy a férfiak teljes életet éljenek. A későbbi írók ezeket a szavakat használták Leclaire alapító elveinek megfogalmazására: Munka, Otthonok, Oktatás, Szabadidő és Szépség, de a Szabadság további fontos elvével.<br/><br/>Munka<br/><br/>E tényezők közül a munkát lehetne a legfontosabbnak tekinteni, mivel a leclaire-i gyári munkahelyek nélkül nem lenne falu. A téglagyár épületeit E. A. Cameron építész tervezte, hogy természetes fényt, szellőzést biztosítsanak nyáron, és télen fűtött padlót biztosítsanak. Tűzelfojtó rendszer volt, és bár az ipari baleseteket nem szüntették meg, minden erőfeszítést megtettek a munkavállalók biztonságának garantálására. A borostyánnal borított téglaépületeket jól gondozott pázsitok és virágoskertek vették körül, amelyek campusszerű megjelenést kölcsönöztek a komplexumnak. 1894-ben a New York World riportere, Nellie Bly az épületeket "az épületek ideális tökéletességének nevezte, hogy az ember dolgozzon benne".<br/><br/>A leclaire-i N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company gyártási komplexuma<br/>Leclaire barátai<br/><br/>A Nelson vállalati politikáit úgy tervezték, hogy megvédjék a munkavállalók pénzügyi stabilitását. A munkavállalók a nyereség egy részét kereshetik, és hangot adhatnak a vállalatnak, ha ezt a lehetőséget választják. A nyereségmegosztási terv a Nelson alkalmazottainak büszkeségét adta, ami támogató munkaerőt eredményezett. Az évek során néhány rövid élettartamú munkaerő sztrájk volt, de a legtöbb esetben a munkaerő-problémák ritkák voltak. A munkásoknak ésszerű munkaidejük és versenyképes fizetésük is volt. Volt egy gondviselői alap, amely biztosította a nyugdíjakat és a betegszabadságot, valamint az özvegyi nyugdíjakat, ha egy munkavállaló meghalt, függetlenül attól, hogy a halál összefügg-e a foglalkoztatásával.<br/><br/>A N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) székhelye St. Louisban maradt, de az összes N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company-t Leclaire-be költöztették. A gyártó céget üzletekre osztották, amelyek különböző termékeket készítettek. 1900-ban az üzletek adózási szempontból önálló vállalatokká váltak, de mindegyik még mindig a N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company tulajdonában volt. Az üzletek közé tartozott a Szekrénymalom, ahol a szekrényektől a malomig fatermékeket állítottak elő. Az itt dolgozó szakképzett kézművesek speciális szerződéseket is teljesítettek, köztük egy helyi bank pénztárosi ketrecét és egy oltárt, amely még mindig használatban van az Edwardsville-i Szent András episzkopális templomban. A Marble Shop építészeti márványra specializálódott, amelyet Nelson legénysége vágott és telepített otthonokban, vállalkozásokban, sőt az állami fővárosokban is. A Bignall és Keeler néven működő Gépműhely csőillesztő gépeket, szivattyúkat, mérőműszereket és különböző mechanikus eszközöket készített a vízvezeték-kereskedelemben. Az 1890-es évek közepén olyan speciális termékek gyártására is szétágaztak, mint a Leclaire Bicycle. A Brass Shophoz tartozott egy öntöde, ahol különböző vízvezeték csöveket és szerszámokat gyártottak. Ezek a példák csak néhányat jelentenek a Leclaire gyárakban végzett munkákból. A cég logója egy stilizált "NONCO" volt, amely még ma is látható a vízvezeték-berendezéseken és néhány tűzcsapon Edwardsville-ben.<br/><br/>Otthonok<br/><br/>Mielőtt az otthonokat megépíthették volna, lakásra volt szükség azoknak a munkásoknak, akik befejezték a gyár épületeit, valamint házakat építettek. Ezen igények kielégítésére a vállalat megépítette a "Club House" -t, egy nagy épületet, amely számos célt szolgált. A szállás mellett ez volt a közösség első oktatási épülete, és egy jól felszerelt könyvtárat is tartalmazott.<br/><br/>Leclaire lakónegyedének építése közvetlenül a falu 1890. júniusi alapítása után kezdődött. Julius Pitzman, az innovatív tájépítész, aki az első tételeket Leclaire-ben fektette le, számos védelmi szövetséget hozott létre. A szövetségek széles, kanyargós utcákról, nagy telkekről rendelkeztek, és olyan okirati korlátozásról, amely az ingatlanokat csak lakó- vagy oktatási célokra korlátozta. A cég kikövezte az utcákat, elektromos utcai lámpákat biztosított, járdákat telepített, és több száz fát ültetett Leclaire utcái mentén. A Leclaire későbbi szakaszait hagyományos rácskialakítással és kisebb tételekkel fektették le, de még mindig tartalmazták a okirati korlátozásokat.<br/><br/>Leclaire viktoriánus ház 1907-ben<br/>Cindy Reinhardttól<br/><br/>Kezdetben a házakat a vállalat építette, majd közel költséggel értékesítették a Nelson alkalmazottainak, hogy ösztönözzék a lakástulajdonlást. Ha egy munkavállaló megbetegedett, és nem tudta jelzálogot fizetni, a kifizetéseket felfüggesztették, amíg vissza nem tért a munkába. Az otthonokat különböző háztervekben kínálták, és a cég azt hirdette, hogy nincs két egyforma lakás. A legkorábbi otthonok elsősorban viktoriánus házak voltak, amelyek árammal és folyóvízzel érkeztek. Ezeket követték a bungalók, a négynégyzetek, sőt néhány kit otthon is. A lakosok vásárolhattak egy céges házat, vagy vásárolhattak egy üres telket, és maguk is építhettek házat, feltéve, hogy az építészeti tervezés megfelel a vállalati szabványoknak.<br/><br/>A későbbi években sokat eladtak a befektetőknek, általában Edwardsville-i lakosoknak, és az 1920-as években sok otthont építettek a helyi vállalkozók, akik ezután eladták őket a helyi lakosoknak.<br/><br/>Oktatás<br/><br/>Nelson hitt az oktatásban mindenki számára, beleértve a munkásosztályt is. Az oktatási programozás 1892-ben kezdődött egy óvodával a Club House-ban, és folytatódott az új oktatási épületben a 722 Holyoake Road-on. Általánosan "Iskolaháznak" nevezik, ez az épület egy nagy termet biztosított a találkozóknak és programoknak, de mozgatható partíciókkal rendelkezett, hogy a nap folyamán osztályteremre osszon. Esténként táncok, találkozók vagy programok voltak a Leclaire Önkultúra Klubban, ahol a Washington Egyetem professzorai vagy országosan ismert előadók heti előadásai voltak, akik, mint N. O. Nelson, a századforduló társadalomjobbító mozgalmának részét képezték. Ezek közé tartozott többek között Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones és Charlotte Perkins Gilman író.<br/><br/>1913-ban beiratkozott gyerekek a Leclaire óvodába<br/>Cindy Reinhardttól<br/><br/>Az 1895-ös oktatási épület építését követő tíz évben egy sor oktatási kísérlet történt, köztük egy ipari iskola, főiskola, éjszakai iskola és egy akadémia. A legkorábbi és leghosszabb életű vállalkozás az 1892-ben alapított reggeli óvoda volt, amely a Fröbel-modellt használta. Ez a kétéves program mindenki számára ingyenes volt, beleértve az Edwardsville-i gyermekeket is, egészen 1931-ig, amikor pénzügyi okokból a vállalat tandíjat kezdett felszámítani olyan diákoknak, akik nem az alkalmazottak gyermekei voltak. A Nelson Manufacturing 1934-ig óvodát működtetett, amikor az épületet névleges díj ellenében átadták az Edwardsville-i Iskolakerületnek.<br/><br/>Szabadidő<br/><br/>Hajósok a Leclaire-tavon 1915-ben<br/>Cindy Reinhardttól<br/><br/>A pihenés fontos jellemzője volt a Leclaire-nek. A cég sportlétesítményeket biztosított a baseball, a tenisz és később a labdarúgás számára. Egy bowling- és biliárdcsarnokot építettek, és télen volt egy tó csónakázásra, úszásra, halászatra vagy korcsolyázásra. A Leclaire Parkot csónakházakkal, férfi és női fürdőházakkal és egy nagy pavilonnal látták el. A lakosok táncokat, hairidákat, betűző méheket és más tevékenységeket szerveztek, és a társaság szponzorált egy zenekart, amely rendszeresen játszott a faluban vagy Edwardsville-ben. A Club House and School House oktatási funkcióihoz hasonlóan a Leclaire szabadidős létesítményei mindenki számára nyitva álltak, és gyakran voltak Edwardsville, sőt St. Louis látogatóinak célpontjai.<br/><br/>Szépség<br/><br/>Fényképek Leclaire Lake<br/>Cindy Reinhardttól<br/><br/>Az utolsó tényező, amelyet Nelson fontosnak tartott a kielégítő élethez, a környezetet érintette. Nelson tudott az egészséges élet fontosságáról. Értékelte az országban fellelhető szépséget és tisztaságot, és arra ösztönözte Leclaire-ben mindenkit, hogy kerteket és gyümölcsösöket telepítsenek. Nelson maga is példát mutatott, így egy cég üvegháza ingyenes virágokat és versenyeket biztosított a legszebb udvarokra. Leclaire-t úgy alakították ki, hogy az egész falu parkszerű környezete még ma is nyilvánvaló legyen.<br/><br/>Szabadság<br/><br/>A Leclaire Szövetkezeti áruház<br/>Cindy Reinhardttól<br/><br/>Nelson öt alapelvet sorolt fel Leclaire számára, de a modern írók hozzáadnak egy hatodikat: Freedom. A vállalat által kínált összes program elérhető volt az alkalmazottak és a helyi lakosok számára, de egyik sem volt kötelező. A választás szabadsága, hogy részt vegyen-e a vállalati programokban, teljes mértékben az egyéntől függött. A Leclaire lakói dolgozhattak a Nelson Manufacturing-nek vagy máshol, és a munkavállalók nem voltak kötelesek Leclaire-ben élni. A rekreációs és oktatási programokban való részvétel is opcionális volt. Volt egy céges bolt is, ahol a munkavállalók vásárolhattak, de a többi céges várossal ellentétben senki sem tartozott a céges boltnak. A Leclaire Store egy szövetkezet volt, ahol a tagok tisztességes piaci árakat számítottak fel, de negyedéves osztalékot fizettek.<br/><br/>Egy másik város<br/><br/>Mindezek az előnyök a Leclaire-t egyedülállóvá tették más vállalati városokból. De voltak olyan egyedi esetek is, amikor a vállalat együttérzést és gondoskodást mutatott az alkalmazottak számára. A cég bezárta a gyárakat és kirándulóvonatokat bérelt, hogy az 1904-es St. Louis-i világkiállításon egy napra elvigyék a munkásokat és családjaikat St. Louisba. Amikor a pénz szűkös volt, Nelson alkalmanként plusz pénzt helyezett el minden egyes fizetési borítékban, hogy megkönnyítse a munkások életét, és ha olyan programot indított, amellyel az emberek nem értettek egyet, megbeszélték, és amilyen gyakran nem, Nelson megfordította magát.<br/><br/>A norvégiai Lillesandban született 1841-ben, N. O. Nelson bonyolult ember volt. Kapitalista volt, aki hitt a szabad vállalkozásban, de szocialista is, az "aranyszabály" követője, és hazafi, aki az Unióért szolgált a polgárháborúban. 1900-ra már multimilliomos volt, de 1922-ben bekövetkezett halála idejére már mindent odaadott a munkásosztály jobbításáért.<br/><br/>Bár nem Leclaire volt Nelson egyetlen társadalmi kísérlete, mégis a legsikeresebb törekvésének tartják. A társadalom javítására irányuló további jelentős erőfeszítések közé tartozott a New Orleans-i szövetkezeti élelmiszerboltok láncolata, az alabamai Bessemerben lévő fekete alkalmazottak gyermekeinek óvodája, gyárai és a fogyasztók otthona Indióban, Kaliforniában.<br/><br/>A Nelson's Village of Leclaire nemzetközi hírű, figyelemre méltó és sikeres kísérlet volt. A New York World számos alkalommal írta le, de különösen Nellie Bly riporter 1894-ben, aki hosszasan írt a modellvárosról, ahol "A munkaügyi kérdés megoldódott, és mindenki boldog egy kis faluban St. Louis közelében." A Los Angeles Times is rendszeresen tudósított N. O.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | A szerző látogatásai nagyítással vagy Skype-on keresztül<br/><br/>Izgatott vagyok, hogy látogassa meg a diákok keresztül Zoom vagy Skype! Skype egy nagyszerű lehetőség az iskolák / osztályok, akik nem hozza be a személyes szerzők, de akik szeretnék felfedezni a könyveket és a költészetet, kapcsolatba lépni a szerző, és tegyen fel egy-egy kérdést.<br/><br/>Költség<br/><br/>Kínálok 30-45 perces nagyítást vagy Skype-látogatásokat az iskolákkal 125 dollárért munkamenetenként (vagy 200 dollár két munkamenetre, három órán belül reggel vagy délután; 325 dollár három munkamenetre egy nap alatt; 425 dollár négy munkamenetre egy nap alatt). Minden foglalkozáson igyekszem a lehető legaktívabban bevonni a gyerekeket. Nem, ez nem ugyanaz a fajta kapcsolat, mint a személyes látogatási ajánlatok, de még mindig inspiráló és motiváló lehet a gyerekek számára!<br/><br/>Amit én csinálok<br/><br/>Minden munkamenet legfeljebb 50 diák tartalmaz:<br/><br/>5 perces tech set-up<br/><br/>3 darab, egyenként 10 perces szegmens – Ön a következők közül választhat:<br/><br/>Hogyan lettem író<br/><br/>A könyv megírása (kiválasztja, hogy melyik könyvre összpontosítok)<br/><br/>Olvasás (Olvastam néhány verset, és a gyerekek segítenek nekem olvasni másokat)<br/><br/>Osztálytermi bemutató (a diákok olvasást vagy előadást adnak nekem - nagyon hálás közönség!)<br/><br/>Együtt írni egy verset<br/><br/>Kérdések és válaszok ülése<br/><br/>5 perc búcsúzás / Goodbye<br/><br/>Beszélgetek a szolgálat előtti tanárok osztályaival vagy a szolgálatban lévő tanárok csoportjaival a költészetről és az írásról.<br/><br/>Tippek a nagy virtuális látogatáshoz<br/><br/>Tippek a sikeres virtuális látogatáshoz<br/><br/>Az egyik célom a virtuális iskolai látogatásokkal az, hogy megragadjam az interaktivitást, ami a személyes látogatásokat sikeressé és szórakoztatóvá teszi. De az igazság az, hogy néha nehéz virtuálisan interaktívnak lenni! Lehet, hogy az időzítés nem megfelelően szinkronizálódik, ami kihívást jelent az együtt olvasásra, és nagyon nehéz meghallgatni az egyes diákokat, hacsak nem jönnek fel, és beszélnek közvetlenül a mikrofonba / számítógépbe. De néhány próba és hiba után felfedeztem néhány módot a lehető legjobb virtuális látogatásokra. Itt vannak: 10 módja annak, hogy a diákokkal való látogatásom nagyszerű élmény legyen!<br/><br/>A látogatás előtt<br/><br/>Hogy a gyerekek a lehető legnagyobb izgalommal a látogatás. Látogasson el a honlapom velük. Olvassa el néhány könyvem velük. Gyűjts össze néhány kérdést a diákok számomra. Bármi, amit az idő előtt, hogy úgy érzi, mint egy nagy üzlet fog menni egy hosszú út felé hallgatói elkötelezettség.<br/><br/>Helyezze el a videokamerát vagy a laptopot webkamerával, hogy a lehető legtöbbet láthassam a közönségből. Nehéz felmérni a hallgatói elkötelezettséget, ha csak néhány diákot látok.<br/><br/>Korlátozza az egyes csoportok 50 diák. Ez hihetetlenül nehéz, hogy vegyenek részt a nagy csoportok videón keresztül.<br/><br/>Gyorsan haladok a témáról a témára vagy a versről a versre. Kérjük, emlékeztesse a tanulókat, hogy alaposan meg kell hallgatniuk, hogy megértsék, mi történik.<br/><br/>Alkalmanként, én egy kis Reader's Theater a diákok. Ha küldök bármilyen szkriptelt diák részek idő előtt, nyomtassa ki egy példányt minden ülésen, és darabokra vágva, ha szükséges.<br/><br/>A látogatás során<br/><br/>Amikor egy könyvről beszélek, ha nálad van az a nyomtatott könyv, kérlek, tartsd fel, hogy a diákok láthassák.<br/><br/>Te vagy a megbízottam. Gyakran nem hívhatom fel a diákokat, és nem hallhatom az egyéni válaszokat. Tehát azt mondhatom: "3 ötletet fogunk kapni. Emelje fel a kezét, ha van ötlete." Aztán átveszed az irányítást, felhívsz három diákot, és bejelented a válaszokat mindenkinek, aki a teremben van, és nekem is.<br/><br/>Válasszon magabiztos, kimenő diákokat a scriptelt hallgatói részekhez (ha előre küldök). Személyes iskolai látogatásaim során megpróbálom felhívni a kevésbé magabiztos diákokat, de azt tapasztaltam, hogy ez nem működik olyan jól a virtuális látogatások során, mert nem hallom őket.<br/><br/>A beszélő részekkel rendelkező diákok üljenek előre, amikor itt az ideje, álljanak fel, és emlékeztessék őket, hogy hangosan beszéljenek.<br/><br/>A virtuális látogatások során a viselkedéskezelés kizárólag Önre esik. Gyakran nem látom pontosan, hogy mi történik, ezért kérjük, lépjen be, ha szükséges. Ha van egy nagy zavar, csak kérd meg, hogy tartsa egy pillanatra, hogy én nem fecsegni, miközben senki sem figyel:>)<br/><br/>Nyugodtan készíts rólam képeket a képernyőn, és oszd meg a közösségi médiában – még akkor is, ha a rólam készült képek gyakran nevetségesnek tűnnek, mert vicces arcokat vagy valamit csinálok olvasás közben!<br/><br/>Ha bármilyen kérdése van, kérjük, csak kérdezze meg, akár a látogatás előtt, akár alatt!<br/><br/>Virtuális munkamenet ütemezése<br/><br/>Szeretne egy virtuális látogatást ütemezni velem?

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors.

The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | A kísértetcsapdák hatásának vizsgálata a kék rákra, a Callinectis Sapidusra a Barnegat-öbölben<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods2008. szeptember 16.<br/><br/>Úgy döntöttem, hogy a kék rákot, a Callinectus sapidust használom a kísérletemhez, mert bőséges itt a Barnegat-öbölben, és viszonylag könnyű elkapni.<br/><br/>A Callinectes sapidus egy úszó rák, amely fontos a kereskedelmi puhahéjú rákászok számára, mind kereskedelmi, mind szabadidős (Jivoff 2008)<br/><br/>Szellemcsapdák akkor fordulnak elő, amikor egy csapda elveszett, de továbbra is elkapja az organizmusokat (Breen 1990) John Wnek azt mondja, hogy könnyen van 2000 Barnegat BayMivel a C. sapidus annyira agresszív (Pollock 1998) , mi történik, ha ketrecben ragadnak élelem nélkül, és milyen hatása van ennek?<br/><br/>Ha egy szellemcsapdába kerül, a C. sapidusnak kannibál hajlamai lesznek, amíg az utolsó ki nem hal az éhezés miatt.<br/><br/>Hogyan duplikálunk egy szellemcsapdát a laborban?Létrehozni a szellemcsapdát a bejáratok dróthálóval és cipzárral történő lezárásával Miután a minta betöltődött, zárja le a tetejét cipzárral<br/><br/>A rák bejárata dróthálóval lezárva<br/><br/>Rák TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>Hogyan kap rákok?Trap néhány nappal korábban, és éheztetni őketHa egyszer készen áll, gyűjtsük össze az új rákok csapdákAdd közvetlenül a szellem csapda 2 éhezett tank<br/><br/>Hat rák összesen, egy hiányziktalált egy kis helyet a meneküléshez; zip tie-vel foltozvaKét rák halottAz egyiknek csak karmai vannak.Más hiányzik mind a lapát, mind az egyik karom<br/><br/>Négy élő és ép rákA nagyobb döglött ráknak nincs aprópénzeA kisebb döglött ráknak csak egy része maradt meg.<br/><br/>A kísérlet utolsó napjaKét minta eltárolásaNincs változás az első minta második napjához képestMásodik megfigyelés, a nagyobb karamell elválasztva a test többi részétől/karmától<br/><br/>Az eredmények alapján elutasítom a nullhipotézisemet, hogy a rákok egyszerűen a csapdába kerülnek.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | A nap szava: Opció<br/><br/>Opció: Olyan megállapodás, amely egy meghatározott ideig nyitva tartja az ingatlan eladására vagy bérbeadására vonatkozó ajánlatot. Egy lehetőség lehet használni, például, hogy a vevő időt, hogy megoldja a kérdéseket a finanszírozás, a cím, rendezési és megvalósíthatósági elkötelezettség előtt a vevő vásárolni. Opciók gyakran használják a föld összeszerelési folyamat. Az opciót a tényleges ellenértéknek kell támogatnia, amely független és független az ingatlan vételárától. Önmagában az ellenszolgáltatásra vonatkozó preambulumbekezdés nem elegendő, kivéve a lízingbe adást, amelyben a lízing rendelkezései önmagukban elegendő ellenszolgáltatást jelentenek az opció támogatásához. Az opció pusztán szerződéses jogot hoz létre; nem ad az opciósnak semmilyen ingatlant az ingatlanban. Az opció aláírásának időpontjában a tulajdonos nem adja el, és a vevő nem vásárolja meg az ingatlant. Bár a tulajdonos köteles eladni, ha a vevő értesítést küld, a vevő nem köteles vásárolni.

These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | A karotinoidok előnyei a bőr számára<br/><br/>Hallottál már a karotinoidokról? Ezek az erős fitokemikáliák a növényekben található pigmentált összetevők, amelyek virágokat, gyümölcsöket adnak, és sárga, narancssárga és piros színt hagynak.<br/><br/>Az 1930-as évek óta a tudósok körülbelül 800 karotinoidot azonosítottak, és körülbelül 40-et találtak az emberi testben, beleértve az epidermisz legkülső rétegét, a bőrt és a bőr alatti zsírt. A leggyakoribb karotinoidok a béta-karotin, az alfa-karotin, a lutein, a zeaxantin, a likopin és az asztaxantin. Az asztaxantinról itt olvashat többet.<br/><br/>A bőr karotinoid tartalmát számos tényező befolyásolja, beleértve a gyümölcsök és zöldségek bevitelét, a különböző élelmiszerekből való biológiai hozzáférhetőségüket, a kiegészítést, az UV sugárzásnak való kitettséget, a légszennyezést, az alkoholfogyasztást, a dohányzást és a stresszt.<br/><br/>Hogyan segítenek a karotinoidok a bőrömnek?<br/><br/>A karotinoidok a legismertebb antioxidánsok a bőr számára, és gyulladáscsökkentőként is fontos szerepet töltenek be.<br/><br/>Egészséges öregedés és bőrjavítás<br/><br/>Az antioxidánsok nélkülözhetetlenek az egészséges bőr számára, mert segítenek megakadályozni a sejtek szabad gyökök károsodását. A szabad gyökök károsodása korai öregedést és különböző típusú bőrrákok kialakulását okozza. A karotinoidok, valamint az E-vitamin, a C-vitamin és a Q10 Co enzim fontos dermális antioxidánsok.<br/><br/>Antioxidáns hatásuknak köszönhetően a karotinoidok támogatják és ösztönzik a kollagén és elasztin termelést a bőrben. Ez segít növelni a bőr sűrűségét, vastagságát, rugalmasságát és feszességét. Kollagén és elasztin csökken, ahogy öregszünk, így egyre elég karotinoidok a diéta és helyileg kritikus az öregedés is.<br/><br/>A karotinoidok javíthatják a fotoaging jeleit, a bőr elszíneződését, rugalmasságát, hidratálását, textúráját, és csökkenthetik a transzepidermális vízveszteséget.<br/><br/>Az asztaxantin különösen serkenti a fibroblasztokat kollagén és elasztin termelésére, gátolja a kollagént és elasztint lebontó enzimek aktivitását, gyulladáscsökkentő és UV-szűrő hatást mutat. Kimutatták, hogy csökkenti a melanint a bőrben, ami a szeplők és a melasma megjelenésének csökkenését eredményezi.<br/><br/>Anti-akne aktivitás: a karotinoidok gyulladáscsökkentő hatása segít a pattanások gyulladásának és irritációjának csökkentésében. A karotinoidok segítenek a faggyúmirigyek olajváladékának normalizálásában és kiegyensúlyozásában is. Értékes hatóanyagok a bőr javításában, és stimulálják az epidermális regenerálódást, segítve a bőr simítását és lágyítását.<br/><br/>Hol találok karotinoidokat?<br/><br/>A karotinoidok napi adagjának két módja van: az étrenden és a helyi alkalmazáson keresztül. A kettő kombinációja az ideális megközelítés a jól öregedő bőrápoláshoz.<br/><br/>A karotinoidok zsírban oldódnak, így a szervezetnek zsírra van szüksége ahhoz, hogy felszívja őket (gondoljunk a paradicsomra és az olívaolajra, a brokkolira és a vajra, vagy a spenótra és az avokádóra). A karotinoidok gyakori forrásai az élelmiszerekben az avokádó, a tojássárgája, a kelkáposzta, a spenót, a sárgarépa, az édesburgonya, a papaya és a paradicsom.<br/><br/>Miközben azt javasoljuk, hogy minél több tápanyagot és antioxidánst kapjon az élelmiszerből, nem pedig kiegészítést; egy tanulmány kimutatta, hogy az asztaxantin és a kollagén hidrolizátum jelentősen javította a gát integritását, csökkentette a transzepidermális vízveszteséget és növelte a prokollagén I típusú mRNS expresszióját.<br/><br/>A helyi alkalmazás kulcsfontosságú az egészséges bőr számára. A tanulmányok azt mutatják, hogy az emberi bőrben lévő antioxidánsok magas koncentrációja a legjobb védelmet nyújtja az egészséges bőrnek minden korban.<br/><br/>A Sarka Botanicals-nál karotinoidban gazdag, egész növényeket, például a körömvirágot, a pitypangot és az asztaxantinhoz hasonló kivonatokat hidegen sajtolt olajokkal és funkcionális összetevőkkel keverjük. A kalendula önmagában több mint 19 különböző típusú karotinoidot tartalmaz. Ez megmagyarázhatja, hogy miért olyan régóta használják a bőrápolásban. Tanulmányok azt mutatják, hogy a Q10 koenzimrel kevert karotinoidok különösen hatékonyak a gyulladás csökkentésében és a korai bőröregedés lassításában a napsugárzás miatt. |
