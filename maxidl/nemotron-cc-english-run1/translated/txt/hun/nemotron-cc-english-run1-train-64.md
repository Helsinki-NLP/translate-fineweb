| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - A Biblián keresztül C2000 SeriesShall Térjünk rá a Cselekedetek könyvének első fejezetére, amikor elkezdjük tanulmányozni a korai egyházat.<br/>Lukács, az Apostolok cselekedetei könyvének szerzője, Pál apostol társa, aki Lukács szerint az evangélium szerzője is volt, ezt a két értekezést írta egy barátjának, Theophilusnak. A Theophilus görög név. Ez egy név, amelynek gyönyörű jelentése van. A név Isten szeretőjét jelenti. Vannak, akik úgy vélik, hogy egyáltalán nem ember volt, hanem az evangélium és az Apostolok cselekedeteinek könyve Isten szerelmeseinek szól, bárki is legyen. Vannak más hagyományok is, amelyek szerint Theophilus valójában Lukács ura volt, hogy akkoriban az orvosok rabszolgák voltak, általában egy gazdag patrónus rabszolgája. Így hát Lukács mestere Theophilus volt, és elengedte Lukácsot, hogy Pállal legyen a missziós utakon. Ez az egyház korai hagyománya, de természetesen lehetetlen bizonyítani, mint oly sok hagyomány.<br/>Vannak olyanok is, akik azt hiszik, hogy amikor Pál Tróászban volt, és látomást kapott egy embertől, aki azt mondta neki: "Gyere át Macedóniába és segíts nekünk", hogy ez az ember Pál látomásában nem volt más, mint Lukács. Az első, akivel Pál valóban találkozott, amikor Makedóniába jött, Lukács volt. És mivel az Apostolok cselekedeteinek könyvében vagyunk, azt találjuk, hogy amikor eljutunk az Apostolok cselekedetei könyvének azon részéhez, Lukács többet kezd írni az első személyben, mint a harmadik személyben. Tehát nyilvánvalóan az Apostolok cselekedeteinek ezen a pontján Lukács Pál társává vált, és elkezdett vele utazni. A "mi" és a "mi" névmásokat kezdte használni az "ők" és az "ők" helyett. Kétségkívül ez az a hely, ahol Luke résztvevővé és szemtanúvá vált azoknak a dolgoknak, amik innentől kezdve történtek.<br/>Az Apostolok cselekedeteit azzal kezdi, hogy összekapcsolja az Evangéliummal Lukács szerint. Érdekes, hogy az utolsó dolog, amit Lukács feljegyez az evangéliumában, az első dolog, amit feljegyez az Apostolok cselekedeteiben. Lukács evangéliuma bezárul, amikor Jézus azt mondja tanítványainak, hogy várjanak Jeruzsálemben, amíg meg nem ruházzák őket hatalommal a magasból. Aztán Jézus felment a mennybe, és így bezárja az evangéliumot. Az Apostolok cselekedeteinek megnyitásakor írja:<br/>Az előbbi értekezést (azaz a Lukács szerinti evangéliumot) írtam neked, ó, Theophilus, mindarról, amit Jézus elkezdett tenni és tanítani (ApCsel 1:1).<br/>A kulcsszó megkezdődött. Az evangélium Lukács szerint nem Jézus Krisztus szolgálatának teljes története. Ez csak Jézus Krisztus szolgálatának kezdete. Jézus továbbra is szolgálja az emberek szükségleteit. Jézus továbbra is gyógyítja a betegeket. Jézus továbbra is a halottakat támasztja fel. Jézus továbbra is szolgálja szeretetét és evangéliumát a világnak, csak most Ő szolgál azokon a tanítványokon keresztül, akik felkenettek az Ő Szent Lelkével. De Krisztus szolgálata folytatódik; alapvetően az a premissza, amelyet Lukács az Apostolok cselekedeteiben vesz fel. Mindannak a korábbi értekezése, amit Jézus elkezdett, mind a cselekvés, mind a tanítás.<br/>Ezért az Apostolok Cselekedetei befejezetlen könyv: az Úr ma is munkálkodik azok életén keresztül, akik Istennek szentelték magukat. Ahhoz, hogy Szentlelke vezessen, vezessen és felkenjen, hogy Jézus szolgálatát a mai világban folytassa. Most Isten elrendelte, hogy munkáját emberi eszközökkel kell elvégezni. Nem mondom, hogy ezt be kell fejezni. Isten angyali lényeket használhat fel a munkájához, és el fog jönni az idő a Jelenések könyve alatt, amikor Isten angyalokat fog használni, hogy hirdessék az Ő evangéliumát az embereknek az egész világon. Jelenések könyve, 14. fejezet, "Az első angyal, aki az ég közepén repül, és örök evangéliuma van" (Jel 14:6). De jelenleg Isten úgy döntött, hogy emberi eszközöket használ. Bármilyen tökéletlenek is legyenek, Isten mégis ezt rendelte el. Az izgalmas dolog az, hogy Isten használni fog engem, és Isten használni fog téged. Sokszor könyörgünk: "Uram, nem tudok beszélni. Soha nem tudtam beszélni, sem most, Uram." Ahogy Mózes megpróbálta könyörögni Isten hívását. Jeremiás azt mondta: "Uram, én csak egy gyerek vagyok, senki sem fog rám hallgatni." És mindannyiunknak megvan a kifogása, hogy miért nem lehet minket használni. Nem igaz? Mindannyian tudjuk az okokat, amiért Isten nem tudott használni minket.<br/>Egyszer, amikor az Úr prófétát hívott, hogy tegye a dolgát, azt mondta: "Uram, küldj, akit akarsz." Az Úr azt mondta: "Hé, hívtalak." "Uram, jó ötlet; küld, akit akarsz." Oly gyakran vagyunk abban a helyzetben, hogy "Uram, küldd el annak a kezét, akinek akarod, bárkinek, kivéve nekem, Uram." És mégis, Isten elrendelte, hogy használjon minket.<br/>Most mindannyian megmutathatjuk saját tökéletlenségeinket. Mindannyian rámutathatunk saját fogyatékosságainkra, és mindannyian találhatunk kifogást arra, hogy Isten miért nem akar használni engem. De Isten mégis úgy döntött, hogy téged használ. Hogy az életeden keresztül felfedje magát egy rászoruló világnak. Kíváncsi vagy, mikor Isten ilyen eszközöket használ arra, hogy valaha is elvégezze a munkát, ugye?<br/>Mindaddig a napig, amelyen felvitetett, azután a Szentlélek által parancsolatokat adott az apostoloknak, akiket kiválasztott (ApCsel 1:2).<br/>Ezzel fejezte be Lukács evangéliumát. Azon a napon, amikor Jézus felvétetett, miután azt mondta az apostoloknak, hogy várják meg a hatalom adományát.<br/>Akinek [az apostoloknak] is megmutatta magát elevenen, szenvedése [vagy halála] után, sok csalhatatlan bizonyítékkal (ApCsel 1:3).<br/>Nehéz tagadni Jézus Krisztus feltámadásának tényét. Szórakozott voltam, valamint bosszantottam és bosszantottam egy cikket, amelyet a Santa Ana Register-ben olvastam a múlt szombaton. A megyei iskolákban bemutatott teremtéstudományról és evolúciós elméletekről. Hogyan, ez a professzor azt mondta, hogy tudományos osztályt tanít, és így csak a tényekkel foglalkoznak, és hogy nincs helyük az elméleteknek. Mivel a tudomány tényeken alapul, és a teremtés vallási babonákon alapul. Sok hitre van szükség ahhoz, hogy higgyünk a vallási elméletekben. Amikor tényekkel foglalkozol, egyszerűen elfogadhatod őket. Azt gondoltam: "Nagyon érdekes volt, hogy a természettudományos órákon megtanították nekem, hogy a világ négymilliárd éves. Ma azt tanítják, hogy a világ tizenkét milliárd éves. És nem is olyan régen jártam iskolába.”<br/>Érdekes, hogy a Bibliát soha nem kellett felülvizsgálni vagy frissíteni, hogy megfeleljen az aktuális adatoknak, amelyeket az emberek felfedeztek. És mégis, ha ma elvennék a középiskolai tankönyveimet, és megpróbálnának tanítani tőlük egy természettudományos osztályt, azt találnák, hogy sok olyan dolgot, amit a középiskolában tudományos tényként tanítottak, már nem ismernek el tudományos tényként. Az egyszerű sejt protoplazma már nem egyszerű sejt, hanem rendkívül összetett. Ha van olyan tény, amely a történelemben igazolható, az Jézus Krisztus feltámadásának ténye a halálból.<br/>Van egy joggyakorlati rendszerünk, amely a tanúk vallomásán alapul. Ha valakit bűncselekménnyel vádolnak, és vannak olyan emberek, akik szemtanúi voltak ennek a bűncselekménynek, miközben elkövették, és a normához vezetik őket, és megesküsznek, hogy az igazat, a teljes igazat és csakis az igazat mondják, Isten úgy segélje őket. És a kérdésükben azt állítják, hogy: "Láttam azt az embert a bankban május huszonharmadikán. Láttam, hogy fegyvert rántott a kabátjából. Hallottam, hogy követeli, hogy az összes pénzt adják neki. Láttam őt, amikor elhagyta a bankot. Láttam, ahogy a tiszt elfogja odakint." És ha rá tud venni három vagy négy tanút, hogy mutasson rá arra az emberre, és keresztkérdések mellett tartsa meg a vallomásukat, akkor azt az embert bűnösnek ítélik. Ő az, aki ezt tette. Két vagy három tanúnk van, akik ugyanarról az emberről tanúskodnak, és tényként fogadják el, hogy ő követte el a bűncselekményt, és bűnös.<br/>Jézus halála után, amikor feltámadt, sok különböző embernek jelent meg, akik eskü alatt bizonyságot tettek arról, hogy látták őt. Hogy beszéltek vele, hogy különböző helyeken különböző körülmények között jelent meg nekik. És negyven napon át meglátogatá õket. És egy idõben, akár ötszáz ember is, a kik egy helyre gyűltek, megjelenék. Nehéz ezeknek az embereknek a bizonyságtételét csak félredobni vagy megtagadni. Ez azt jelenti, hogy hiteltelenné tesszük az egész joggyakorlatunkat. De nem csak ezek az emberek, akik bizonyságot tettek arról, hogy látták a feltámadt Urat, hogy beszéltek vele, hogy együtt ettek vele, hanem mindannyian, egy kivételével, erőszakos halállal találkoztak más emberek kezétől, mert megerősítették, hogy a történet, amit mondtak, igaz volt. Olyan tanúkról beszélsz, akik esküt tettek, hogy az igazat, a teljes igazat, csakis az igazat mondják. Bevallották volna az egész átverésnek. "Sok csalhatatlan bizonyítékkal mutatta meg magát a szenvedélye után."<br/>Látták őket negyven napig, és beszéltek nekik az Isten országára vonatkozó dolgokról (ApCsel 1:3).<br/>Néha hibáztatjuk a tanítványokat az Isten királyságának időzítésével kapcsolatos kérdéseik miatt. Emlékezzünk arra, hogy Isten királysága Jézus Krisztus kedvenc témája volt. Mindig Isten királyságáról beszélt, és nagy remény, hogy minden ember szívébe ültetett. A dolgok nem mindig fognak továbbra is romlottak lenni, mint ők. A világ nem megy örökké a sötétség hatalma alatt, a gonosz rabsága alatt. Isten egy nap megalapítja királyságát a földön. Az igazságos öröm és béke királysága. "Jézus fog uralkodni, mielőtt a nap fut az ő egymást követő utak. És az ő királysága kiterjed parttól partig." És ez a nap lesz a legdicsőségesebb nap, amit a világ valaha látott, mivel a betegség, a szenvedés és a fájdalom el lesz törölve az Ő országában. Az istentelen kommercializmus, az ember kizsákmányolása, mindezek eltörölve az Ő dicsőséges királyságában, amikor Ő uralkodik. Nem csoda, hogy a tanítványok alig várták, hogy megkapják. Alig várom, hogy folytassam; Nagyon aggódom, hogy jöjjön el az Ő királysága. És Jézus azt mondta nekünk, amikor imádkozunk, az első kérés: "Jöjjön el a királyságod. Legyen meg a te akaratod a földön, amint a mennyben" (Mt 6:10). Ez a megfelelő fajta vágy, hogy mindannyiunknak legyen. Kívánom az Isten királyságát. És így szólt hozzájuk, ebben a negyven napos időszakban, az országról.<br/>És egybegyűlvén velök, megparancsolá nékik, hogy el ne távozzanak Jeruzsálemből, hanem várjanak az Atyának ígéretére, a melyről azt mondja, hogy hallottatok felőlem (ApCsel 1,4).<br/>Azt mondta: "Nézzétek, várjatok itt Jeruzsálemben, amíg megkapjátok az Atya ígéretét." Ez az ígéret, amelyre utal, kétségtelenül az az ígéret Joelben, ahol az Úr megígérte: "És lészen a későbbi napokban, azt mondja az Úr, hogy kitöltöm az én Lelkemet minden testre; és a te fiaid és leányaid prófétálnak, és a te ifjaid álmodnak, a te véneid látomásokat látnak; és az én szolgáimra és szolgálóleányaimra kitöltöm az én Lelkemet, azt mondja az Úr" (Joe 2:28-29). Az Atya ígérete: eljön a nap, amikor Isten kiárasztja az Ő Lelkét minden testre, minden hívőre. Mindegyikük megkapja Istentől ezt a dinamikát.<br/>Mert János valóban vízzel keresztelkedett meg, de ti nem sok nap múlva Szentlélekkel keresztelkedtek meg (ApCsel 1:5).<br/>A keresztség gondolata az emersion, a bapteedzo volt. János vízzel keresztelve, vízbe merítve az embereket, "nem sok nap múlva a Szentlélekben merülsz el."<br/>Amikor azért egybegyűltek, kérték őt, mondván: Uram, visszaadod-e ebben az időben a királyságot Izraelnek?<br/>"Mikor lesz, Uram? Mikor van itt az ideje ennek a helyreállításnak?" És Jézus most nem az országról beszél nekik, hanem arról a hatalomról, amelyet szolgálatra fognak kapni. És így félreteszi a kérdésüket.<br/>Mondván nékik: Nem a ti dolgotok tudni az időket és az idõszakokat, a melyeket az Atya a maga hatalmába helyezett (ApCsel 1,7).<br/>"Nem a ti dolgotok, hogy tudjátok." Folyamatosan az ország azonnali felállításának várásában éltek. Jézus egész élete alatt azt várták, hogy Jézus bármelyik pillanatban bemegy a telefonfülkébe és kijön, mint a világ megmentője. Shazzam! Megmutatta hatalmát és megdöntötte a világ kormányait, megalapozva Isten királyságát a földön. És naponta várták, hogy ez a változás megtörténjen. És valahányszor Jézus arról beszélt, hogy Jeruzsálembe megy, a bűnös ember kezébe kerül, majd keresztre feszítik, "Ó, nem, Uram. Nem, nem érted a királyságot, Uram. Légy olyan távol Tőled." Amikor Jézus meghalt a kereszten, mindannyian nagyon csalódottak voltak.<br/>A két tanítvány az Emmauszba vezető úton, oly szomorúan. - Hé, cimborák. - Hogy-hogy olyan szomorúak vagytok, mint ahogy haladtok? - Hogy értitek? - Idegennek kell itt lennetek, ha nem tudjátok, mi történt mostanában Jeruzsálemben. - Miféle dolgok? "Ó, egy fickó, a neve Jézus a Názáreti ... oh ember, ez volt hatalmas és hatalmas. A kenet Isten volt az ő életében. Azt reméltük, hogy benne volt a szabadulás Izrael, de keresztre feszítették. Azt reméltük . . . most halott." Most feltámadt, és azt mondja: "Néhány nap múlva, srácok, megkapjátok az Atya ígéretét." "Ó, milyen ígéret? Az ország megalapításának ígérete?" Látjátok, jogos volt, hogy megkérdezzék. "Ez az, Uram? Rendben! Most van itt az ideje? Most állítod fel a királyságodat? "Nem. Nem neked kell tudnod azokat az időket, amikor az Atya kijelölte, vagy hogy az Atya a saját hatalmában van. De erőt kapsz, amikor a Szentlélek eljött rád."<br/>Nos, itt a görög epi elöljárószót használják, hogy jelezzék egy új kapcsolatukat a Szentlélekkel. János evangéliumának 14. fejezete szerint, amikor Jézus megígéri, hogy elküldi a Szentlelket, ezt mondta: "Nem hagylak titeket vigasztalatlanul. Elmegyek hozzátok, és imádkozom az Atyához, és ő más vigasztalót küld hozzátok, az igazság Lelkét, akit a világ nem tud befogadni, mert nem ismeri őt, hanem ismeritek őt, mert nálatok lakik, és bennetek lesz” (Jn 14,17-18). Ugyanaz a görög prepozíció, mint a miénk, csak "en" -nek írják a "ben" helyett. Kettős kapcsolat van Jánosban: Ő veled van, de benned fog lakni. De most Jézus azt mondta, hogy erőt fogsz kapni, amikor a Szentlélek jön rád. A görög epi elöljárószó, amelyet az Újszövetség különböző szövegei úgy fordítanak le, hogy "felül" vagy "felül" vagy tetszik, "túlcsordul".<br/>János evangéliumának hetedik fejezetében: "Az utolsó napon, az ünnep nagy napján, amikor Jézus ott állt a Templom-hegyen, és így kiáltott a néphez: Ha valaki szomjúhozik, jöjjön hozzám és igyék; és aki abból a vízből iszik, amelyet én adok, annak legbensőbb lényéből élő víz árad." János pedig monda: Ez a Lélekrõl szólott, a mely még meg nem adatott, a melyet a benne hívõk kapnak (Jn 7:37-39). Mit szólott a Lélekrõl? Hogy olyan lesz, mint az élõ víz patakja, a mely kifolyik. Azt szeretem: "Amikor a Lélek túlcsordul rajtad, vagy rajtad, vagy túlcsordul tőled." Tehát a hármas kapcsolat: Ő veled van a megtérésed előtt, Ő az, aki rádöbbent, hogy bűnös vagy, Ő az, aki Jézus Krisztusra mutat válaszként, miközben meggyőzi a világot a bűnről, az igazról és az ítéletről. Abban a pillanatban, amikor megnyitjátok életeteket és szíveteket Jézus Krisztusnak, és meghívjátok Őt, hogy jöjjön be, a Szentlélek eljön és elkezd benned lakozni. Ő lesz bennetek. Nem tudjátok-é, hogy nem vagytok magatokéi, áron vétettetek meg, azért dicsőítsétek az Istent testetekben és lelketekben, a melyek az Övéi. És nem tudjátok-é, hogy a ti testetek a Szent Lélek temploma, a mely ti bennetek van? Ne részegedjetek meg a bortól, amelyben a felesleg van, hanem töltekezzetek be, vagy töltekezzetek be a Lélekkel” (1Kor 6,19-20, Ef 5,18). De most itt van egy harmadik kapcsolat. Ez egy felhatalmazó tapasztalat.<br/>A dinamikát megkapjátok, amikor a Szentlélek eljön hozzátok [vagy felettetek, vagy amikor túlcsordul tőletek], és tanúi lesztek nekem (ApCsel 1,8).<br/>És így a dinamikus, hogy tanúja legyen Jézus Krisztus. Érdekes, hogy a szó tanú görögül a szó martus ahonnan kapjuk a szó mártír. És a görög azt jelenti, mártír. Tanú az, aki nem csak hirdeti, amit hisz, éli, amit hisz, ő az, amit hisz, és olyan erősen hiszi, hogy ha kell, meghal azért, amit hisz. Ennyire erős a hite. martus. Nem lehet megállítani, nem fél attól, hogy meghaljon azért, amiben hisz.<br/>Emlékszel, amikor Pál úton volt Jeruzsálembe, és Agabus lejött Cezáreából, fogta Pál övét, megkötözte magát, és így szólt: "Így az az ember, akié ez az öv, hogy megkötözzék, amikor Jeruzsálembe ér." És Pál barátai sírni kezdének, mondván: "Ó, Pál, ne menj, ne menj." És monda: "Mit értesz e könnyek alatt? Azt hiszed, hogy le fogsz beszélni? Azt hiszed, hogy aggódom a megkötözés miatt? Kész vagyok meghalni." Mártusz volt. "Kész vagyok meghalni." Halálra ítélve a hitedért nem tett mártírrá; mert mártír voltál, halálra ítéltek. Mert tanú voltál, mert olyan erősnek hitted. Tehát nem tett tanúvá, csak azt bizonyította, ami volt. Végig tanú volt. Ha nem lett volna martus, soha nem ment volna a halálba. Visszavonta volna; azt mondta volna: "Hé, várj, várj. Tarts ki, változtassunk irányt itt. Azt hiszem, hogy talán tévedtem. Aztán azt mondod: "Nos, nem volt martus. Lólopás nem tesz lótolvajrá; csak azt bizonyítja, hogy voltál. Senki sem lop lovat, hacsak nem lótolvaj. Tehát a lopás nem tesz lótolvajrá, csak azt bizonyítja, hogy mindvégig az voltál. Mártírnak lenni is csak azt bizonyítja, ami tanú voltál, martus. - És tanúk lesztek. - És nem érdekes-e, hogy a legtöbbjük mártír volt? - Tanúk nekem.<br/>A tanúságtételnek Jeruzsálemben és egész Júdeában kellett történnie (ApCsel 1:8).<br/>A tanúságtétel otthon kezdődött. A legnehezebb hely, nem igaz? Jeruzsálemben, majd Jeruzsálem környékén, Júdea területén. És aztán elterjedt Szamáriában. Aztán ki kellett menni a világ legtávolabbi részeibe. És ahogy tanulmányozzuk az Apostolok cselekedeteinek könyvét, látni fogjuk ezt a fejlődést. Hogyan kezdődött a tanúságtétel Jeruzsálemben. Ezt a következő fejezetben kapjuk meg. Aztán meglátjuk, hogyan kezdett elterjedni Júdeában, aztán Fülöp felment Samáriába, és végül Pál és Barnabás elhívást kaptak, hogy elmenjenek a világ legtávolabbi részébe. Így a tanúságtétel a Szentlélek kenete és felhatalmazása által terjedt el.<br/>Mikor pedig ezeket mondta, mikor látták, felvitetett, és felhő fogadta őt szem elől” (ApCsel 1:9).<br/>Ez az utolsó ígéret, amelyet Jézus tett tanítványainak. Ez az, az utolsó szavak a felemelkedése előtt. Természetesen később jött és beszélt Pállal és másokkal, de felemelkedése előtt ez az utolsó szava. És amikor ezeket mondta, mialatt őt nézték, felemeltetett, és felhő fogadta őt szem elől.<br/>Amikor pedig az ég felé tekintettek, amikor felment, íme, két férfi állt mellettük fehér ruhában (ApCsel 1,10).<br/>Feltételezzük, hogy angyalok voltak.<br/>És monda: Galileai férfiak, miért bámultok fel a mennybe? Ez a Jézus, a ki felvétetett ti közületek a mennybe, úgy jõ el, a mint láttátok õt felmenni a mennybe (ApCsel 1:11).<br/>Látták őt, amint felment a mennybe, és látni fogják őt, amikor újra eljön. "Íme, az Úr jön tízezer szentjével, hogy végrehajtsa az ítéletet a földön" (Júdás 1,14-15). És akkor: "Annak, aki szeretett minket, és önmagát adta értünk, és aki minket a mi Istenünknek teremtett, királyok és papok, akik vele uralkodnak a földön, íme az Úr eljön, és minden szem meglátja őt, és azok is, akik átszúrták őt, gyászolni fognak" (Jel 1:5-7). Tehát az Úr eljövetele. Minden szem meglátja őt. A Jehova tanúk azt mondják, hogy már eljött, de ez egy titok volt. Mivel csak a tanítványok látták őt elmenni, csak a Jehova tanúinak tanítványai látták őt visszatérni. Jézus pedig monda: Ha azt mondják néktek: Titokban jött és titkos szobába ment, ne higyjétek” (Mt 24:26). Választhattok tehát, hogy hisztek-e Jézusnak vagy nékik.<br/>"Ez a Jézus, aki felvitetett tőletek a mennybe, úgy fog eljönni, ahogy láttátok őt felmenni a mennybe."<br/>Most van egy nagyon érdekes vers II János, vers ApCsel 1:7 , "Mert sok csalók jöttek a világba, akik nem vallják, hogy Jézus Krisztus testben jött." Ez, sajnos, egy rossz fordítása a görög. Mert ez a participle a jelen időben van, és azt kell fordítani, hogy "eljön a testben". Azok, akik tagadják, hogy Jézus Krisztus jön a testben. Mit mond róluk János? "Ők csaló és antikrisztus. Vigyázzatok magatokra, hogy el ne veszítsük azokat, a miket cselekedtünk, hanem teljes jutalmat nyerjünk; mert a ki vétkezik és nem marad a Krisztus tanításában, annak nincsen Istene. A ki megmarad a Krisztus tantételében, azé az Atya és a Fiú is. És ha valaki bemegy a ti kaputokhoz (szombat reggel), és nem viszi be e tantételt, ne fogadjátok be őt a ti házatokba, és el ne búcsúzzatok tőle. Mert aki elbúcsúzik tőle, az a gonosz cselekedeteinek részese” (2Jn 1:7-11). Kérdezz meg tőlük egy kérdést: "Jön-e Jézus testben?" Csak kérdezd meg tőlük ezt a kérdést. És ha nemet mondanak, emlékezz arra, amit János figyelmeztetett téged, és amit János mondott neked. "Ha valaki nem vallja, hogy Jézus Krisztus testben jön el." Emlékszel, amikor a tanítványokkal volt, és azt mondta: "Adj nekem valamit enni"? Azt mondta: "Tudod, a szellemek nem esznek; érints meg. Látod? Én vagyok." Tehát ugyanaz a Jézus ugyanúgy jön vissza, mint ahogy látták őt a mennybe menni. És én személy szerint hiszem, hogy ez az eljövetel nagyon hamar eljön.<br/>Azután Jeruzsálembe tértek az Olajfák hegyéről, amely Jeruzsálemből a szombat napi útra [mintegy kétharmad mérföld]. És bemenvén, felmenének egy emeleti szobába, a hol Péter, Jakab, János, András, Filep, Tamás, Bertalan, Máté, Jakab, Alfeus fia, Zélóta Simon és Júdás, Jakab testvére. És ezek mindnyájan egy szívvel-lélekkel imádkoztak és könyörögtek az asszonyokkal és Máriával, Jézus anyjával és testvéreivel (ApCsel 1,12-14).<br/>Ez Mária, Jézus anyja utolsó említése. Ezen a ponton és ettől a ponttól kezdve nincs további említés róla az Apostolok cselekedeteiben vagy a levelekben. Nincs említés a haláláról vagy a mennybe való csodálatos felemelkedéséről, halál nélkül. Az Írásban semmi sem kerül említésre.<br/>A testvérei valószínűleg Jakabra és Júdásra, valamint azokra a többi testvérre utaltak, akik József és Mária fiai voltak.<br/>A felső szoba - vannak, akik azt mondják, hogy ez ugyanaz a felső szoba, amelyben Jézus az utolsó vacsorát tartotta a tanítványaival. És mégis, vannak mások, akik úgy tartják, hogy ez a felső szoba egy szoba a templom területén, ahol a korai egyház találkozott. Te döntesz.<br/>És azokban a napokban Péter felállt a tanítványok között, és azt mondta: (az ő neveiknek száma együttesen mintegy százhúsz) férfiak és testvérek, ennek az Írásnak be kellett teljesednie, amelyet a Szentlélek Dávid szája által mondott korábban Júdásról, aki útmutató volt azoknak, akik elvitték Jézust (ApCsel 1,15-16).<br/>Itt is Péter még mindig ugyanaz a heves énje. Imában és könyörgésben várakoznak, Péter feláll, és azt mondja: "Fiúk, van egy szentírás, amit be kell teljesíteni." És tudod, hogy előre fog haladni, "Lássuk a programot; sorsoljuk ki a sorsot, és derítsük ki, ki fogja átvenni Júdás helyét." Úgy érzem, hogy Péter ismét testben volt, kinyilvánítva azt a heves természetet, ami az övé volt. És azt hiszem, hogy az egyház jövőbeli története az Apostolok Cselekedetei könyvében rámutat erre. Érdekel, hogy Péter megérti-e a szentírásokat, hogyan idéz az Ószövetségben oly sok helyről. Péter nagyon jól ismeri az ószövetségi írásokat, ami az ő javát szolgálja.<br/>Figyeljük meg, hogy Péter tulajdonítja, hogy a Szentlélek azokat a dolgokat, hogy Dávid írta. Így, "Minden írás van adva az ihletés az Isten" (2Ti 3:16 ). Nem része az írásokat. Mert ha azt mondod nekem, hogy a szentírások egy részét Isten ihlette, akkor meg kell kérdeznem tőled: "Mely részek ihletnek, és melyek nem ihletnek?" És aztán te vagy a hatóság, aki megmondja, hogy melyik részben hihetek, és melyikben nem, és abban a pillanatban, hogy Isten már nem a hatóság, hanem te vagy a hatóság, bajban vagyok. Óvakodjatok azoktól, akik azt mondják: "Nos, nem hiheted el az összes szentírást." Maguk az írások azt mondják: "Minden szentírás Istentől ihletett." És itt Lukács, amikor arról ír, amit Péter mondott, kijelenti, hogy valójában Dávid volt a Szentlélek szószólója. A Szentlélek Dávid szájából Júdásról beszélt.<br/>Mert megszámláltatott nékünk, [egy volt a tizenkettő közül] e szolgálatból; de ez az ember most vett egy szántóföldet, a melyen hamisság jutalma volt, és fejest ugrott (ApCsel 1,17-18).<br/>Megvette a mezőt, a fazekas mezejét, ahogy Zakariás a tizenegyedik fejezet kijelenti.<br/>És hanyatt-homlok roskadt, széthasadt középen, és minden bele kiömlött (ApCsel 1:18).<br/>Vannak olyanok, akik ellentmondást találnak a szentírásokban, mert az egyik evangéliumban azt mondják, hogy amikor Júdás visszatért, és megpróbálta visszaadni a pénzt, azt mondták: "Hé, ez a te problémád. Nem tudjuk elvenni." És tedd vissza a templom kincstárába. "Ez vérpénz." Aztán odadobta a templom padlójára, és kiment, és felakasztotta magát. Itt Peter elmondja, hogy fejjel lefelé esett, és csak felrobbant. És vannak olyanok, akik ellentmondást képzelnek el. Nagyon egyszerű, felment a fára, hogy felakassza magát, a nyakába kötötte a kötelet, és a végtagjához kötötte, és ugrott. És az esés ereje vagy eltörte a kötelet vagy a fejét, és leesett a kanyonba, és ahogy itt mondta.<br/>Jeruzsálem minden lakója előtt ismeretes volt, olyannyira, hogy a mezőt az ő nyelvükön hívják, Aceldamának, azaz a vér mezejének. Mert meg van írva a Zsoltárok könyvében: Legyen puszta az ő hajléka, és senki se lakjék abban; és az ő püspöksége másé legyen (ApCsel 1,19-20).<br/>A valóságban két különböző zsoltárt idéz itt. A Zsolt 69:25-ből összefoglalja a Zsolt 109:8-cal. És összerakva a kettőt, ezeket a próféciákat találja Júdásról.<br/>Ezeknek az embereknek (ApCsel 1:21)<br/>Most itt van, ahol keresnek valakit, aki elfoglalja Júdás helyét, hogy apostol legyen. Itt vannak azok a képesítések, amelyeket abban az időben kerestek.<br/>Azok közül a férfiak közül, akik velünk együtt szolgáltak egész idő alatt, amikor az Úr Jézus közöttünk volt és kijött (ApCsel 1:21).<br/>Most emlékeztek, hogy sok tanítvány volt, sok tanítvány, akik közül Jézus kiválasztott tízet, hogy apostolok legyenek. És az apostol szó azt jelenti, hogy "egy, aki ki van küldve". Vagy tizenkettőt választott apostoloknak, így elküldte a tizenkettőt. Az emberi kormányzás számát. "Csak tizenegy van. Szükségünk van valakire, aki átveszi Júdás helyét, de szükségünk van valakire, aki mindvégig velünk volt Jézussal."<br/>Attól a naptól kezdve, hogy János megkeresztelte őt, egészen addig a napig, amíg fel nem vette tőlünk, el kell rendelni, hogy az Ő feltámadásának tanúja legyen (ApCsel 1,22).<br/>Tehát ezek voltak a követelmények, amelyeket kerestek. Valaki, aki egész idő alatt körül volt. János keresztelésének idejétől a felemelkedésig. És aki látta a feltámadott Urat, és így el tudta viselni a feltámadás tényét, bizonyságát a tényről.<br/>Most Pál apostol, később azt a tényt, hogy ő volt az apostol, azt mondta: "Nem láttam a feltámadt Krisztust?" Nyilvánvalóan ez volt az apostolság egyik követelménye. Valaki megkérdezte tőlem: "Vannak-e apostolok ma?" Nos, nem tudom. Nem hiszem, hogy ugyanabban az értelemben vannak, mint az Újszövetségben. Bizonyára nincs ma, aki tanúságot tehet a feltámadásról, mint ők.<br/>Kineveztek kettőt, Józsefet, Barsabást, a kit Jusztusznak hívtak, és Mátyást. És imádkozának, és mondának: Te Uram, a ki minden embernek szívét ismered, mutasd meg, hogy e kettő közül, a melyet választottál (ApCsel 1,23-24).<br/>Azt hiszem, gyakran elkövetjük azt a hibát, hogy az Úrnak két választást adunk, mindkettőt. Isten korlátozása, látod. Annyira hajlamosak vagyunk erre. Nyilvánvaló, hogy Pál Isten választása volt. Peter heves volt, és azt mondta, "Hé, tennünk kell valamit, tudod, ki kell segítenünk Istent, tudod, egy hiányzik, és be kell avatnunk." És mégis, "Istenem, melyiket akarod?" És meg kell adnunk Istennek a két választást.<br/>Hogy részt vehessen ebben a szolgálatban és ebben az apostolságban, amelytől Júdás a törvényszegés miatt esett el, hogy elmenjen a maga helyére. És így adták ki sorsukat (ApCsel 1:25-26).<br/>Érdekes módja annak, hogy megpróbálták meghatározni Isten akaratát. Dobjunk kockákat, derítsük ki, mi Isten akarata itt. Érdekes számomra, hogy az emberek különböző módon tervezték meg Isten akaratát. Nos, az ószövetségi időkben volt egy érdekes módja annak, hogy elmenjenek a paphoz, aki az Urim és a Thummim, a "fények és tökéletességek" révén megkérdezte az Urat. Csak azt nem tudjuk, hogy ezek az Urim és Thummim mi volt. Biztos vagyok benne, hogy nem azok a színes szemüvegek voltak, amiket Joseph Smith talált az Arany Tablettáknál; a varázsszemüvegek, amiket ha felveszel, hirtelen el tudod olvasni a hieroglif írást.<br/>Vannak olyanok, akik azt mondják, hogy az Urim és a Thummim valójában egy fekete és egy fehér kő volt, amelyet a pap mellkasán lévő erszényben viseltek. Imádkoztak, és megkérdeztek az Úrtól egy adott kérdést. Emlékszel, hogy Dávid határozott kérdéseket tett fel az Úrnak: "Uram, menjünk ki a filiszteusok ellen?" A válasz ez volt: "Nem." Másnap ismét: "Uram, menjünk ki a filiszteusok ellen?" A válasz ez volt: "Igen." "Mikor menjünk?" Konkrét kérdéseket tettek fel, és az Úr az Urimon és a Thumminon keresztül irányította őket. Azt mondják, hogy a pap imádkozik, keresi Istent, majd benyúl és kihúzza a két kő egyikét. Ha a fehér kő volt, akkor igen válasz volt. Ha ez egy nem, akkor ez lenne a fekete kő, hogy ő húzza ki. Néhányan még azt mondják, kap a kifejezés blackballed ettől Urim és Thummim. Valójában, vissza az eredeti ez egy nem szavazat ellen egy adott projekt vagy ötlet. Azt, hogy mi volt az Urim és Tummim, nem tudjuk, de az ószövetségi időszakban egy sorsvetési módszert használtak Isten akaratának meghatározására.<br/>Tehát itt a tanítványok ugyanazt a dolgot fogják fel, mint amikor dobják a kockát, hogy megnézzék, hogy a két ember közül, akiket Isten kiválasztott, hogy Karióti Júdás helyébe lépjen.<br/>Mátyásra esett a sors; a tizenegyessel volt megszámlálva (ApCsel 1:26).<br/>Nos, ki a világon Mátyás? Senki sem hallott róla sem előtte, sem azóta. Érdekes lesz találkozni Mátyással, és megtudni, hogy ki ő és mit tett. Azt hiszem, a későbbi történelemből nyilvánvaló, hogy Isten Pált apostolnak választotta. Pál maga jelenti ki. Most olvasunk róluk utoljára, hogy Isten akaratát sorsvetéssel vagy valami véletlenséggel akarják felismerni.<br/>Ismerek ma egy embert, aki arra törekszik, hogy felismerje az Úr akaratát, imádkozni fog, és feltesz egy kérdést az Úrnak. Tíz fillér lesz a zsebében, és miközben imádkozik, csukott szemmel fogja a filléreket, és leteszi az asztalra, és ha mind feljön a fejére, az igen. Egy érdekes dolog, néha-néha, mind feljönnek fejek, és ez elég jó esély. Mégis, nem találunk semmilyen mintát erre, miután a Szentlelket megkaptuk. Amikor a Szentlélek leszállt az egyházra, a Szentlélek beszélni kezdett hozzájuk, és irányította őket. A Szentlélek így szólt: "Különböztessétek el tőlem Pált és Barnabást a szolgálatra, ahová hívtam őket" (ApCsel 13:2). És a Szentlélek elküldte őket. Tehát úgy találjuk, hogy az egyházat közvetlenül a Szentlélek irányítja. Miután a Szentlélek eljött, ez a dobott kocka, hogy megtudja, Isten akarata félre lett állítva.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James verzió<br/><br/>Ez az 1769-es King James Version of the Holy Bible (más néven az Authorized Version). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Egy dinamikus meghajtó belsejében van egy mágnes, és amikor csatlakoztatja a fejhallgatót, egy AC áramot küld rajta keresztül, amely a hangtekercset mágnessé alakítja. Az áram irányától függően a mágnes polaritása megváltozik. Mivel tudjuk, hogy mágnesről van szó, ugyanaz a töltés visszaverődik, és különböző töltések vonzzák egymást, tudjuk, hogy a hangtekercs előre-hátra mozog, az akkori polaritásától függően. A hangtekercs a membránhoz van rögzítve, amely aztán előre-hátra mozog, és hanghullámot hoz létre. Ugyanez történik fordítva, ha egy tekercset mágnesen keresztül mozgat, akkor áramot termel.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Azonban potenciálisan korlátozott, mivel az elsődleges adatok nagy részét nyilvánvaló politikai hozzáállással és rejtett napirendekkel írják.<br/>Sztálin a bolsevik párt politikai megsemmisítését okozta. Lenin 1924-es halála után az eredeti párt ... a dokumentum közepén ...<br/><br/>Ő irányította az emberek életének minden aspektusát; a Kultúrát; a karriereket és a munkahelyeket, még ott is, ahol éltek (kollektivizálás).<br/>Az a fizikai kár, amit a pártnak a kirakatperek okoztak, a bolsevik eszméknek az orosz politikában való politikai érvényre juttatását is sértette. Sztálin ellenzékét a párton belül, beleértve Buharint, Jagodát és Rikovot is, ezekben a kirakatperekben tisztították meg, mivel Sztálin manipulatívan kényszerítette őket, hogy bevallják a puccs megtervezésének és az állammal szembeni bűncselekményeket, még akkor is, ha nem volt bizonyíték. Gabor T. Rittersporn azt mondta: "Az áldozatok közül sokan őszintén elkötelezték magukat a bolsevizmus elvei mellett." Ez megerősíti annak bizonyítékát, hogy a bolsevik eszméket, amelyek egykor a kommunista párt gyökerei voltak, a tisztogatások megzavarták és elpusztították. A párt megfogyatkozott, és a volt tagok tehetetlenül nézték, ahogy Sztálin a nagy tisztogatást eszközként használja, hogy Oroszországot egypártrendszerű államból vitathatatlan diktatúrává alakítsa át. A tisztogatások ismét szétzúzták a bolsevik forradalom alatt megalakult kommunista párt kereteit. Ez összhangban van a "Sztálin a hóhér" forrással, mivel mindkettő manipulatív jelleget mutat, ami segített a diktátornak, hogy növelje az orosz torkát.<br/>Az a manipulatív mód, amellyel Sztálin a tisztogatások során célzott ellenzékét a hétköznapi oroszok szemében is gyanúba keverte, szintén implózív hatást gyakorolt a szovjet társadalomra. Sztálin a propaganda és a média segítségével tudta összegyűjteni a nép támogatását, hogy segítsen neki kifejleszteni a "személyiség kultuszát" és a hősies és bátor vezető képét. Ezzel a támogatással Sztálin bizalmatlanságot ültetett az emberek elméjébe, meggyőzve őket arról, hogy a forradalom árulói és az, amit a "nép ellenségeinek" nevezett, köztük voltak.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Szupercella nerfing verekedők helyett nerfing csillag hatáskörök. Voltam 750 tavaly power 8 nita, és ez nagyon nehéz, hogy menjen túl, mint a csillag hatáskörök játszanak igazán domináns szerepet. A partnerkereső is szemét. Amikor gem grab-ot játszom (kb. 600 trófea), gyakran vannak olyan mérkőzések, ahol az ellenséges csapatnak egynél több játékosa van, mint nekünk, és nem is arról van szó, hogy egy lvl 9-et kell versenyeznünk. Néha vannak még matchup, ahol az ellenséges csapat teljesen maxed, és egyikünk sem. ezért dont játszani verekedés csillagok komolyan többé. Ez nem is olyan, mint nincs sok játékos, aki nem maxed és mintegy 600 trófeát. Ez bosszantó.<br/>Edit: Úgy gondolom, hogy a szupercellának legalább egy alapvető mechanizmussal kell rendelkeznie, amely a verekedők szintjének átlagát veszi fel a mérkőzések beállításakor.<br/><br/>Kivéve, hogy a trófeák nem a te képességedet mutatják, hanem a csapattársak képességeit, akikkel együtt vagy. És én nem bánom, hogy magasabb szintű verekedők ellen kell játszanom, de amikor az egyik csapat mind 10-es szintű, a másik pedig nem, az nyilvánvalóan kiegyensúlyozatlan.<br/><br/>Javaslom, hogy néhány jó barátot játszhassak, én és 2 barátom a barátaimnak 1 kullancsot adtak a 28. helyre azáltal, hogy egész nap egy bizonyos összetételű gem grab-ot játszottunk, és anélkül tettük meg, hogy egyetlen emberünk maximalizálta volna a verekedéseinket.<br/><br/>Tudom, hogy mit érzel, hogy régen magas trófeákban harcolók voltak alacsony szinten, és nehéz továbbmenni, és mindent, amit mondtam magamnak: "Csillagerőket akarok" valóban szupercellának kell egyensúlyoznia a csillagerőkkel, vagy legalábbis jobb párosítási rendszert kell készítenie.<br/><br/>Ezt érzem. Nem vagyok olyan jó a játékban, mint te, de Emz-t 500-ra tettem az 1-es teljesítménynél, és a mérkőzések szörnyűek voltak. A játékosok mindenhol ki vannak téve! És nem segített, hogy a csapattársaim többsége körülbelül 5-8 ezer trófeával rendelkezett... Az utolsó pillanatban egyéni leszámoláshoz kellett folyamodnom, mert vagy lesből támadok gyanútlan játékosokat, vagy egyszerűen csak egy kicsit agresszíven játszom a megfelelő időben. De nagyon szeretném, ha egy kicsit könnyebb lenne azoknak, akik igazán magas trófeákra akarják kényszeríteni a verekedőket anélkül, hogy a csillagerők luxusával rendelkeznének.<br/><br/>Altho tüske még mindig jó nélkül curveball. Curveball csak egy segítség ütő a lövések gyakrabban tüske. De még mielőtt curveball megjelent, tüske volt egy nagyon erős verekedő, így ő marad a most ugyanaz.<br/><br/>Egyetértek azzal, hogy meg kellett volna nerfed rajtaütés, de azt hiszem, megpróbálják egyensúlyt mind Snappy Sniping és Ambush, mivel mindketten egyre összeolvadt ezzel a változással. Ő lett egy kicsit erős, de még mindig nem nerf-méltó<br/><br/>Nem vagyok biztos benne, de most, hogy Darryl észrevehető buffot kapott, az új statisztikáikat tekintve úgy tűnik, hogy Darryl elhomályosíthatja Bullt, mivel nemcsak mindig több kárt tud okozni, mint Bull, nem fog meghalni olyan korán, így túlélésük hasonló lesz csillagerő nélkül (bár Bull túlélése még mindig észrevehetően jobb, mint Darryl, ha Tough Guy volt). Nem csak ez, Darryl szuper képes auto regenerálódni, ami azt jelenti, Darryl képes lehet hatékonyan játszani, mint egy nehézsúlyú és egy bérgyilkos egyszerre (mielőtt szar, mint egy nehézsúlyú, de tisztességes, mint egy bérgyilkos)<br/><br/>De ő túlértékelt af. És akkor kap trófeák vele nagyon könnyen. Szóval im kicsit rendben van a nerf. Még nem is játszott vele, mivel amikor kaptam neki, hogy 500 (körülbelül 5 hónappal ezelőtt), így nem, hogy érdekel, hogy sem.<br/><br/>Miért nem kap a Poco/Penny HP nerf-et, ha Marksman/Healer, illetve nem tank?<br/>Miért nem idegesít Rosa tankossága, miért nem köhög 70%-os sebzéscsökkentéssel?<br/>Miért van az, hogy a Tick-nek van a legmagasabb hatótávolsága és a legszabadabb pokedamage-je az egész játékban?<br/>Miért nem kap Leon egy HP/Damage buffot?<br/><br/>Bárhogy is legyen, az Ambush volt az OP, nem pedig a Piper bázis. Azt állítanám, hogy az Ambush a legjobb csillagerő a játékban (most még inkább, mivel a károk százalékos növekedése közvetetten emelkedett), és az alap Piper volt az alsó-10 veszekedő.<br/><br/>A Supercell-nek vissza kell fordítania mindkét nerf-et, csökkentenie kell az Ambush-t 600-ra, és csökkentenie kell a Snappy Sniping-et 0,25-re, mivel közvetetten az alap kár buff.<br/><br/>Igen, és azt hiszem, hogy egy kicsit túl messzire mentek Rosával, mert most már ő a jobb bika, ha tankolásról van szó, ami már egy ideje volt.<br/><br/>Miért? Úgy érzem, szüksége van egy buff szinte minden, kivéve a csillag erejét. Az egészsége és a sebesség, hogy ő szuper egy kicsit nehezebb használni, mert ő is meghal elég könnyen, és ez nagyon nehéz neki, hogy csapdába gyorsabb verekedők, mint Crow. A sztárok ereje egy kicsit elromlott... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Önfoglalkoztatás 1. rész<br/><br/>Ha elfogad egy munkát bármely szervezetben, akkor különböző munkákat kell végeznie a munkáltató igényei szerint, és fizetésként fix jövedelmet kaphat.
