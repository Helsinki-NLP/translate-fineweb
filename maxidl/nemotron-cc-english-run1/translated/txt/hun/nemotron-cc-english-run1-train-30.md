Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Bejegyzés navigáció<br/><br/>Az "Élet papírok nélkül" elnyerte a legjobb írás díját<br/><br/>A Len Grant által létrehozott "Life Without Papers" blogprojektben dokumentálatlan migráns családok és fiatalok történetei szerepelnek. A nem dokumentált migránsoknak nincs semmijük. Nem dolgozhatnak. Nincs joguk állami juttatásokhoz vagy lakóhelyhez. Ők jelenleg a legsérülékenyebb csoport az Egyesült Királyságban.<br/><br/>Az okmányokkal nem rendelkező (vagy irreguláris) migránsok közé tartoznak a szexkereskedelembe vagy a házi szolgaságba csempészettek; ezek közé tartoznak a vízummal túltartózkodók; azok, akiknek menedékjog iránti kérelmét elutasították, és mások, akik a bevándorlási rendszer hiányosságainak voltak kitéve. Ezek mindegyike eredetileg legálisan érkezhetett az Egyesült Királyságba.<br/><br/>Az "illegális bevándorlók” – akikről azt képzelték, hogy teherautók hátán érkeztek az országba – az okmányokkal nem rendelkezők egy kis részét teszik ki.<br/><br/>Egyes források azt sugallják, hogy a becslések szerint az Egyesült Királyságban élő 120 000 nem dokumentált gyermek fele valójában okmányokkal nem rendelkező szülőknek született. Ezek a gyermekek születésüktől fogva hátrányos helyzetben vannak, kizárólag bevándorlási státuszuk miatt.<br/><br/>A blog a nem dokumentált történeteket meséli el. Kiemeli a napi küzdelmeiket és sebezhetőségüket, de az erejüket és rugalmasságukat is. Ez nem könnyű olvasmány.<br/><br/>A blogot weboldalunkon keresztül érheti el (a jobb oldali oszlop alján a kezdőlapon).<br/><br/>A blog elnyerte a Beszélő Együtt média díjak online kategóriáját. A díjak az idei évben új kiegészítést jelentettek az Év Migráns és Menekült Nője Díjak ünnepségén a londoni Royal Festival Hall-ban a Nemzetközi Nőnap részeként. A zsűri – köztük Gillian Slovo regény- és drámaíró, valamint Hannah Pool újságíró és szerző – különösen olyan munkát keresett, amely megkérdőjelezte a mítoszokat és a sztereotípiákat.<br/><br/>A blog megnyerte a 2013-as Blog North Awards-ot is a Best Writing kategóriában, valamint az Amnesty International Media Award jelöltje is volt. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath iskolai lecke<br/><br/>A Galáciában Pál olyan kérdésekkel foglalkozik, mint a szabadság, a törvény szerepe az üdvösségben, a Krisztusban való állapotunk és a Lélek vezette élet természete, valamint az ősrégi kérdés: Hogyan lehet a bűnös embereket egy szent és igazságos Isten elé állítani?<br/><br/>Sok tudós úgy véli, hogy a Galata levél lehet a legkorábbi Pál levelei közül. 49-ben íródott, röviddel a híres Jeruzsálemi Tanács után (ApCsel 15). Ezért a könyv lehet a legrégebbi keresztény dokumentum. Ahogy az Apostolok Cselekedetei és a galaták világossá teszik, a korai egyház heves harcban állt az üdvösség természetéért, különösen a pogányok esetében. A zsidó hívők egy csoportja szerint, akiket judaizálóknak neveznek, a Jézusba vetett hit önmagában nem volt elég a pogányok számára. A pogányokat körül kell metélni, és követni kell Mózes törvényeit (ApCsel 15:1).<br/><br/>E negyedév bibliatanulmányozási útmutatója arra hív minket, hogy Pál apostollal együtt járjuk az utat, miközben arra kéri a galatákat, hogy maradjanak hűek Jézushoz. Esélyt ad arra is, hogy elgondolkodjunk azon igazságok megértésén, amelyek megnyitották az utat Luther Márton Rómával való végső szakítása és a bibliai evangélium helyreállítása előtt. |

Frigyest népszerűnek és intelligensnek tartották, uralkodása alatt gyönyörű feleségével, Charlotte-tal együtt a kulturális élet a kisvárosban elérte a csúcspontját. Olyan sok költő és művész töltötte ott az idejét, hogy Hildburghausent Klein-Weimarnak becézték, amikor 1825-ben Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg utolsó hercege is kiadás nélkül meghalt, a ház többi ága az ernesztinusi hercegségek átrendezése mellett döntött. 1826. november 12-én Frigyes lett Szász-Altenburg hercege, amelynek 1831-ben első alaptörvényt adott, cserébe Frigyeshez, Szász-Altenburg hercegéhez kapcsolódó média a Wikimedia Commons geneall. neten.<br/><br/>Frigyes, Szász-Altenburg hercege<br/>–<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15. köt.<br/>Charlotte Georgine mecklenburg-strelitzi hercegné<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine Hannoverben született, Brunswick-Lüneburg választókörzetében. II. Károly mecklenburgi nagyhercegnek, Charlotte-nak és lánytestvéreinek, Louise porosz királynőnek, Frederica hannoveri királynőnek és Therese thurn und taxis hercegnőnek legidősebb gyermeke és leánya volt, akiket koruk legszebb asszonyainak tartottak. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter Titan című regényét a négy szépnek ajánlotta, Charlotte Hannoverben nőtt fel, ahol apja kormányzóként szolgált sógora, III. György angol király megbízásából, aki Londonban élt. Amikor Charlotte tizenkét éves volt, édesanyja meghalt, és édesanyja nővére, Charlotte nevelte fel, aki 1784-ben feleségül vette apját, nővéreit pedig nagyanyja, Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg hozta Darmstadtban. Charlotte ekkor már Hildburghausenbe költözött. 1785. szeptember 3-án, tizenöt éves korában Charlotte feleségül ment Frigyes herceghez, Szász-Altenburg hercegéhez, a házasság nem volt boldog, Charlotte mentálisan felsőbbrendű volt Frigyesnél, aki kezdte figyelmen kívül hagyni őt. Problémáik is voltak, Szász-Hildburghausent anyagilag tönkretették Frigyes elődeinek katasztrofális politikája. A fogadók csak csökkentett polgári listát engedélyeztek a herceg és a hercegné számára, Charlottes apja és két testvére gyakran maradt Charlotte-nál Hildburghausenben. 1787-ben véglegesen Hildburghausenbe költözött, és a hitelbizottság elnöke lett. 1792-ben Charlottes nagyanyja és nővérei elmenekültek az előrenyomuló francia hadsereg elől Darmstadtból Hildburghausenbe, és nagyanyja felfigyelt Charlottes férjére. Minden feladata közül buzgalommal teljesíti házastársi kötelezettségeit. Charlotte, aki soha nem szerette ezt az embert, mindig terhes, a család több gondtalan hetet töltött Hildburghausenben. 1793-ban Charlottes nagyanyja visszatért a száműzetésből, és Charlottes nővéreivel Frankfurt am Mainba utazott, Charlotte nagyon intim és szerető kapcsolatot tartott húgával, Friederike-vel és rokonaival Strelitzben. 1803-ban és 1805-ben a porosz királyi pár látogatást tett Hildburghausenben, erre az alkalomra a fogadók megengedték a hercegi párnak, hogy felújítsák bútoraik egy részét. Louise segített megszövegezni a hadüzenetet, a keresztény Truchsea von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg a hercegi pár barátja és Charlottes fiának, Edwardnak a keresztapja volt. Sok néző jött el a bajor koronahercegnőhöz, amikor fogadta vendégeit, Truchsec megpróbálta előbb a kastélyába vezetni az alacsonyabb rangú Charlotte-ot, de ő visszautasította, lányára hivatkozva. Truchese azt felelte: "Felséged megbocsát nekem, de amíg ez a kastély itt állt, Therese megragadta a bárók másik karját, és hárman együtt sétáltak át a kapun. A hercegné jövedelmének körülbelül felét adta a szegényeknek, a nyugdíjasoknak.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Károly hessen-kasseli herceg<br/>–<br/>Károly hessen-kasseli herceg a Hesse-Kassel-ház kadét tagja és dán tábornok tábornagy volt. Rokonoknál nevelkedett a dán udvarban, élete nagy részét Dániában töltötte és édesanyja II. György brit király és Ansbachi Caroline lánya, valamint Louise dán királynő nővére volt. Apja, a későbbi földbirtokos 1747-ben elhagyta a családot, 1755-ben formálisan is véget vetett a Máriával kötött házasságnak. A nagyapa, VIII. Vilmos, Hesse tartománygrófja a Hanau grófságot és annak bevételeit Máriának, a fiatal Károly hercegnek és két testvérének, Vilmosnak és Frigyesnek, az anyjuk nevelte, és 1747-től protestáns rokonok nevelték. 1756-ban Mária Dániába költözött, hogy nővérének, Louise dán királynőnek kiskorú gyermekeit gondozza. Magával vitte fiait, akiket a koppenhágai Christiansborg palota udvarán neveltek fel. A hesseni hercegek később Dániában maradtak, fontos uraivá váltak, csak a legidősebb testvér, Vilmos tért vissza Hesse-be, 1785-ben, a szárazföldi graviátus felemelkedésével. Károly Dániában kezdte pályafutását. 1758-ban ezredessé nevezték ki, 20 éves korában, szintén 1766-ban Norvégia főkormányzójává nevezték ki, ezt a tisztséget 1768-ig töltötte be, de amely többnyire címzetes maradt, mivel ebben az időszakban soha nem ment Norvégiába. 1763-ban bátyja, Vilmos feleségül vette elsőfokú unokatestvérüket, Károly 1766. augusztus 30-án követte a példát a Christiansborg palotában – felesége Dániai Lajos volt, Károly így sógora lett unokatestvérének, VII. Keresztély királynak. A házasságra az ellene adott tanácsok ellenére került sor, Károly herceg kicsapongás vádja miatt. Nem sokkal később Károly kegyvesztett lett az udvarnál, és 1767 elején ott született meg első gyermekük, Marie Sophie, majd 1769-ben második gyermekük, William. 1768-ban Károly megvásárolta Offenbach-Rumpenheim birtokát és faluját az Edelsheim családtól. 1771-ben kastélyrá és hercegi székhellyé bővíttette a kastélyt, anyja, Mária pedig 1772-ben bekövetkezett haláláig a palotában élt. 1781-ben Károly eladta a Rumpenheim-palotát öccsének, Károly a schleswigi Gottorp kastélyban telepedett le családjával. Ott szülnék meg harmadik gyermeküket, Frigyest 1771-ben, 1770-ben VII. Keresztély király a húgának adta a gübyi Tegelhof birtokot Schleswig városa és Eckernförde között. 1772-től 1776-ig Károly nyári rezidenciát építtetett azon a helyen, amelyet felesége tiszteletére Louisenlundnak nevezett el, 1772 szeptemberében Károlyt kinevezték a norvég hadsereg főparancsnokává, és Louise-val Christianába költözött. Az engedmény III. Gusztáv svéd király 1772. augusztus 19-i államcsínyének következménye volt, míg Norvégiában Louise hercegnő 1773-ban megszülte negyedik gyermeküket, Juliane-t.<br/><br/>18. köt.<br/>Louise Caroline Hesse-Kasselből<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline a Schleswigi Hercegségben, Gottorpban született Hesse-Kassel-i Károly és felesége, Louise dán hercegnő gyermekeként.<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline hercegnő<br/><br/>19. köt.<br/>Frigyes hesseni herceg<br/>–<br/>Frigyes tartománygróf<br/><br/>20. köt.<br/>Vilmos hesseni herceg Vilmos hesseni herceg<br/>–<br/>Hesse-Kasseli Vilmos<br/><br/>212223. folyószáma alatt.<br/>Louise hercegnő24.<br/>Sophia Frederica Mecklenburg-Schwerin<br/>–<br/>Sophia Frederica, Me252627 anyai ágról28.<br/>Albert Azzo, Milánó őrgrófja<br/>–<br/>Alberto Azzo II, Milánó őrgrófja és Liguria, Gavello és Padua grófja, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice és Montagnana, azaz II.

Hugh-t grófnak nyilvánították, de nem tudott felülkerekedni Róberttel, Normandia hercegével szemben a IV. Henrik, német-római császár és VII. Gergely pápa közötti Investiture Controversy-ban, Azzo megkísérelt közvetíteni, de később a pápa oldalára állt. 1073 körül Estén kastélyt készített rezidenciájára, melyből az Este-ház, még az építkezése előtt, Este alig volt több, mint egy falu. Fia, Welf előbb Karintiába, majd Bajorországba költözött, így született meg az európai történelem egyik legjelentősebb családja, egy másik fia, I. Fulk milánói herceg, aki elsőként használta fel a dEste márki címet. II. Azzó feleségül vette Kunigundét, II.

Második házassága Garsendével, I. Herbert, Maine grófjának lányával volt és a következő ismert fiaik születtek, I. Fulco milánói őrgrófnak, az Este Hugh V.-ház itáliai ágának ősének, Maine grófjának nem volt gondja. Egyes források szerint feleségül vette Vitalia Orseolót, Orseolo Péter lányát is és házasságon kívüli viszonyt folytatott Matildával, Vilmos páduai püspök húgával, akivel egy Adelasia nevű lánya született, aki Guglielmo Adelardihoz ment feleségül.

Ottó bajor herceg lányát, Ethelindét, amikor apósa, Otto herceg IV. Henrik király ellenségévé vált, és elvesztette hercegségét, Welf hűséges maradt a királyhoz. Henrik parancsainak eleget téve megtagadta és elvált hercegnéjétől, Ethelindétől és erre az eseményre 1070-ben Goslarnál került sor, amikor a bajor államok csendesen behódoltak az újonnan készült hercegnek, aki a tartomány egyik legősibb családjának képviselője volt. A hercegné elutasítása, ami igazságtalanságnak tekinthető. A pápa és a császár 1076-ban felületesen megbékéltek, de az év ismét aktív ellenségeskedést látott. Henrik az ismétlődő lázadások következményeként Welfet megfosztotta trónjától újonnan megszerzett hercegségében. Azonban a hűséges bajorok támogatásával és apja segítségével Welf meg tudta tartani helyét Itáliában, azonban Gergely 1085-ben meghalt, és utódai kevésbé intenzív részt vettek a német ügyekben. Welf, bár még mindig ragaszkodott az egyház pártjához, a válás után, 1070-ben, első feleségétől, Welf feleségül vette Flandriai Judithot, IV. Baldwin, Flandria grófjának lányát, és Tostig Godwinson, Northumbria grófjának özvegyét. Welf fia, Welf 1089-ben feleségül vette Toszkánai Matildát, így erősítve a kapcsolatot a pápával, azonban miután az ifjabb Welf 1095-ben elvált Matildától, Welf kibékült IV. Henrik királlyal, és Bajorország hercegi pozíciójában újra megerősítették. Apja, Azzo 1097-es halála után Welf megpróbálta megszerezni apja tulajdonát az Alpoktól délre, 1099-ben Welf csatlakozott az 1101-es keresztes hadjárathoz, az aquitániai IX. Vilmossal, a vermandois-i Hugh-val és az osztrák Ida-val együtt. Fő sikere az volt, hogy megakadályozta a bizánci területeket Konstantinápoly felé fosztogató keresztesek összecsapását, Welf maga is megmenekült a fiaskótól, de 1101-ben a ciprusi Paphosban visszaúton meghalt, és a Weingarten apátságban temették el.

Fiatalkorában az Alpoktól délre eső Este-birtokokat igazgatta, Wulfhildével, Magnus szász herceg lányával kötött házassága révén 1095 körül megszerezte a Lüneburg környéki Billung-birtokok egy részét. Arra törekedett, hogy apósát szász hercegként kövesse, amikor Magnus 1106-ban örökösök nélkül halt meg. Henrik herceg ennek ellenére fenntartotta szoros kapcsolatait az uralkodó Salian-dinasztiával, 1116-ban csatlakozott V. Henrik császár második itáliai hadjáratához, hogy megragadja a néhai Toszkánai Margit Matilda birtokait. Bátyját, II. Welf bajor herceget követte, amikor az 1120-ban gyermektelenül meghalt, Henrik is hozzájárult az 1122-es Worms-i konkordátumhoz, véget vetve a pápa és a császár közötti hosszú távú vitának. A házasságot 1127 májusában kötötték meg, a Welf és Hohenstaufen dinasztiák közötti elhidegülés a 13. századig tartott. Miután Lothair megnyerte a választást, birodalmi tilalmat vezetett be II. Frigyes ellen. Henrik nem sokkal később meghalt, és Weingartenben temették el, és felesége, Wulfhilde mindössze 16 nappal élte túl.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Kövessen minket<br/><br/>AN VAGY<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Sóvárgó cukor? Itt van, amit a tested próbál mondani<br/><br/>által<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTÓ:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Súlygyarapodás out-of-control sóvárgást félretéve, lehet frusztráló, hogy egy állandó sóvárgást valami egészségtelen, és nem tudom, miért. A jó hír az, hogy általában oka van annak, hogy az égő vágy, hogy egy zacskó burgonya chipset tároljon, vagy az az érzés, hogy valóban meghalhat, ha nem kap egy savanyúságot ez azonnal (még akkor is, ha nem vagy terhes). Ha például a Tejút-rudakról látomásai vannak, ez azt jelentheti, hogy hiányzik egy nagyon specifikus tápanyag az étrendben. (Igen - ez bonyolultabb, mint a csokoládé, amely annyira átkozottul finom.)<br/><br/>Beszéltünk Los Angeles-i székhelyű dietetikus Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., hogy a sovány néhány közös élelmiszer utáni sóvárgás, valamint mit tehetünk, hogy jóllakott az éhség anélkül, hogy túlzásba. Folytassa a görgetést néhány komolyan jó információért!<br/><br/>Ha csokoládéra vágysz<br/><br/>Ez azt jelenti: Lehet, hogy hiányzik a magnézium az étrendben, mondja Lenchewski. "A magnézium alapvető ásványi anyag, amely részt vesz az energiatermelésben, a glükóz anyagcserében és az izomműködésben. Ez különösen igaz azok számára, akik keményen ütik az edzőtermet" - magyarázza. Ezenkívül a menstruáció előtti hetekben a magnéziumszint alacsonyabb, ami megmagyarázza, hogy a PMS miért jár olyan gyakran a csokoládé utáni sóvárgással.<br/><br/>Ehelyett érje el a kiváló minőségű, alacsony cukortartalmú sötét csokoládét, amely természetesen magas magnéziumtartalmú. "Azt javaslom, hogy ragaszkodjon a 75 százalékos kakaóhoz vagy annál magasabbra, és párosítsa egy másik magnéziumban gazdag forrással, mint a napraforgómag" - mondja Lenchewski. Azt javasolja, hogy a csokoládé márka Hu, egy kis tételű élelmiszeripari cég, amely a helyben előállított kiváló minőségű összetevőkre összpontosít. "Ez egy kicsit drága, de annál több ok arra, hogy az adagokat ellenőrizze" - mondja. "Ez az én személyes kedvencem." Mi is nagy rajongói vagyunk a szuperfood-csomagolt Zenbunni-nak.<br/><br/>Ha cukorkára vágysz<br/><br/>Ez azt jelenti: "A tiszta cukor készítése jó jelzés arra, hogy kevés energiát fogyaszt" - mondja Lenchewski. - Gondoljon bele. Mi az az egy dolog, amit egy szörnyű éjszakai alvás után vagy délután 4 óra körül egy stresszes munkanapon? A válasz általában a cukor, mert a testünk sejtjeinek azonnali üzemanyagaként használják.<br/><br/>Ehelyett nyúljon az almához dióvajjal. "Ha a munkatársai cukorka-készletét fosztogatja, lassúbb szénhidrátot ajánlok zsír- vagy fehérjeforrással" - mondja Lenchewski. Az egyszerű cukorral ellentétben ez táplálja a sejteket, miközben elkerüli a cukor utáni összeomlást. Két lehetőség, hogy a nagy pick-me-up a következő alkalommal, amikor a cukorka: egy szeletelt alma a választott dió vaj, vagy bogyók 2% édesítetlen görög joghurt. Szeretjük az édesszájúakat ezekkel az addiktív kókusz chipsekkel is - töltelékkel, hozzáadott cukor nélkül, és csak annyira jó.<br/><br/>Ha sóra vágysz<br/><br/>Ez azt jelenti: "Ha a legsósabb savanyúságon kívül semmi más nem fog működni, akkor lehet, hogy nem iszol elég H2O-t" - mondja Lenchewski. - A só segít a testnek a víz megtartásában, ezért vágyunk rá, amikor folyadékra van szükségünk.<br/><br/>Ehelyett elérje a vizet. "Maradj hidratált, különösen a nyári hónapok közeledtével" - mondja. A következő alkalommal, amikor a sóvárgás eléri, próbálja meg (szó szerint) néhány frissítő pohárral kioltani, és előfordulhat, hogy a nátrium-binge sürgőssége eltűnik. "Ha a sima víz untat, próbálja meg hozzáadni a mentát, a citromot vagy a fagyasztott gyümölcsöt, hogy keverje össze" - mondja Lenchewski. És ha ez még mindig nem teszi meg a trükköt, van egy egészségesebb alternatíva a csomagolt chips vagy sült krumpli. "Ha tényleg csak sóra vágysz, a pirított hínár egy nagyszerű alacsony kalóriatartalmú lehetőség" - mondja.<br/><br/>Ha keményítőtartalmú szénhidrátra vágysz, mint a tészta<br/><br/>Ez azt jelenti: "Mivel a magas szénhidráttartalmú ételek növelik a szerotonin jó érzést keltő hormont, a keményítő utáni sóvárgás jele lehet annak, hogy hangulatjavítóra van szüksége" - mondja Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Ehelyett nyúljon egy fürdőhöz! "Bust ki az Epsom sókat, mert itt az ideje egy komoly R + R-nek" - mondja Lenchewski. "Bízz bennem. A keményítőben való elkényeztetése nagyon jó érzés a pillanatban, de valószínűleg a következő napon jobban ki fog merülni." (Mint bárki, aki valaha is túlságosan elkényezteti a pizzát vagy a tésztát, tudja.) Tehát a következő alkalommal, amikor először fejet szeretne merülni egy tál szénhidrátba, vegyen egy fürdőt, gyújtson gyertyát, és bánja meg magát minden sajnálkozás vagy sűrű kalória nélkül.<br/><br/>Ha jégkrémre vágysz<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Ez azt jelenti: "A tested azt mondja, hogy szüksége van néhány egészséges zsírra."<br/><br/>Ehelyett nyúljon kókuszos fagylaltért. - Realista vagyok, tehát ha fagylaltra vágyik, nem fogok ajánlani egy marék diót, amelyek természetesen tele vannak egészséges zsírral - mondja Lenchewski. "Fagylalt vészhelyzet esetén alacsonyabb cukortartalmú kókuszos fagylaltokat ajánlok, mint a Coconut Bliss vagy Kippy háromkomponensű fagylaltja Los Angelesben." Garantálhatjuk, hogy a kókuszos fagylaltnak hihetetlen íze van, és csak olyan, mint az igazi.<br/><br/>Ha hamburgerre vágysz<br/><br/>Azt jelenti: vasra van szükséged. "Ha nem tudod abbahagyni a vörös húsra való gondolkodást, akkor van esély arra, hogy a tested vasra, b12-re és folsavra vágyik" - mondja Lenchewski. "Ez különösen igaz a hónap ezen időszakában vagy környékén."<br/><br/>Ehelyett nyúljon egy egészségesebb burgerért. "Hetente egyszer vagyok a fű táplált, antibiotikum és hormonmentes vörös hús támogatója" - mondja Lenchewski. "Próbáljon kísérletezni egy nyitott arcú bölényburgerrel - amely vágásra vágva karcsúbb és több vas van, mint a marhahús." Ne egyél húst? Próbálj meg valamilyen növényi alapú vas-kiegészítőt beépíteni a rutinodba, mint például a spirulina. |

Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Webes szolgáltatások, értékesítők és kibertörvények!<br/><br/>Frissítve:április 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Ennek a világnak a számítógépesítése nagymértékben megváltoztatta az emberi teljesítményt, és ez túlmutat a mérésen. Például most már egyetlen kattintással küldhet létfontosságú információkat az egész világon, az internetkapcsolatnak köszönhetően. Sajnos ez a széles körű kapcsolat és népszerűség az emberek körében, az internet is növelte a számítógépes bűncselekmények esélyeit. Az internetes bűncselekményeket vagy számítógépes bűncselekményeket széles körben "kiberbűncselekményeknek" nevezik.<br/><br/>A "kibertörvények" valami új az igazságszolgáltatási rendszerben, de az utóbbi időben sok figyelmet kapott. A kiberbűnözés kifejezés valami nagyon szinonimája a hagyományos bűnözésnek, az egyetlen különbség a végrehajtás médiuma. Alapvetően kétféle számítógépes bűncselekmény létezik, az első az, amelyben a számítógépek a fő célpontok, és ezek közé tartoznak az adatkárosodások, a rosszindulatú kódok és még a bűnügyi adatokhoz való hozzáférés is. A második az, amelyben a számítógép csak egy eszköz, amellyel a hagyományos bűncselekményeket követik el például a számítógépes terrorizmus, a spam, a számítógépes zaklatás és még sok más.<br/><br/>Ez az, ahol egy weboldal tanácsadó vagy egy eladó jön a képbe. Bár nem ismeri az összes kibertörvényt, a weboldal szállítója tanácsot adhat a legfontosabb számítógépes törvényekről a webhely létrehozása során.<br/><br/>Ez magában foglalhatja a másolási jogok általános ismeretét, vagy akár a saját webhely tartalmának védelmét. A webhely tulajdonosaként szerzett összes jogának magyarázata szintén olyan feladat, amelyet a webhely-szolgáltató végezhet a webhely fejlesztése során. Az eladó is segíthet Önnek azáltal, hogy információkat nyújt a különböző számítógépes törvényekről az adatok védelme érdekében. Mindezek mellett az eladó is kínál információkat minden olyan új számítógépes törvényről, amelyet esetleg nem tud, amíg nem tudja. A kibertörvények országonként eltérőek lehetnek, egy közelmúltbeli példa lehet az Egyesült Királyságban kiadott cookie-törvény, amely megakadályozza, hogy a weboldal bármilyen felhasználói böngészési adatot tároljon. A cookie-törvény értelmében az Egyesült Királyságban található webhelyek nem menthetik el a cookie-fájlokat a szörfös tájékoztatása nélkül.<br/><br/>Az ilyen törvények végrehajtása után a webhelyeknek van egy előugró ablaka, amely a látogató beleegyezését kéri a cookie-fájlok mentéséhez. Az ilyen fájlokat a webhelyek arra használják, hogy elemezzék a látogatók böngészési mintáját, amely alapján a hirdetések egy felhasználói ablakban jelennek meg. A hackelés már nem új dolog mindannyiunk számára, gondolja, hogy az ilyen szabályok és szabályozások megakadályozhatják az online hamisítást vagy a számítógépes bűnözést? A technológia gyors ütemben fejlődött, de az emberek még mindig nem preferálják az online vásárlást, mert félnek a személyes vagy bankszámlaadatok feltörésétől. A kiberbűnözés növekedésével a szigorú kibertörvények iránti igény is nőtt, hogy megfékezzék ugyanezt, és elősegítsék a kockázatmentes vásárlási élményt.<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés osztályai<br/><br/>Az évek során három fő osztálya volt a kiberbűnözésnek:<br/><br/>Jogosulatlan hozzáférés a számítógépes rendszer esetekben, amely magában foglalja a hackelés vagy ellopása felhasználónevek és jelszavak, hogy hozzáférjen a személyes adatokat az adott felhasználó. Ez a fajta backdoor hozzáférés szervezett segítségével Trojan Horse. A rosszindulatú programok, például a trójai ház, a férgek vagy a számítógépes vírusok felszabadítása stb. Az utolsó osztály magában foglalja a felhasználó számítógépes zaklatását vagy online zaklatását.<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés közvetlen következményei<br/><br/>Az eladások csökkenése<br/><br/>A személyzet teljesítményének csökkenése a hálózati késések miatt<br/><br/>Személyre szabott információk elvesztése, mint például a kutatómunka<br/><br/>Kommunikációs zavarok<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés közvetett következményei<br/><br/>Hitelességi problémák a pénzügyi rendszerben<br/><br/>A márka imázsa elhomályosult a piacon<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés hatással van az üzleti kapcsolatokra a piacon<br/><br/>Az állami politikába és a kormányzati szervekbe vetett bizalom elveszett<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés megelőzése<br/><br/>Mint netizens vannak bizonyos óvintézkedéseket, hogy meg kell fontolnunk a biztonságos online élmény. Íme néhány közülük:<br/><br/>Az első dolog, amit meg kell tennie, az, hogy megtartsa a személyes adatait, és elkerülje ugyanazt az online megosztást.<br/><br/>Kerülje a fényképek megosztását online chat barátokkal vagy idegenekkel.<br/><br/>Telepítése legújabb verzióját anti-vírus a rendszer kínál egy jó védelmi vonal ellen internetes fenyegetések, mint a vírusok és rosszindulatú programok.<br/><br/>Az értékes adatok biztonsági mentése jó lehetőség arra, hogy elkerülje a vírusfertőzéshez hasonló problémákat.<br/><br/>Kerülje el a hitelkártya-információk küldését olyan webhelyekre, amelyek nem biztonságosak és nem rendelkeznek érvényes tanúsítvánnyal.<br/><br/>Biztonsági program telepítése, amely lehetővé teszi a webhely cookie-jainak ellenőrzését, és megmenti Önt a webhelyek nyomon követésétől.<br/><br/>A host-alapú behatolásérzékelő eszközök szervereken történő elhelyezése segít nyomon követni a webhely forgalmának szabálytalanságait.<br/><br/>Javasolt a tűzfal használata.<br/><br/>Miért olyan népszerűek a kibertámadások?<br/><br/>Olcsóbb, mint a hagyományos csalási módszerek<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés nyomon követése nem egyszerű<br/><br/>A pontos helyszíneket nem lehet könnyen nyomon követni<br/><br/>Fizikai akadályok hiánya az internet világában<br/><br/>A kiberbűnözés sok embert érint<br/><br/>Következtetés<br/><br/>Az a tény, hogy az emberi elme felfoghatatlan hatalommal rendelkezik, tagadhatatlan, ezért az internetes bűncselekmények óriási mértékben növekednek. Még a történelem is tanúja volt a legnagyobb internetes biztonságnak, amelyet a hackerek keze ment el, akik könnyen megúszták. Az egyetlen módja annak, hogy megfékezze az ilyen bűncselekményeket, hogy tisztában legyen a mai számítógépes törvényekkel, amelyek akár az interneten, akár a webhelyen / informatikai gyártókon keresztül történhetnek. Az informatikai törvénynek olyan módon kell kiegyensúlyozottnak lennie, hogy túl szigorúnak bizonyuljon a számítógépes bűncselekményekben részt vevő emberek számára, és ugyanakkor soha ne akadályozza az internetes ipar növekedését.<br/><br/>Author Bio: - Maneet Puri jelenleg vezető minőségi web design cég található New Delhi, India.
