| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>2015. nov. 19.<br/>Írta: Doxiderol<br/><br/>A Bacopa egy évelő növény, amely a mocsaras szubtrópusi és trópusi régiókban virágzik szerte a világon. A nagyra becsült gyógynövény a Doxiderol kulcsfontosságú összetevője, egy táplálékkiegészítő, amely fokozza a kognitív funkciót. Bacopát azért választották, mert képes megvédeni az agyat és növelni az acetilkolint, egy biokémiai hírvivőt, amely lehetővé teszi az idegrendszer számára az információ továbbítását.<br/><br/>Az ayurvédikus szakemberek először 300-ban írták le a bacopa terápiás tulajdonságait. Az orvosok rögzítették a bacopa képességeit az intelligencia és a memória fokozására. Közel 2500 évvel később a modern kutatások egyre növekvő köre megerősíti a bacopa kognitív előnyeit az ayurvédikus szövegben.<br/><br/>1987-ben indiai kutatók értékelték a bacopa hatását az iskoláskorú gyermekek értelmi működésére. A négyhetes vizsgálat során 40 6 és 8 év közötti gyermeknek adtak bacopát. A tudósok megállapították, hogy a bacopa növelte az érzékelést és a memóriát. A gyerekek gyorsabban és pontosabban tudták megoldani a labirintus gyakorlatokat a bacopa bevétele után. Sok szülő Indiában rutinszerűen használja a bacopát, hogy fokozza gyermekeik szellemi fejlődését.<br/><br/>A Psychopharmacology 2001 augusztusi számában megjelent 12 hetes tanulmány a bacopa kognitív funkciókra gyakorolt hatását vizsgálta. A tudósok véletlenszerűen osztották be az egészséges önkénteseket, 18 és 65 év közöttieket, hogy bacopát vagy inaktív anyagot kapjanak. A tanulmányhoz kettős vak konfigurációt is használtak, hogy elrejtsék a termékek identitását. A kutatók ezt a kialakítást használják annak biztosítására, hogy a vizsgálati eredmények érvényesek legyenek, mert kiküszöböli a kutatók és a résztvevők elfogultságát. A bacopa csoport jelentős javulást tapasztalt a vizuális információk feldolgozásának sebességében. A résztvevők gyorsabban tanultak és hatékonyabban tárolták az új emlékeket.<br/><br/>2007-ben egy Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratóriumi vizsgálat feltárta az egyik mechanizmust, amely felelős a bacopa agyi egészséget elősegítő képességéért. A tudósok szerint a bacopa polifenolokat használ az oxidatív stressz és az egészséges agysejtek károsodásának megelőzésére. A Bacopa csökkenti a béta-amiloid néven ismert anyag káros lerakódásait is, amely az Alzheimer-kórban szenvedő betegek agyában a plakk elsődleges összetevője.<br/><br/>A Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2008. júliusi számában megjelent kettős vak tanulmány értékelte a bacopa hatását az idős betegekre. A tanulmány megerősítette, hogy a bacopa növelte a kognitív teljesítményt, miközben csökkentette a stresszt. A szerzők szerint a tanulmányban elért előnyök megerősítették a korábbi kutatások eredményeit.<br/><br/>A Fitoterápiás Kutatás 2008 decemberi számában megjelent 90 napos tanulmány megerősíti azokat a kognitív előnyöket, amelyeket korábban más bakopa tanulmányok mutattak ki. A Bacopa jelentősen javította a résztvevők azon képességét, hogy ideiglenesen tárolják és felhasználják a komplex feladat elvégzéséhez szükséges információkat. A kettős vak vizsgálat azt is kimutatta, hogy a bacopa csökkentette a vizuális információk feldolgozásához szükséges időt.<br/><br/>Amellett, hogy fokozza az idegi jelátvitelt, a tudósok feltételezik, hogy a bacopa növeli a kognitív funkciót a szorongás csökkentésével. Számos tanulmány azt mutatja, hogy a szorongás zavarja a magasabb szintű kognitív funkciókat igénylő feladatok elvégzésének képességét, mint például a tanulás és a memorizálás. A stressz megzavarja a biokémiai hírvivőket és az egészséges idegi jelátvitelt. A Bacopa enyhíti a stresszt és helyreállítja a nyugalmat az acetilkolin szintjének növelésével, ami csökkenti a pulzusszámot, és lehetővé teszi, hogy mélyebb lélegzetet vegyen.<br/><br/>Doxiderol egy nagyszerű módja annak, hogy az előnyeit bacopa. Ez a holisztikus kiegészítés is tartalmaz más természetes összetevőket, amelyek elősegítik az agy egészségét, és támogatja a képességét, hogy összpontosítson, és koncentráljon a komplex feladat, valamint memorizálni információkat. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Érzékelheti a démoni aurákat és a gonosz aurákat is. Amikor azonban megszületett és nőtt, az ereje megpecsételődött, és sokkal kevésbé volt hatalmas. Amióta Kagome legyőzte azt, aki megpecsételte az erejét, elérte a teljes potenciálját.<br/><br/>A fizikai kapcsolat kialakításával Kagome képes megtisztítani mind a mérget, mind a sötétséget az alanytól (élő és élettelen). Ehhez a kezén keresztül vetíti ki spirituális erőit.<br/><br/>Teljes potenciáljával Kagome képes arra, hogy akadályt hozzon létre maga körül, és kibővítse mások körül. Ez egy kupola alakú akadály, amely elpusztíthatja a gyenge démonokat, amelyek kapcsolatba lépnek a gáttal.<br/><br/>JAVÍTOTT SZEMÉLY<br/>Kagome képes olyan dolgokat látni, amelyek gyakran láthatatlanok az emberi szem számára: szellemek, szellemek, isteni és gonosz aura.<br/><br/>A FEGYVEREKKEL VALÓ FELHASZNÁLÁS<br/>Kagome rendelkezik azzal a képességgel, hogy íjat és nyilat használjon. Önképzésben részesült, és évek gyakorlata után a nyila ritkán hagyja el a jelet. Emellett Kagome képes arra, hogy a nyilakat erővel töltse be. Képes átjárni egy nyilat a spirituális erejével, amely lehetővé teszi számukra, hogy behatoljanak a démoni erőkbe, elpusztítsák a varázslatokat és megtisztítsák a tárgyakat. Képes átjárni az íját az erejével és eltéríteni az ellenséges támadásokat. Képes arra, hogy nyilait tisztító energiával töltse fel, hogy megtisztítsa a mérget, valamint erős, távoli démoni támadásokat. És végül, megvan az a képessége, hogy megkerüljön másokat a nyilával: Ha a célpontja egy akadály vagy túsz mögött van, a nyíl teleportálhat és csak a célpontját találja el.<br/><br/>A többi képessége meglehetősen lényegtelenné vált, mivel az időutazáshoz (a Csontevő Kútján keresztül), a Shikon Ékkőhöz, vagy előző inkarnációjához kapcsolódnak.<br/><br/>a kánon<br/><br/>Kagome-ot néhány nappal a középiskolai diploma megszerzése után húzták meg, de mielőtt a Csontevő kút újra megnyílt volna, hogy lehetővé tegye számára, hogy véglegesen visszatérjen a múltba.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>Emlékek<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>Nevének hangja lágy suttogás volt az elméje hátsó részében, mint egy hívás, amelyet a szél elfojtott. Egy távoli emlék hangja volt, egy hang, amelyet elkezdett elfelejteni, de kétségbeesetten ragaszkodott mindahhoz. Az anyja hangja volt, elveszett lánya bánatában. Végül Kagome nyom nélkül száműzte. Élénken emlékezett azokra a pillanatokra, a nap kezdetére, a reggelire és az utolsó dologra, amit az anyjának mondott. Ez kísérteties volt, ezek az emlékek, mert olyan volt, mint bármely más alkalom, amikor világok között csúszott. Felébredt, kedvetlenül, mert nem volt célja az iskolán kívül. Talált munkát, és aznap interjúra volt bejegyezve. A szíve nem volt benne, de ezt kellett tennie.<br/><br/>Eszébe jutott a rettegés érzése, felszívta, és lelkesítő beszédet tartott magának, hogy ezt megteheti. Hogy előrehaladhat az életben, amit most kellett volna tennie, hogy a dolgok a múltban rendeződtek. Persze, az az érzése volt, hogy már nem tartozik a saját idejébe, sem az életébe.<br/><br/>Kagome emlékezett a fa érzésére az ujjai alatt, ahogy a keze a fogantyúba görbült, hogy kinyissa az ajtót. Emlékezett arra, hogy megállt, és fényes és élénk mosollyal fordult az anyjához, ahogy rázta magát a kábulatából. "Elmegyek." Eszébe jutott, hogy milyen erős hangja, a mosoly az anyja ajkán, ahogy a szeme ragyogott a büszkeségtől. Az anyja búcsút vett tőle, ami nem tűnt másnak, mint korábban, de valahogy a szavak súlya Kagome vállára nehezedett, minél jobban tükröződött.<br/><br/>Röviden, a gondolatok villogtak előre, azon tűnődve, hogy az anyja aggódott-e érte, mint ő. Kagome nyíltan bevallhatta, hogy anyja ereje, támogatása abban a tényben, hogy lánya olyan gyakran csúszott át az időn. Volt idő, amikor gyengének érezte magát, amiért nem volt képes a nőre támaszkodni.<br/><br/>Emlékezett azonban arra, hogy szegényes mennyiségű erőt gyűjtött össze. Emlékezett a levegő változására, a hőmérsékletre, amely jelentősen eltért a vártól, és villogott a hirtelen és ismeretlen környezetben. Nem a családja szentélye volt, és amikor visszafordult, hogy beosonjon az ajtón, ismeretlen és hideg fémmel találkozott az ujjai alatt, és egy belső térrel, amely nem volt a ház bejárata. Egy férfi állt előtte, egy pult mögött, aki olyan széles szemekkel bámult rá, mint a sajátja.<br/><br/>Legalább nem esett pánikba, mert átsiklott az időn, és lehetetlen helyzetekbe került, így legalább az akaraterőd megerősödött. Mert nem minden nap történt, hogy valaki a múltba rántotta magát egy démonnal, azzal a szándékkal, hogy kitépjen egy hatalmas ékszert a testéből, amiről nem is tudták, hogy ott van. És akkor ott volt az a tény, hogy ő összetört mondta erőteljes ékszer, aki tudja, hogy hány darab, és feladata megtalálni őket. Az ilyen dolgok nem voltak normálisak, és ő volt szükség, hogy négyzet és roll vele egyszer rájött, hogy ez az ő valósága. Olyan egyszerűnek tűnt, csak összeszedni a szilánkokat és megjavítani az ékszert.<br/><br/>De nem volt könnyű, sok démon volt a szilánkok és maga az ékszer után, és egy különösen erős démon azzal a kívánsággal, hogy eltökélte, hogy teljesítse. A mai napig nem tanulta meg a kívánságát, de tudta, hogy soha nem teljesült, még akkor sem, ha az átkozott dolog befejeződött. Olyan sok életet tett tönkre a semmiért. Olyan sok életet tett tönkre egy ilyen hiábavaló feladatért. Naraku volt a legnehezebb ellenség, és az egyetlen, aki a középpontjában volt mindennek, ami rosszul ment a barátja életében.<br/><br/>De ez a kiszámíthatatlanság, az a szükségszerűség volt, hogy azzal foglalkozzon, ami történik, és az akaraterő, amit a kalandja során szerzett, amire emlékezett, hogy egy olyan történetet hozott létre, amely illeszkedik a pillanatba, ami nem tűnt túl szeszélyesnek vagy túl messzire. Hinnie kellett benne, hogy életben maradhasson.<br/><br/>Végül is rosszabbul nézett ki, mint egy férfi a kameraboltban. Hazudott a foga között, hogy megmentse az életét.<br/><br/>"Munkát kerestem." Végül is nem volt teljes hazugság. Végül is elhagyta a házát azzal a szándékkal, hogy részt vegyen egy állásinterjún. A ruhája legalább ezt tanúsítja. Ez volt az egyik könnyebb füllentés, amit valaha is mondott.<br/><br/>És valamilyen oknál fogva az az őrült férfi bérelte fel.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>Kagomed felborult az ágyában, miközben visszanyomta a távoli emlékeket, és nem volt hajlandó elismerni, hogy valóban ébren van. Az alvás utolsó pillanataiban karmolt, könyörögve, hogy térjen vissza, és vegye vissza az ölelésébe. Behunyta a szemét, hajlandó aludni, hogy jöjjön, és csak találkozott az emlékek. A visszhangok egy dal énekelt a távolban az emlékeit, egy dal, amely gyakran kínozta őt, mivel ugyanazt a nevet kapta, mint ő. Az éneklő hang már nem az anyjára emlékeztetett, hanem a gyerekek hangjára, akikkel felnőttként gyakran együtt játszott. Visszahívták az emlékeket, pedig évek teltek el azóta, hogy ezt élőben elkezdte, pedig boldog volt ebben az életben, ezeknek az emlékeknek a hívása túl hangos volt.<br/><br/>Hirtelen visszaesett beléjük, és az alvás ismét elkerülte őt. Figyelte magát a családja ölelésében, miközben Inuyasha visszahúzódott a kútba, és annyira megdöbbent, mint érezte magát. Annak a pillanatnak az emlékei, azok az érzések, még mindig olyan erősek voltak. A szívfájdalom és a bánat érzése újra felemelkedett, bár olyan régen érezte magát, mintha elszakadt volna mindentől, ami fontos volt neki.<br/><br/>Természetesen fontos volt a családja, és örült, hogy újra a karjukban lehet. Még mindig nem tudta megmagyarázni, hogyan érezte magát kettétörve, háborúzó vágyakkal, hogy mind a múltjában, mind a jelenében legyen. Emlékezett a hiábavaló kísérletekre, hogy átugorjon a kúton, ujjait a földre szorítva, kétségbeesetten könyörögve, hogy engedje vissza. Az első hónapban otthon nem aludt annyit, mint amennyit sírt.<br/><br/>Elysion hasonló reakciót váltott ki, bár nem volt olyan heves, mert nem tudta pontosan, hol csúszott át, és azt sem tudta, hol férkőzhet vissza. Felfedezései finomak voltak a munkája és az életébe való beilleszkedés között. Nem szándékozott maradni, nem szándékozott tovább maradni, mint amennyire szüksége volt. És bár nem próbálkozott olyan hevesen, mint amikor megpróbált visszatérni a múltba, a szenvedélye tízszeres volt, mert nem kötődött ehhez a világhoz.<br/><br/>Az irracionális pillanataiban azt hitte, hogy az Ékkő visszahúzta őt, és új poklot talált neki. Egy új pokol, amely arra kényszeríti őt, hogy kívánjon, de nagyon világosan emlékezett arra, hogy azt kívánta, hogy örökre eltűnjön. Ez nem állította meg az álmait, azokat az időket, amikor zokogva ébredt fel az éjszakában, és azokat az emlékeket a múltjából a legnehezebb feldolgozni, a legnehezebb elfelejteni. A szíve pánikba esett, amikor újra megfordult az ágyában, a lélegzete küzdelemmé vált, amikor harcolt a pánikroham ellen, amelyet a vándorló elméje okozott ilyen késő este.<br/><br/>Gyűlölte a gyengeséget, a félelmet.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>Kagome végül kihúzta magát az ágyból, szobája halvány fénnyel világított, ami elég volt ahhoz, hogy a fürdőszobába vezesse. A tükör előtt állt, a mosogató fut, miközben a tükörképét bámulta. Hollószínű haja eltakarta az arcát, és olyan rosszul érezte magát, mint amilyennek látszott. Első reggele az Elysionban hasonló volt ehhez, csak rosszabb állapotban volt.<br/><br/>Talált egy helyet, ahol aludhat, és sikerült megállapodnia az épület tulajdonosával, hogy lehetővé tegye számára, hogy fizetés nélkül maradjon egy kis ideig. Talán Miroku befolyása volt az, ami lehetővé tette számára, hogy ilyen üzleteket kössön, mivel a szerzetes ismert volt a bájos (vagy csaló) emberekről, hogy többet adjon nekik, mint elég a munkájukhoz. A szerzetes mindig is ilyen volt, amióta először találkoztak. Azt állítja, hogy egy úr lakását kísértetjárta, amikor nem volt, vagy azt állítja, hogy támadásnak voltak kitéve, amikor nem voltak. Ilyen magas áron eladja a gyámságait és a bájait. Gyakorlatilag minden alkalommal működött, és azon tűnődött, hogy az emberek miért voltak annyira hajlandóak megbízni benne.<br/><br/>Talán a mosolya, vagy az a tény, hogy szerzetes volt, hogy a múlt emberei annyira hajlandóak voltak összeomlani. Mindig azt tette, ami helyes, és az erő szimbóluma volt számára azokban az időkben, amikor mindent megtett, hogy azt tegye, ami helyes. Végignyomta azt a tényt, hogy haldoklik, hogy el van átkozva, és megpróbált tenni valamit, ahelyett, hogy fetrengene a sorsában. A végső harcukhoz vezető időben a határig tolta magát. És ő örült, hogy legyőzték Naraku-t, mielőtt ugyanolyan sorsra juthatott volna, mint az apja, és az apja előtte.<br/><br/>Ami azonban a saját varázsát illeti, tisztességesebb volt, mint a barátja, és ésszerűvé tette az üzletet. Kételkedett abban, hogy bárki ezen a világon súlyos árat fizetne az ördögűzésért vagy a démonok elűzéséért. Túl technológiailag fejlettek voltak ehhez. De elég okos volt, és elég okos, hogy jó üzletet kössön.<br/><br/>De most, Kagome jobb helyen volt, bár az arca ugyanúgy nézett ki.<br/><br/>Egy gyors pillantás a falon lévő órára azt mondta neki, hogy megpróbálhat tovább aludni. De úgy döntött, hogy nem akar újra szembenézni a flashbackekkel. Ehelyett zuhanyozott, a hideg vizet használta, hogy elkergesse a démonait, hogy megtöltse a tüdejét egy éles lélegzettel, és ébren tartsa magát.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>Nem vált be.<br/><br/>Nem úgy, ahogy ő akart. A hideg víz minden bizonnyal kényszerítette a levegőt a tüdejébe, arra kényszerítette az elméjét, hogy felébredjen, és az izmokat megragadja. Keserű nevetést kapott az ajkáról, amikor hátrahajtotta a fejét, és többet emlékezett. Ma nem menekült volna meg tőlük olyan könnyen, nem gyógyult volna meg olyan egyszerűen, csak azért, mert akarta.<br/><br/>Néha nem kerülheted el azokat a gondolatokat, amikre vágytál, még akkor sem, ha biztos voltál benne, hogy túl vagy rajtuk.<br/><br/>Sango nagy segítség lett volna ebben a helyzetben. A démonölő a legjobb barátja volt, még olyan messzire is ment, hogy soha nem volt nővére. Egy idősebb testvér, aki bölcs volt, mindig az ő oldalán állt, amikor baj merült fel. Különösen fiú baj, amikor az ilyen dolgok meglehetősen triviális, de szórakoztató volt, hogy a szerelem és a barátja, hogy dühös az ő nevében, amikor Inuyasha tette szomorú. Hiszen sokszor előfordult, hogy a féldémon a halott szeretője oldalára szaladt, és nem egyszer összetörte a szívét.<br/><br/>De Sango más módon is inspirálta őt. Mindazok után, amivel a nő szembesült, mindig olyan erős volt, olyan biztos... még azokban az időkben is, amikor kételkedett magában, mindig átvészelte. Csodálta, hogy képes volt túlélni, miután elvesztette az egész családját - ennek az emlékeztetője gyakran arra késztette Kagome-t, hogy túlélje, mert mindenkit elveszített ezen a világon -, majd a testvére Naraku zálogává vált. Nem volt könnyű, nem lehetett semmi, amivel bárki szembenézhetett, és még mindig előrehaladt. Még mindig mosolygott, még azzal a fájdalommal és azokkal az emlékeztetőkkel is... Gyakran olyan fényes volt, még a sötétebb időkben is.<br/><br/>És most az idősebb nő oldalára akart támaszkodni, hogy megnyugtassa a tényt, hogy ott volt, és támogatta. Úgy érezte, hogy Sango valahogy átvészeli ezt, és felajánlja az erő és a megértés szavait. Az ilyen idők tették még rosszabbá ezeket a varázslatokat, az állandó emlékeztetőt, hogy a családja nélkül van.<br/><br/>"Nem akarok egyedül lenni." Sírt hangosan a magány, a hang a zuhany fuldokló ki a könyörgést.<br/><br/>Nem félt beismerni.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>Még egy óra telt el, mielőtt észrevette volna. A bőre hideg volt a víztől, és úgy érezte, mintha jég futott volna az ereiben. Nem vette észre, hogy remegni kezdett, amíg a keze el nem nyúlt, hogy kikapcsolja a vizet és véget vessen a zuhanynak. Kagome nem kereste újra a saját tekintetét a tükörben, ehelyett törölközőbe burkolózott, és kivándorolt a fürdőszobából, fel a lépcsőn és a konyhájába. Elkezdett könnyű reggelit készíteni, tétlenül olvasta át a napi jegyzeteit, miközben az étel főtt.<br/><br/>Karrierje valóban elindult az elmúlt években. Fotói számos galériában szerepeltek, neve sok ajkat kezdett el gyakorivá tenni azok számára, akik érdeklődtek a fotózás iránt.<br/><br/>A munka, amit egy szeszélyből kért, mindent elindított. Sokkal szerencsésebb volt, mint amire számított ezen a világon. Soha nem volt olyan szerencsés, hogy visszacsússzon a repedéseken keresztül a saját világába, de elég szerencsés ahhoz, hogy jól teljesítsen. Ahogy visszafordult a kályhához, eszébe jutott az az idő, amelyet végül lemondott a hazatérésről. Körülbelül két év telt el az itteni életéből, mivel a fotózásba kezdett, mint több, mint egy hobbi, de valami, amivel nevet szerezhet magának.<br/><br/>Az a nap különösen kellemes volt, a nap magasan volt az égen, és azon kapta magát, hogy néhány fotót készít a természeti tájról. Egy kisfiú elrejtőzött az egyik növényben, és a lány képet kapott arról a pillanatról, amikor az arca vidám, huncut vigyorba borult, mielőtt kiugrott volna, hogy megijessze zsákmányát. Ez emlékeztette őt Shippou-ra, a kis kitsune-ra, amelyet lényegében örökbe fogadott. Ő is elszakadt a családjától, amikor először találkoztak. Az apja megölte, és elhatározta, hogy megbosszulja őt. Amikor fiatal volt, olyan érettnek tűnt az első találkozásaik során.<br/><br/>Talán Inuyasha befolyása tette lehetővé, hogy a készlet újra gyerekként viselkedjen, hogy fiatal és szeszélyes legyen, míg mások érettebbek voltak. A maga módján nyújtott neki vigaszt, és úgy próbált gondoskodni róla, mint a sajátjáról, bár akkor is olyan fiatal volt. Fiatalsága azonban nem akadályozta meg abban, hogy megértse, hogyan kell gondoskodni róla, vagy gondoskodni róla, mint a gyermekéről. A szíve megduzzadt, amikor mosolygott, amikor annyira örült a ceruzák ajándékának, és időt fordított a művészetre. Olyan büszke volt minden rajzra, hogy befejezte, hogy tudta, hogy egy anya így érez ilyen helyzetben.<br/><br/>A fájdalom, ami átszakította, túl sok volt, túl hirtelen. Hiányzott neki, és látni akarta, hogy mennyit nőtt, mióta elment. Annyira hiányzott...<br/><br/>Hogy megkímélje magát a további fájdalomtól, a hamis reményektől... feladta, és arra koncentrált, hogy jobbá tegye magát.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>A reggeli finom, unalmas és ihletett volt. Csak miután befejezte, rájött, hogy elfelejtette az étel bármilyen fűszerét vagy ízét. Már túl késő volt, hogy emlékezzen, hogy sok, mivel az elméje volt elfoglalva emlékezve más részleteket az életét, hogy egyértelműen vált fontosabb, mint az étel.<br/><br/>"Ülj le!"<br/><br/>Természetesen semmi sem történt, amikor dühösen kiabált egy különösen frusztráló ügyfélre, amely a féldémonra emlékeztette. Különösen makacs és durva volt, inkább egy fotót akart, nem pedig hagyta, hogy természetesen működjön. Megpróbálhatod kényszeríteni a vadállatokat, hogy úgy viselkedjenek, ahogy akarsz. De ritkán sikerült bárkinek is erővel. Inuyasha azonban nem volt olyan rossz. Inuyasha megtanulta, mielőtt kényszerítették volna tőle. Szelídebb, megértőbb, érettebb lett, bár voltak idők, amikor még gyerekes és öntelt volt.<br/><br/>Eszébe jut, hogy milyen pirosra égett az arca, de hogy állta a sarat, és rúgta ki. Azt mondta neki, hogy nem hajlandó senkinek vagy bárkinek dolgozni, aki valamit túl akar csavarni a természetén, a saját vágyain.<br/><br/>Inkább Narakuhoz kellett volna hasonlítania a férfit, mint Inuyasha-hoz. Bár az ügyfelének nem voltak ilyen szélsőséges szándékai. Legalább az érzés utána kellemes emlék volt. Az a szabadság, hogy tudja, hogy olyan messzire jutott, hogy megtagadhatja a munkát, amit nem akart csinálni, hogy a saját személye legyen, aki független a többiektől. Annak ellenére, hogy napokkal később pletykákat hallott, olyan szavakkal, amelyek rágalmazzák őt.<br/><br/>Igazságosan védte magát, ahogy utazása vége felé is tette, elvégre ő volt az egyetlen, aki meg tudta védeni magát ezen a világon.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>A reggeli fény elkezdett kúszni az otthonába, emlékeztetve őt az idő múlásával. Ismét úgy vélte, hogy a dolgok listáját meg kell tennie, és megvitatta, hogy hol kezdje. Vagy ha egyáltalán el kellene kezdenie. Azzal, hogy hogyan kezdődött a nap, nem tudta, hogy ezt nagyszerű ötletnek tekintheti-e. Kétséges volt, hogy sikeres lesz-e azzal, hogy mennyire elveszett önmagában.<br/><br/>Nem akarta elszúrni a legutóbbi munkáját, mert már néhányszor megtette, nem volt kellemes megpróbálni kiheverni egy teljes katasztrófát.<br/><br/>Kagome emlékezett arra az érzésre, hogy drága, vadonatúj fényképezőgépe kicsúszik a kezéből. Nem volt felkészülve arra, hogy támogassa, mert éppen eltávolította a táskájából. Egy része belülről kiabált. Drámai, over-the-top, tele sikoltással, amit gyakran csinált, amikor sokkal, sokkal fiatalabb volt. Amikor küzdött, hogy túlélje a középiskolát, miközben ugrált az idők között. A másik része megfagyott a helyén, miközben a lencséje teljesen összetört, és a kamera többi része is eltört vele együtt.<br/><br/>Látva Inuyasha bátyját, egy teljes démont, aki előtte állt, az utolsó dolog volt, amire számított, amikor kijutott a fotóiért. Olyan büszke volt, mint valaha, olyan magas, mint valaha, olyan lenyűgöző, mint amennyire emlékezett. Egyáltalán nem látszott, hogy teljesen más világban lenne, bár soha nem volt a legjobb a gondolatolvasásban. A neve az ajkán olyan erős volt, hogy a legapróbb érzésekre is emlékezett. Az ajkai kirepedtek, a szája száraznak érezte magát, és a gyomrában lévő szorongás bugyborékoló érzése miatt rosszul érezte magát.<br/><br/>Nem akarta, hogy a reményei teljesüljenek.<br/><br/>De azt akarta, hogy ott legyen, még akkor is, ha nem voltak barátok. Szövetségesek voltak, ha valami, mivel egymás mellett harcoltak. És valami jobb volt, mint a semmi.<br/><br/>És Kagome-nak volt annyi esze, hogy ne vesse rá magát, hogy átölelje, mert tudta, hogy nincs egyedül. A kamerája már nem számított, amikor közeledett hozzá. Emlékezett, hogy semmi más nem számít napokig, ahogy időt töltött vele, nem beszélt a világukról, hanem beszélt (vagy beszélt, és ő egyszerűen elismerte ezt a tényt).<br/><br/>Kagome nem emlékezett rá, csak egy finom dolog volt, mint ő, de tudta, hogy az érzés ott van. És tudatta vele, hogy nem volt egyedül abban, hogy elesett, hogy az érzések valahogy kivirágoztak.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>A súlytalanság érzése utolérte őt, és hirtelen kinyitotta a szemét, miközben elméje kétségbeesetten karmolta az utolsó dolgot, amit tett. Nem emlékezett rá, hogy mikor aludt el a kanapéján, de tudta, hogy az utolsó hely, ahol volt, a túlságosan kényelmes párnákon volt. Nem küzdött azonban, és nem küzdött a súlytalanság ellen, ahogy ismerős karjaiban volt. A feje nekidőlt Sesshoumaru mellkasának, megnyugvást merítve abból, hogy ő itt volt és a lány nem volt egyedül.<br/><br/>"Üdvözöljük újra." A válasza egy lágy zümmögés volt. Nem kellett sokat beszélnie, hogy megértse a szándékát, vagy a többit, amit mondania kellett.<br/><br/>Visszavitte az ágyába, könnyedén elhelyezte. A szeme találkozott az övével, és könnyedén mosolygott, mert több emlék nem sodródott vissza, több emlék nem gúnyolódott rá. Nem, amikor közel volt, soha nem esett vissza ezekbe a gondolatokba. Segített, és az évek is segítettek.<br/><br/>"Aludni." Megparancsolta könnyedén, a szeme gördült rá, de nem harcolt, mert fáradt volt. Keze szorosan kapaszkodott hozzá, míg érezte, hogy az ellenkező kéz nyomja a homlokát, hogy értékelje a jólétét.<br/><br/>"Jól vagyok," mondta, a szavai szilárdak az ígéretével.<br/><br/>Életben volt, és boldog volt.<br/><br/>A-Z<br/><br/>Feladó<br/><br/>összefoglaló<br/><br/>Kagome, valamikor az életében, egy meglehetősen átlagos tinédzser lány volt, amíg egy démon meg nem támadta a családja kútházában. A démon lehúzta őt a kútba, ami varázslatosan kb. 500 évvel a múltba vitte. Ott megtudta, hogy egy szent ékszer van a testébe zárva, mivel egy papnő reinkarnációja volt, aki 50 évvel azelőtt halt meg, hogy bevonszolták. Az ékszert letépték a testéről, és a démont, aki áthúzta az időn, legyőzte a féldémon, akit kiszabadított, akit a fához szegeztek. Kagome időben összebarátkozott a féldémonnal, Inuyasha-val, és vele utazott, hogy helyreállítsa az ékszert, amit ő maga összetört. Bár nem volt olyan egyszerű és könnyű megtenni, mint sok démon és ember kereste az ékszert saját céljaira. Összebarátkozott egy fiatal kitsune démonnal, egy szerzetessel és egy démonölővel, akik mind vele utaztak, hogy helyreállítsák az ékszert.<br/><br/>Az ő csoportja azonban nem az, aki befejezi az ékszert. Ehelyett egy gonosz féldémon, aki manipulálta a legfontosabb eseményeket a legtöbb társa életében. Amikor végül összeszedte az ékszer összes darabját, és kívánságát teljesítette a szennyezett tárgyon, Kagome magával ragadta az ékszert azzal a szándékkal, hogy önző kívánságot tegyen, hogy örökre bent tartsa, és életben tartsa az ékszert. Inuyasha makacssága volt az, ami megmentette őt a sötétségtől. Végül visszatért a természetes idejébe, befejezte a középiskolát, ahogy egy lánytól elvárták. Bár napokkal később Kagome az Elysionban kötött ki. Öt éve van ebben a világban, és már rég feladta a hazatérést. Boldogan telepedett le az új életében.<br/><br/>plátói<br/><br/>Kagome számára meglehetősen könnyű új barátokat szerezni, nem sokat változott a fiatalságától. Vidám fiatal nő, aki empatikus és barátságos a leginkább az életében. Fiatal korában összebarátkozott a démonokkal, amikor a legtöbb félne tőlük. Még a démonok is, akik embereket ettek, összebarátkoztak, és megváltoztatta az életmódjukat (szeretne gondolkodni). Ez azt jelenti, hogy nagyon könnyű a barátjává válni, amíg valaki képes megmutatni, hogy hajlandó megváltani, vagy megmutatni, hogy nem teljesen gonosz. Nagyot érez mindenki iránt, akivel találkozik, ezért nehéz számára, hogy ne vonzza mások a vágy, hogy barátok legyenek.<br/><br/>antagonista<br/><br/>Kagome haragját csak úgy lehet kiérdemelni, ha olyan siralmas, olyan gonosz, és annyira túl van a megváltáson, hogy semmi jót nem lát benned. És látja a jót nagyjából mindenkiben és mindenben. Őszintén, kivel szembesült? Egy féldémon, aki két szeretőt egymás ellen uszított, aki megátkozta az egyik barátjának a teljes férfi vonalát, és aztán a legjobb barátja bátyjával megölette a családjukat... De nyugodtan adj neki egy esélyt.<br/><br/>romantikus<br/><br/>Amikor szerelmes, Kagome erős támogatást nyújt, mindig ott marad, még akkor is, ha a dolgok kemények lehetnek. Kagome azonban nem keresi a szerelmet, nem kereste a szerelmet, amikor megérkezett, így a múltbeli kapcsolatok nem léteznek. Ez nem azt jelenti, hogy valaki nem szerelmes belé. Ő biztosan lehet valakinek a viszonzatlan szerelme, valószínűleg elfelejti. Végül Kagome jelenleg Sesshoumaru jegyese, meglepő módon.

Neptune határozottan megpróbálja körülvenni magát az emberekkel, mert szereti a barátait, és a kagome is nagyjából az ő típusa? mint ő édes, és ő egy erős nő, és ő valójában jobb barátok a nők, mint ő a férfiak, idk miért, ő csak szeret körülvéve női barátok, aki tudja.

Őszintén szólva még nem dolgozott át mindent, mivel lényegében egy teljes körű háború élén állt.

Tetszik az ötleted, hogy Kagome készít egy képet Elsáról!

Teljesen imádom az ötletet, hogy ez a két kiadási minőségi bff együtt csinálja a kicsi, de szórakoztató dolgokat, amelyeket Elsa soha nem tapasztalt gyermekként.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Miért érdemes a Twitteren<br/><br/>Jogi nyilatkozat: Nem vagyok, és soha nem is állítottam, hogy közösségi média guru. Én csak egy olyan ember vagyok, aki sokat gondolkodik a dolgokról, és ez többször felmerült.<br/><br/>Nem vagyok korai örökbefogadó. Néha évekbe telik, hogy kitaláljam, mire akarok valamit használni, mielőtt ténylegesen ráállok, és a Twitter egyike volt azoknak a dolgoknak. Komolyan vettem a Twitter-t ez év februárja óta, így elég új vagyok benne. Mégis, számos dolgot megtanultam, és meg akartam osztani őket. Vannak, akik azt mondják, hogy egy Twitter-toló vagyok, és az vagyok, mert sok jó oka van rá, és gyakorlatilag nincs hátránya.<br/><br/>Tehát mi a Twitter? Ha az interneten vagy, akkor valószínűleg legalább hallottál róla. Ez egy közösségi média hálózat, amely fórumként szolgál a beszélgetésekhez, frissítésekhez és hírekhez egy olyan médiumban, amely nyilvánosabb, mint valami, mint a Facebook vagy a LinkedIn. A Facebook arról szól, hogy ki akarja megtalálni Önt, de a Twitter arról szól, hogy kit szeretne megtalálni. Kedvenc írói, színészei, politikusai, énekesei és tudósai valószínűleg a Twitteren vannak. Akárcsak a kedvenc jótékonysági szervezetei, rádióállomásai, híroldalai és üzletei. És azt akarják, hogy megtalálja őket, és hallgassa meg, amit mondaniuk kell. Mindenki a Twitteren, legalábbis kezdetben, beszélni akar veled.<br/><br/>De miért csatlakoznál ehhez? Miért lennél benne? Mindenféle oka van, és adok neked egy párat.<br/><br/>Az emberek és helyek Twitter egy nagyszerű módja annak, hogy megtudja, események zajlanak szerte a világon, hanem a közösségben. Ha utazik, és keres dolgokat csinálni, ez egy nagyszerű módja annak, hogy megtudja, a dolgok relevánsak az Ön érdekeit (mert az emberek, akiket követsz, olyan emberek, akiket érdekel). Még akkor is, ha nem utazik, tudva a nagyszerű helyekről, hogy helyileg menjenek, vagy tudván, hogy az érdeklődő emberek meglátogatják őket, lehetőséget teremt arra, hogy találkozzanak velük, és mélyebb kapcsolatot alakítsanak ki velük. Ha visszamész a pártbejegyzésembe, kettő kivételével az összes ember, akiről hallottam a Twitteren, aztán találkoztam a való életben, és most már elég jó barátok vagyunk. És minél többet csinálod ezt, annál több dolgot fogsz megtudni, és annál több emberrel fogsz találkozni. És ha követed őket a Twitteren, akkor már tudsz egy kicsit arról, hogy milyenek. Azt akarják, hogy. A fordítottja is igaz, mert a tweetelés meghívja az embereket, hogy lássák, milyen vagy, és ugyanazokat a döntéseket hozhatják rólad.<br/><br/>Inspiráció és motiváció<br/>Az inspiráció a legfurcsább helyekről származik, és a tweetek beáramlása azt jelenti, hogy mindig friss tartalom van a képzeleted számára. Van egy első irányelvem, ezért követem szinte bárkit, majd rendszeresen átmegyek és nem követem az embereket. Nem tudom, ki fogja elültetni bennem egy új blogbejegyzés vagy új projekt magját, ezért szeretem nyitva tartani a lehetőségeimet. Motiváció is történik, mert a Twitter olyan, mint az élet. Ha olyan emberekkel veszed körül magad, akik ambiciózusak, elkötelezettek, nagylelkűek és keményen dolgoznak, könnyebb ilyennek lenni, és tolni magad. Könnyebb azt gondolni, hogy ha tudnak eseményeket tervezni, projekteket indítani, vagy csak reggel felkelni, akkor te is.<br/><br/>Tanulás és életmód bloggerek vannak a Twitteren. Azok a bloggerek, akik nem igazán őrültek. És az emberek blogolnak mindenről. Ha tanulni akarsz valamit, az esélyek jók, hogy valaki tweetel róla. Ráadásul a hírszolgáltatások és az üzletek is összekapcsolódnak, ami azt jelenti, hogy a híreket percről percre megkaphatja, és megtudhatja az értékesítést és az ajánlatokat, amikor elkezdik. Ami az életmódot illeti, új receptötleteket keres? Kövesse néhány vendéglátók, és mi jön ki. Szüksége van egy csavar, hogy koktélparti? Twitter van az emberek, hogy túl. Szekrény ajánlások, vagy csak szeretné látni, hogy mit más emberek csinálnak az életüket? Ez mind ott van.<br/><br/>Vannak közös kihívások, amikkel szembe kell néznem, amikor erről beszélek, és ezek jogos akadályok, amik elég ijesztőnek tűnhetnek, különösen, ha késel, ahogy én is tettem. Hónapokat töltöttem azzal, hogy csak két embert követtem, és nem tudtam, mit tegyek, de vannak módok, hogy legyőzzük őket, és halljuk, hogy a legkevésbé gyakoriak a legtöbb.<br/><br/>#3: A Twitter a nárcisztikus barmoknak való<br/>Azt hiszem, ez abból az ötletből származik, hogy a legtöbb ember tweetel magának és magáról, hogy felhívja magára a figyelmet. Amit nem értek, az az, hogy miért van valami baj ezzel, vagy miért csinál valaki egy nárcisztikus vagy egy bunkó. Ha valakinek mondanivalója van, azt akarja, hogy meghallgassák. Régebben az utcasarkon álltál és kiabáltál. Most 140 karakterrel vagy kevesebbel kiabálhatsz. A Twitter csak egy új módja annak, hogy meghallgassák. Most már biztosan vannak nárcisztikus bunkók a Twitteren. Néha az emberek bunkók, néha az egyik ilyen ember én vagyok, sajnálom, hogy ezt kell mondanom, de ne kövesd őket. Ha nem tetszik, amit valaki mond, függetlenül attól, hogy ezek olyan pontok, amelyeket a fürdőszobai tevékenységeiről készítenek, akkor nem kell hallgatnia a Twitteren.<br/><br/>2. Nem tudom nyomon követni az egészet<br/>A második akadály, amit az emberek gyakran felhoznak, az, hogy egyszerűen nincs idejük nyomon követni mindazt, ami a Twitteren történik. És tudod mit? Ez rendben van. Kövesse nyomon, amit tudsz. Talán csak néhány naponta vándorolsz. Ha egy privát felhasználó (nem pedig a tweeting a cég), és különösen egy kezdő, ez rendben van. Része valami jobb, mint az egész semmi.<br/><br/># 1 Nincs semmi, amit ki akarok tenni<br/>Ez messze a leggyakoribb kihívás, amit az emberek felvetnek. És ez nem is számít. Nem kell csatlakoznia a Twitterhez, hogy beszéljen. Csatlakozzon hozzá, hogy meghallgassa. Ismét itt vannak a kedvenc szerzők, énekesek, bloggerek és újságok. Itt a lehetőség, hogy meghallgassa őket. Itt a lehetőség, hogy betekintést nyerjen az életükbe és tevékenységeikbe, és meghívják Önt erre. Szeretné megtudni, hogy Felicia Day mit fog tenni a San Diego Comic Con-on? Kész. Ismerek olyan embereket, akik csak a Twitteren hallgatnak, és ez nagyszerű. Ezt tettem egy ideig. Végül talán találsz valamit, amiről tweetelhetsz, vagy csinálsz valamit, amiről tweetelhetsz. Remélem, mert hallani akarok róla.<br/><br/>Röviden, ha nem használja a Twittert, azt hiszem. Ha nem használja teljes mértékben, próbálja meg. Ne félj követni ötszáz embert, ha ezek az emberek olyan dolgokat mondanak, amelyek érdeklik. Hívd meg ezeket az embereket az életed részeire, és nézd meg, hogyan javul az interakció. Alig várom, hogy halljam tőled. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Gyökércsatornák<br/><br/>A gyökérkezelés megszerzésének gondolata a legtöbb embert élteti. Az SCM Dental a legújabb technológiát és technikát használja, hogy a gyökérkezelés gyakorlatilag fájdalommentes és alacsony stressz-eljárás legyen.<br/><br/>A rotációs endodontika egy fejlett technológia és technika az endodontikus kezelés elvégzéséhez, a gyökércsatorna klinikai kifejezéseA "gyökércsatorna" kifejezés a fog közepén lévő természetes üregre utal. A fog idege a gyökércsatornában található lágyszövetben (pulp) található. Ha a fogat trauma vagy bomlás károsítja, a törmelék beléphet az érzékeny gyökércsatorna területére, és fertőzést okozhat, vagy szélsőséges körülmények között, tályog. A tályogos fog nagyon súlyos, és vészhelyzetként kell kezelni, mivel olyan fertőzést okozhat, amely a test más részeire is átterjedhet. Ha úgy gondolja, hogy tályogos foga van, azonnal lépjen kapcsolatba irodánkkal a sürgősségi ellátás ütemezéséhez.<br/><br/>Az esettől függően a gyökérkezelés egynél több látogatást igényelhet. A kezdeti röntgenfelvételt a fog és a gyökércsatorna értékelésére, valamint a károsodás és a fertőzés mértékének meghatározására kell elvégezni, ha jelen van. Egyfajta érzéstelenítést kap, hogy ellazuljon.<br/><br/>Amikor a terület elzsibbad, a fogorvosunk egy elektromos kézi eszközzel hozzáférési kamrát hoz létre a gyökércsatornához. Ezután a gyökércsatornát a fertőzött vagy sérült szövetből és idegből kaparják. Miután az egész területet alaposan megtisztították és csiszolták, a fogat biokompatibilis gumikeverékkel, úgynevezett gutta percha-val töltik fel. A fogat ezután fogászati töltelékkel vagy fogászati koronával borítják, hogy helyreállítsák az erőt és a funkciót.<br/><br/>Az endodontikus terápia rossz hírnevet szerzett, mint egy fájdalmas eljárás. A rotációs endodontikával a gyökérkezelés eljárás nem fájdalmasabb, mint a fogászati tömés elhelyezése. A fertőzés és az idegkárosodás okozza a szélsőséges fájdalmat és kellemetlenséget, és a betegek a gyökérkezelés után jelentős megkönnyebbülést tapasztalnak. A gyökércsatornák 95% -os sikerességgel rendelkeznek, és lehetővé teszik az emberek számára, hogy megőrizzék természetes fogaikat. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard alsó fa<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard alsó fa, Highgate<br/><br/>Queen's Wood néven<br/><br/>1860 és 1880 között a központot kiszakították a City of Londonból, hogy csatornát, vasutat és új utakat építsenek. A házakat lebontották, tekintet nélkül a bérlőkre, akiknek bármilyen szállást kellett találniuk máshol. A menedzserek Kensingtonba és St. John's Woodba mentek livóba, míg a legszegényebbek olyan bástyákba tömörültek, mint a Seven Dials és a Lisson Grove. Azok között, a hivatalnokok és a képzett munkások, spekulatív építők fel sorról sorra teraszos villák és Mr Pooter költözött Holloway. A Muswell Hill lakói házakat néztek a Finsbury Park területén, a Crouch Hillen és a másik oldalon, így 1880-ra a Crouch Endet fejlesztették ki, és úgy tűnt, hogy nem lehet megállítani az áramlást. Tíz évvel később a Muswell Hill nagy birtokait eladták. Az Upton Farmot eladták, és az egyházi biztosok ki akarták fejleszteni a Churchyard Bottom Wood-ot, amelyet most Queen's Wood-nak hívnak. A történet egy Ibsen játékot készített volna. Két csoport őszinte, erősen motivált ember küzd azért, amiről azt gondolták, hogy helyes. Az egyházi biztosok és a Hornsey-i Jótékonysági Bizottság mind a ketten azt hitték, hogy mindent megtesznek másokért, és a közvélemény felháborodásában mindkettőjük ellen felkelt.<br/><br/>Abban az időben a Muswell Hill Road egy vidéki út volt, az egyik végén Southwood Hall és a másik Upton Farm. 1894-re Onslow Gardens épült, Connaught Gardens jelölve, és az építők készen álltak a Woodlands birtok fejlesztésére. A Churchyard Bottom Wood-ból kivágva egy csoport leomlott ház volt, egy háromszög alakú helyszínen. Az egyházi biztosok által tartott dátum nélküli térkép hat Wasteland Cottages-t mutat, amelyek között van egy nyílás - nem egy út, nem fémezett, hanem egy út az eperágyakhoz. Tovább haladt egy másik rés, amely gyalogutakhoz vezetett a fán keresztül. Ez a két nyílás volt a terv alapja. Ugyanaz a két rés és a megtisztított talaj, amely az epermező volt, az 1894-es térképen látható. Ezek a "Muswell Hill Cottages" -ként jelennek meg, és egészen véletlenül Peter Sellers sokkal később ugyanazon a helyszínen élt. Ahhoz, hogy a fát lakótelepként fejlesszék, a biztosoknak két utat kellett áthajtaniuk a Muswell Hill Roadról, és ezek mentén házakat kellett építeniük. A Muswell Hill Road homlokzata önmagában nem biztosított volna elegendő helyet a házak számára, hogy a vállalkozás érdemes legyen.<br/><br/>A földeket és a házakat sokkal korábban alamizsnaházként adták az öregeknek, és a Hornsey jótékonysági biztosok megbízottjai tartották őket. Az 1890-es évekre a házak leomlottak, nagy javításra szorulva. Közszellemű, a régi bérlőinek a legjobbat kívánva, a kurátorok nem tudtak javítani rajtuk, mivel pénzük nem volt. Néhány évvel azelőtt, hogy az egyházi biztosok azt tervezték, hogy a Gravel Pit Wood-ot (ma Highgate Wood) lakótelepként fejlesztik, de ez olyan ellenállásba ütközött, hogy meghátráltak. Ehelyett 1886-ban mind a 69 hektáros erdőt a nyilvánosságnak adták. Ugyanakkor felajánlották, hogy eladják a Churchyard Bottom Wood-ot a Hornsey Városi Kerületi Tanácsnak 25 000 fontért, de ez túl sok volt ahhoz, hogy Hornsey egyedül emeljen. A Tanács azt mondta, hogy a Hornsey-n kívül élő emberek is élvezték a fát, és más hatóságoknak segíteniük kell, de nem kaptak segítséget. Végül az ajánlat elmaradt.<br/><br/>Térkép mutatja a Muswell Hill Cottages, amelyek középpontjában a vita.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road 1880 körül<br/><br/>Valószínűnek tűnik, hogy ez a három házpár volt a vita középpontjában.<br/><br/>Az egyházi biztosok Nagy-Britanniában és külföldön is pénzt akartak gyűjteni egyházi munkájához. Úgy vélték, hogy megkapták azt a földet, amelyet a vallás propagálására használtak, és ha ez azt jelentette, hogy eladták a földet vagy az erdőket, akkor az kisebb rossz volt, mint az egyház munkájának korlátozása. Ők adták a Gravel Pit Wood-ot a nyilvánosságnak: a helyén a Churchyard Bottom Wood-ot fejlesztették ki.<br/><br/>A Hornsey Charities kuratóriuma jövedelmet akart termelni szegény népük megsegítésére, ezért ajánlatot tettek a biztosoknak. Háromszögletű földdarabjuk túlságosan esetlen alakú volt ahhoz, hogy gazdaságosan fejleszthessék, de ha a biztosok még egy kis földet adnának nekik, hogy négyzet alakúvá tegyék, huszonöt takaros villát építenének. Ezek évente 225 eurónyi földbérletet eredményeznének, amely a Hornsey-i emberek szegénységének enyhítésére lenne használható. Cserébe lehetővé tennék a Bizottság számára, hogy két utat vágjon át a földjükön, hogy a biztosok fejleszthessék az erdőket.<br/><br/>Amikor ez az ajánlat ismertté vált, az emberek azonnal reagáltak a riasztással.<br/><br/>1893. december 16-án Carvell Williams képviselő megkérdezte az alsóházban, hogy az egyházi biztosok beleegyeztek-e abba, hogy eladjanak egy darab földet a Hornsey Charities kuratóriumának, azzal a feltétellel, hogy egy meglévő utat 40 lábra szélesítenek ki, függetlenül attól, hogy ez egy építési terv előzetese volt-e, és hogy a Parlament házának lehetősége van-e véleményt nyilvánítani.<br/><br/>Leveson Gower, az egyházi ingatlanokért felelős biztos igennel válaszolt az első részre.<br/><br/>Mr. Carvell Williams: "Értem, hogy szándékában áll elpusztítani a Highgate Woods azon részét?"<br/><br/>Két nappal később a The Star minden modern bulvárlaphoz méltó cikket jelentetett meg.<br/><br/>A csillag<br/>1893. december 18.<br/><br/>A parlamentnek éberen figyelnie kell az egyházi biztosok régi vandáljait és szövetségeit; mindig elidegenítenek bizonyos földdarabokat, vagy előnyben részesítik az építőket a közvéleménnyel szemben. A biztosok nem adnák el a Churchyard Bottom fát a díjfizetőknek, de most azt javasolják, hogy "nyissák fel”, két széles utat vágva át rajta a számos építési tervük egyikével kapcsolatban. Nem fog valaki feltenni egy kérdést a Parlamentben, és ellenőrizni a biztosok tégla- és habarcspolitikáját?”<br/><br/>Mire ezt kinyomtatták, a kérdést feltették, és a válasz vagy hamis, vagy fondorlatos volt. Más újságok vették fel a történetet. A Times egy hosszú jelentésben azt írta, hogy a Comnussionerek nem voltak hajlandók kötelezettséget vállalni arra, hogy a Parlamentnek vagy bármely más állami szervnek lehetősége legyen arra, hogy a fa helyére építsen.<br/><br/>A helyzet tizennyolc hónapig tartott, amíg az egyházi biztosok kénytelenek voltak vizsgálatot indítani, amely 1895. május 31-én kezdődött Highgate-ben, egy egyházi biztos-asszisztens elnökletével. A vizsgálat egy sor olyan újságlevelet eredményezett, amelyek közül ez volt a legfontosabb.<br/><br/>A Daily Chronicle, 1895. június 5.<br/><br/>VANDALIZMUS A HIGHGATE-BEN<br/><br/>Uram...<br/><br/>A szuburán London egyik legcsodálatosabb erdeje veszélyben van. Segít nekünk elhárítani a katasztrófát, nem csak a közvetlen kerületre, hanem az egész sűrűn lakott Észak-Londonra? A metropolisz egyik részében sem volt aktívabb az építtető, mint Crouch Endben és Hornseyben. Az egy-két évvel ezelőtti gyönyörű rétek most házak és üzletek. Ballaszthalmok vették át a fenséges szilfák és gesztenyék helyét, és egykor kellemes falvak osztoztak Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury és Islington sorsában.<br/><br/>---- A tárgy két negyven láb hosszú út építése az erdőn keresztül. Mi ebben a kerületben tudjuk, mit jelent a negyven láb hosszú út az erdőn keresztül. Ez azt jelenti, hogy az erdő halálra van ítélve. Tíz évvel ezelőtt az agitáció megmentette a hatvan hektáros testvér-fát - a Kavicsos Pit Woods-ot - és senki, aki látta a Bank Holiday tömegeket az Archway úton a Holloway, Islington és Clerkenwell sivár utcáiról, és látta, hogy a gyermekek és a családi összejövetelek élvezete a fűben és a fák között piknikezik, nem tudta felismerni azt a hatalmas áldást, amelyet az egyházi biztosok nyújtanak. ----<br/><br/>Az egyházi biztosok birtokolják Hornsey nagy egyházközségének közel egyharmadát. A díjfizetők pénzének az utak megnyitására és a kerület általános fejlesztésére fordított liberális kiadásai révén vagyonuk értéke óriási mértékben megnőtt, és ebből a meg nem szolgált növekményből minden évben nagy bevételeket húznak. Bizonyos, hogy azok a kamatfizetők, akiknek a pénze így hozzájárult a hatalmas birtok létrehozásához, cserébe liberális bánásmódra számíthatnak.<br/><br/>engedelmesen,<br/><br/>Aláírta a The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, a Park Chapel minisztere, Crouch End, egy Onslow Gardensben élő ügyvéd és a Kerületi Tanács három tagja.<br/><br/>Ez egy lövés volt közvetlenül az egyházi biztosok orrán keresztül. Saját vallási vezetőik és a kerületi tanács, mind fegyverben, mondván, hogy az egyház túl gazdag, és jótékonyságinak kell lennie, nem pedig mohónak. A két lelkész bevonása ravasz lépés volt. Ne feledje, hogy ez még mindig a darwini vita csúcspontján volt. Darwin megosztotta az egyház tanításaiba vetett hitet, és sokan csak ebből a szempontból nehezményezték volna az egyház hatalmát. Az egyház nem volt annyira biztonságos, mint amilyennek tette magát.<br/><br/>Az Esti Hírek, június 7, 1895 azt mondta:<br/><br/>"Ha az Egyházi Ítélkezőket nem kezelik azonnal, az építő polip megragadja a fát, amelyet később nagyon nehéz lesz fellazítani. Ezért a londoniaknak fel kell kelniük, és meg kell tenniük, ha megmentik az egyik legszebb rusztikus tájat. A nyilvános vizsgálatot a következő csütörtökre halasztják, és még azelőtt tenni kell valamit, hogy meggyőzzék a biztosokat arról, hogy London polgárai nem fogják eltűrni egyik kedvenc játszóterük elkobzását.<br/><br/>Egy levél a Daily Chronicle másnap azt mondta:<br/><br/>... Nagy megkönnyebbülés volt, hogy a lakosok mintegy tíz évvel ezelőtt hallották, hogy a Felső-erdő megvásárlását végrehajtották; és milyen pompás áldásnak bizonyult ez, bárki, aki meglátogatta őket, tanúsíthatja, de mindenki, aki megpróbálta megmenteni ezeket a felső erdőket, amelyek a Muswell Hill út nyugati oldalán fekszenek, úgy érezte, hogy győzelmük nem teljes, amíg a keleti oldalon lévő hatvan hektár veszélyben van. Ez, mintha egy baleset, hogy az erdő van osztva egy széles, magas út. Van-e bárki is kétséges, mi lenne a hatása, ha a Gyülekezet Alsó Wood helyébe sorok kis villák, mindegyik küldi ki a hozzájárulást a füst és a korom? Kételkedhet-e bárki is abban, hogy milyen komoly változást hozna a megvásárolt erdők festői környezete, ha új, bámuló házak sora futna fel éppen a lombos homlokzatukra?<br/><br/>Ez sok ember véleményét kifejezte. Valójában a Gravel Pit Wood-ot, amelyet az író a "felső fa" -nak nevez, nem vásárolta meg, hanem az egyházi bizottság adta a kerületnek, amit az évek során újra és újra meg kellett ismételniük, de a legtöbb ember figyelmen kívül hagyta. A Bizottság nem akart egy második fát sem odaadni, bármit is mondtak, és ezt az álláspontot mindvégig megtartotta.<br/><br/>H. S. Chamberlain, az 5 Cranley Gardens-ből, 1895. június 8-án a Times-nak írt levelében sürgette a vásárlást.<br/><br/>Tudom, hogy ez gyakori, hogy durván beszélni az egyházi biztosok, stb, mint a vagyonkezelők egy alap kötelesek kezelni, hogy a legnagyobb előnye, és ezért, ha valamit tenni kell, hogy mentse a bontási a fa, úgy tűnik számomra, hogy csak akkor lehet elérni a vásárlás a tulajdon a Comnussioners, aki tudom, hogy teljesen élő védelme érdekében a szabad és nyitott terek az emberek.<br/><br/>(Ez a néhány évvel később biztosított Crouch End Playing Fields-re vonatkozik.)<br/><br/>A Muswell Hill Konzervatív Egyesület elnökeként folyamatosan tartom a kapcsolatot a lakossággal, és nyugodtan kijelenthetem, hogy minden lakó a környéken bármit megtenne, hogy megőrizze.<br/><br/>(Személy szerint csak jótékony jövedelmet akart szegényeinek eltartására. földbirtokát követelte - nem sokat biztosan -, hitt a biztosok biztosítékában, hogy a fa nincs veszélyben.)<br/><br/>"A Muswell Hill Road volt az egyik legjobb Hornsey-ben, és ugyanolyan szép maradt, házak vagy sem."<br/><br/>(És akkor jött a nagy retorika virágzása.)<br/><br/>Szenvednek-e a szegények a szentimentális ellenvetések és a tudósítóik által felvetett hisztérikus farkaskiáltások miatt? Egy hektárnyi terület hozzáadása a jótékonysághoz nem változtatna a megmaradt földterületen, míg az ebből származó haszon sok szegény öregnek és arra érdemesnek segítene a hanyatló években, és lehetővé tenné számunkra, hogy utódainknak olyan birtokot adjunk át, amely a távoli jövőben nagy értéket képviselne a Hornsey-i plébánia rászoruló szegényeinek nyújtott jótékonysági támogatásban.<br/><br/>Levelét olvasva az ember a felszínhez nagyon közel érez hisztériát. Miért gondolta, hogy a biztosok utat akarnak építeni? Miért költsék el azt a sok pénzt, ha nem házak építésére? Úgy tűnt, soha nem veszi észre, hogy egy hektár föld az egész fa elvész. De ő volt a probléma sokáig. Ő volt az a személy, akinek a biztosok 25 000 évvel ezelőtt felajánlották az eladási ajánlatot, és az ő nevét tisztelik a Crouch End Clock Tower egyik emléktábláján a fa megmentéséért, de az egyházi biztosokba vetett bizalma naivnak tűnik. Szomorú, hogy a vizsgálatkor ördögnek kellett őt vetni.<br/><br/>A vizsgálat folytatódik<br/><br/>Az ülést 1895. június 15-én nyitották meg Highgate-ben. Nagy összejövetelre számítottak, a tanácstermet teljesen megváltoztatták. A szokásos asztalokat eltávolították, és a helyiséget székekkel töltötték meg. Fél hétkor a szoba zsúfolt volt, az emberek lökdösődtek az ülésekért.<br/><br/>Murray úr, a biztos azt mondta, hogy a vizsgálat valóban egyszerű volt. A Hornsey Parochial Charities egy olyan földterületet szeretett volna vásárolni, amely hátul a jótékonysági tulajdonukkal szomszédos. A kérdés az volt, hogy az összes jótékonysági szervezetet irányító Jótékonysági Bizottság rendelkezik-e elegendő hatalommal ahhoz, hogy megállítsa őket. Az egyházi biztosok készek voltak arra, hogy nagyon kedvező feltételekkel adják el a földet, és a Jótékonyság bevételei igen jelentősen megnövekednének.<br/><br/>Ez ellen három kifogási osztály volt.<br/><br/>Az eredeti tröszt célja az volt, hogy házakat biztosítson a szegényeknek, de a vagyonkezelők olyan villák építését javasolták, amelyek túl drágák lennének a szegények számára. A kuratórium hatáskörén belül állt azonban a Tröszt feltételeinek változtatása, így villákat építhettek, ha úgy gondolták, hogy a szegényeknek a végén hasznára válik. Maguk a szegények is tiltakozhatnának, de nekik már liberális rendelkezéseket ígértek. A harmadik ellenvetés a kérdés esztétikai és közéleti oldalára vonatkozott. Abból, amit olvasott, arra következtetett, hogy a Jótékonysági Bizottságnak közbe kell avatkoznia, hogy megakadályozza az egyházi biztosokat abban, hogy saját mérlegelési jogkörüket gyakorolják a tulajdonukkal kapcsolatban.<br/><br/>Az Inquiry megvitatta a finom pontokat, de a felszólalók folyamatosan visszatértek a fa pusztulásának megakadályozásának fő problémájához. A 300 000 embert képviselő islingtoni Vestry Clerk formálisan tiltakozott a fa bármely része ellen, amely annyira értékes volt az Islington és Hornsey népe számára, hogy magáncélokra használták. Wilfred White azt mondta, hogy ha a biztosok időt adnak nekik, képesek lesznek összegyűjteni a pénzt, hogy kompenzálják a megbízottakat.<br/><br/>Beaumont úr azt mondta, hogy nem villákat akarnak, hanem házakat a szegény emberek számára, akiket elűznek a kerületből. Mások azt mondták, hogy nem volt pénz a házak építésére, hogy helyettesítsék a jelenlegi lepusztultakat, de a villák gazdasági javaslat lenne. Mások azt állították, hogy vannak olyan villák, amelyeket be kell engedni Highgate-be. A fa szent volt. Maradjunk a fa kérdésénél.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher azt mondta, hogy a dolgozó emberek között az volt a kiáltás, hogy nincs hová menni. A dolgozó emberek odajöttek hozzá azzal a kiáltással, hogy "Ki vagyunk űzve Highgate-ből, és kötelesek vagyunk Highgate New Town-ba menni." Ha a Muswell Hill Road homlokzatát eladták, nem volt kérdés, hogy az utakat át lehet vágni az erdőn Hornsey irányába, de ha a biztosok nem tudták megszerezni a földet a jótékonysági bizottságtól, nem tudták elvágni az utat.<br/><br/>Nagyon biztos volt benne, hogy a házakat rendbe lehet hozni. A szegény emberek, a rendőrség és számos munkásosztály felkérte, hogy képviselje ezt a két pontot, hogy a nyaralók elhelyezésére nagyon nagy szükség van Highgate-ben, és hogy ha egyszer megengedik, hogy eladják a földet, nem lehet megmondani, hol marad az építő keze.<br/><br/>(Hangos és hosszan tartó éljenzés).<br/><br/>Sok más ember is felszólalt, és a Comnussioner azt mondta, hogy úgy véli, hogy az uralkodó vélemény a házak megtartását támogatja, de a találkozó nem vonhat le következtetéseket abból, amit mondott (Groans).<br/><br/>Mások azt mondták, hogy a Jótékonyság Kuratóriuma elmulasztotta a kötelességét azzal, hogy hagyta, hogy a kunyhók romba dőljenek.<br/><br/>H. R. Williams úr, a megbízott, aki korábban írt az újságnak, azt mondta, hogy a legjobb felhatalmazással rendelkezik, hogy az egyházi biztosok semmilyen utat nem tesznek, és nem részesülnek a jótékonysági biztosok cselekedeteiből. Mások sokkal kevésbé bíztak, és a találkozó közel három óra múlva zárult le.<br/><br/>Szembe kell néznünk azzal a ténnyel, hogy Highgate-ben és a Muswell Hill-ben számos ember van, aki a Churchyard Bottom Wood-ot akarja, és nem lesz boldog, amíg meg nem kapja - miközben úgy tűnik, senki sem hajlandó egy fityinget sem költeni érte. Mindenki azt mondja, hogy jó lenne, ha a fa nyitott tér lenne, de mindenki úgy gondolja, hogy valaki másnak kötelessége, hogy azzá tegye. Az Islington Vestry "megoldotta" a témát, de az Islington Vestry nem kínál egy fillért sem a vásárlás felé. Nincs nehezebb probléma, amit a közösségnek vagy az egyénnek meg kell oldania, mint az, hogy hogyan szerezze meg mások tulajdonát anélkül, hogy fizetne érte.<br/><br/>A fizetés valóban a probléma volt, mivel a Churchyard Bottom Wood intenzív helyi és országos vita tárgya lett. Közös bizottság alakult a fa megmentésére. 1896. november 20-án C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, írt a The Standard napilapnak, amely akkoriban segítséget kért. Emlékeztetett mindenkit a fa elvesztésének veszélyére, és azt mondta, hogy csak a vásárlással lehet megmenteni. Az egyházi biztosok 25 000 fontért és egy extra összegért (ötezer dollárra lenne szükség a kerítéshez és a vízelvezetéshez, így összesen 30 000 fontra. Ez túl sok volt a Hornsey Tanács számára, de már 10 000 fontot szavaztak meg a teljes összegre. Az erdők felbecsülhetetlen értékűek voltak egész Észak-London számára, ezért köztestületekhez és magánemberekhez fordult, hogy emeljék meg a fennmaradó 20 000 fontot. Figyelmeztetett, hogy az egyházi biztosok jelen ajánlata csak 1898 végéig áll nyitva. Ezután az építők költöztek be.<br/><br/>A fellebbezést melegen üdvözölte a sajtó. A privát törvényjavaslatot sietett keresztül Parlament és a Highgate Woods megőrzéséről szóló törvény, 1897, vált törvény. A Conunittee most már a jogot, hogy reklámozzák hozzájárulások megvásárlásához a Wood és megőrzése.<br/><br/>Meglehetősen rövid idő alatt szinte az összes pénzt előteremtették, de az utolsó néhány ezret nagyon nehéz volt előteremteni, és a biztosok határideje csak hetek kérdése volt. Cory-Wright több időt kért, de csak három hónapot kapott, és csak akkor, ha a teljes összegre vonatkozó extra időszakra 4 százalékos kamatot fizettek. Végül a London County Council, amely eredetileg 2500 fontot ajánlott fel, elérte az 5000 fontot, és elérte a teljes összeget, de ez egy közeli dolog volt.<br/><br/>A Tanács úgy döntött, hogy átnevezi az erdőt "Queen's Woods" tiszteletére Viktória királynő Diamond Jubilee és Hornsey tett egy finom kijelző bunting, amikor a hercegné Albany hivatalosan kijelentette, hogy a Wood nyitott "a szabad felhasználás a nyilvánosság örökre".<br/><br/>Míg a Churchyard Bottom Wood megmentéséért folytatott kampányt helyi emberek vezették és irányították, akik szenvedélyesen érezték ezt az erdőt, segítségül hívták egy hatalmas hálózat segítségét és tapasztalatait, akik közül néhányan több mint harminc éve dolgoztak együtt hasonló kampányokon. A bizottság felhívást adott ki, nagyon jó minőségű papírra nyomtatva és néhány híres nevet viselve.<br/><br/>A nyitott tér és a közegészségügy kérdései a viktoriánus látomás fő témái voltak.<br/><br/>A Nyílt Tér Mozgalom<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, a nagy lakásreformer, aki három régi házzal kezdett Marylebone-ban, amelyet Jolm Ruskin vásárolt neki, gyorsan szakértővé vált a szegény emberek lakhatásában a lehető legegészségesebb körülmények között. Az ő módszere az volt, hogy lízinget vett, majd lerombolt néhány zsúfolt házat, hogy fényt és levegőt hozzon a többieknek, abban a hitben, hogy a friss levegő és a napfény az egyetlen módja annak, hogy a szegény embereket megmentsék a láztól. Ezt gyerekkorában tanulta meg nagyapjától, Southwood Smith-től, aki a King's Cross-i lázkórházban dolgozta ki elméleteit.<br/><br/>Ő építette az első ipari lakásokat a szegények számára, és statisztikailag bizonyította, hogy a jó levegő és a tisztességes vízelvezetés életeket mentett. A Gibson Gardens, a Northwold Roadban, Southwood Smith ötleteinek közvetlen eredménye.<br/><br/>A nyitott levegő fontossága<br/><br/>A nyílt terek és a tiszta levegő lehetősége elengedhetetlen volt az egy vagy két zsúfolt szobában élő emberek számára. Octavia Hill a Lisson Grove nyomornegyedekből, a Fitzjohn sugárútjától a Hampstead Heath-ig vitte. Annyira szerette a Fitzjohn sugárúti mezőket, hogy megpróbálta megvásárolni őket nyilvános parkként. 10 000 fontba került volna, és három augusztus héten belül 8 500 fontot emeltek. Csak a nyári szünet végét és a szimpatikus barátok nyaralásából való visszatérést és a további 1500 fontot kellett volna emelni, de a tulajdonosok hirtelen visszavonták ajánlatukat. Minden könyörgés ellenére a mezőket nagy házakkal borították.<br/><br/>Ebből fejlődött ki a Parliament Hill, a Lisson Grove-tól északra fekvő következő szabad terület megmentésére irányuló kampány, az építők útjába eső mezőket felvásárolva, hogy állandó kordont készítsenek az előrenyomuló téglák ellen. A Parlament Hill Fields kampány annyira sikeres volt, hogy a Hampstead Heath törvényjavaslatot elfogadták, és a fellebbezésből pénz származott. Ebből a pénzből és a nyílt terek felé irányuló lendületből a Nemzeti Bizalom fejlesztése volt. Octavia Hill évek óta érdekelt volt az olyan területek védelmében, mint a Church Bottom Wood, így természetes szövetségese volt a Wood megmentéséért folytatott harcban.<br/><br/>A Commons Preservation Society szintén ismerte ezt a fajta agitációt és pénzgyűjtést. Lerombolták a kerítést, amikor a kastély urai lezárták a közös föld darabjait, jogi és illegális csatákat vezetve a hagyományosan szabad földek arrogáns privatizációja ellen. Robert Hunter, az 1868-as tiszteletbeli solicitor, mindig is a nyílt terek biztosításával foglalkozott, legyen az kicsi vagy nagy, a nyilvánosság számára. Ő, most Sir Robert Hunter, az egyház alsó fellebbezésének elnöke lett. A Commons Preservation Society elnöke Shaw-Lefevre képviselő (később Lord Eversley) volt, aki nagy szerepet játszott ebben és más kampányokban az Alsóházban. Octavia Hill körülbelül 1875-től részt vett munkájukban.<br/><br/>Ezzel egy időben Octavia Hill egy temetési törvényjavaslatért kampányolt.<br/><br/>A városi temetők annyira megteltek és olyan súlyos veszélyt jelentettek az egészségre, hogy az emberek ivóvizét szennyező kutak beszennyezésével a városi temetkezések többé nem engedélyezettek. Ehelyett temetőket hoztak létre a város szélén. Abney Park temető volt az egyik ilyen. Ezután volt egy mozgalom, hogy távolítsa el a sírköveket a szélén a régi város temetők, újra a testek máshol, és kapcsolja be a temetők kertek és nyílt terek, ahelyett, hogy épít rájuk. Ez a föld London központjában nagyon értékes volt, és a spekulánsok lelkesek voltak, hogy megszerezzék: Még a kvékerek is építettek az egyik temetőjük felett, és azzal fenyegettek, hogy ismét ezt teszik a Bunhill Fields építésével. Octavia Hillnek egy tucat területen volt szövetségesi hálózata, így a Church Bottom Wood megmentéséhez nyújtott segítsége felbecsülhetetlen volt.<br/><br/>Az 1882-ben létrehozott Metropolitan Gardens Society 1890-re mintegy kétszáz kis kertet hozott létre a városközpontokban, amelyeket később átadtak a helyi hatóságoknak, így a kezdetektől biztosították a Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal támogatását.<br/><br/>A Kyrle Társaság mára feledésbe merült, de a maga idejében nagy hatással volt a várostervezésre és a nyílt térre vonatkozó jogszabályokra. A Társaságot 1875 körül hozták létre a "szépség diffúziója" érdekében, hogy színt és érdeklődést hozzon az unalmas, szürke környezetben élő emberek életébe. Világos szín a falak és a dekoráció, a jó ének, a nyílt terek, a természet, az irodalom és a művészet. Mindezek a Társaság hatáskörébe tartoztak. Volt egy dekoratív ág, akinek William Morris előadást tartott; egy zenei ág a kórusok és a boldog esték népszerűsítésére a helyi iskolai épületekben; és egy irodalmi ág. A Társaság rendszeresen fellebbezett a The Times-ban, a "gazdagabb osztályok" számára, hogy könyveket és folyóiratokat osszanak ki a fiúk és lányok klubjaiba, alamizsnákba és más helyekre. Azonban a Nyílt Tér Bizottság volt a legaktívabb. A "Kyrle" név a Pope's The Man of Ross-ból származik, a filantrópból, aki az embereket nyilvános parkként adta. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Hálaadáskor a sarkon, itt van néhány ünnepi dosszié játékok tettünk a lányok. Mindkét hálaadás játékok középpontjában a matematikai készségek. És hálás vagyok még egyszer, hogy a férjem, Ed, hogy az összes clipart nekem.<br/><br/>Hálaadás Minta készítése<br/><br/>Ahogy a neve is mondja, ez a játék arról szól, hogy a minták. A kicsik csak tanulni minták, egyszerűen egyezik a képeket a minta csíkok, míg mások továbbra is a minta a képkártyák az üres csíkok.<br/><br/>A fájlmappa elkészítéséhez ki kell vágnia a képek rácsát, hogy a kártyadarabokat elkészítse. Azt javaslom, hogy laminálja őket, hogy segítsen nekik tovább tartani. Ezután ragasztsa a mintacsíkokat a fájl mappába.<br/><br/>Azt akartam, hogy az üres minta csíkok is, hogy a lányok láthatják, hol kell folytatni a mintát, és hány feküdt ki. A mappa oldalára ragasztottam őket szalaggal, hogy behajthassák a játékot, és kiterjeszthessék a mintát.<br/><br/>Hozzáadtam egy extra üreset is, hogy a lányok is elkészíthessék a saját mintájukat.<br/><br/>Törökország szám játék<br/><br/>Ebben a játékban a lányok hozzáadják a tollakat a pulyka testéhez, miközben gyakorolják a számlálást és a számfelismerést. A színtelen tollakat arra használtam, hogy útmutatóként szolgáljak a tollak hozzáadásához, és hogy a lányok megfeleljenek a számoknak. És győződjön meg róla, amikor leragasztja a pulykatestet, csak a középpontba ragasztja, hogy a szárnydarabok csúszhassanak a test alatt.<br/><br/>Miután kiterítettük az összes tollat, gyakorolunk néhány egyszerű aritmetikát, például elveszünk három tollat, és megnézzük, hogy hány maradt, majd hozzáadunk kettőt, hogy lássuk, mi az egyenlő.<br/><br/>A fekete-fehér szárnyak mellett egy színtelen pulykát is mellékeltünk, ha azt szeretné, hogy a kicsik színesítsék a saját készletüket. Ahelyett, hogy egy dosszié játék akkor viszont ez egy kézműves, színezés a darabokat, vágás őket, és ragasztás őket össze.<br/><br/>Egy másik lehetőség az, hogy a darabokat, hogy egy nemez fórumon történet. Néha énekeljük a pulyka változata 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Így:<br/><br/>Ki vagyok én?<br/><br/>Azt hiszem, ez az a pont, ahol valami szellemeset kell mondanom magamról. Nos. Otthoni anya vagyok három fantasztikus gyereknek - az ikerlányainknak, akik most hét évesek, és egy kétéves fiúnak, aki tele van energiával. Gyerekkorom előtti életemben tanár voltam, és most otthon tanítom a gyermekeinket. Én is Ed felesége vagyok, aki jelenleg a légierőben szolgál, és életem szerelme (kínos lenne, ha nem lenne). A családunk nagy a könyvekben, a kézművességben és a közös szórakozásban. Csak arra gondoltam, hogy megosztom tevékenységünket az internet saját kis sarkában.<br/><br/>Úgy tűnik, Zoe-nak mindene megvan - gazdag, jóképű férj, könnyű New York-i élet - de elkövetett hibákat a múltjában, és ezek a hibák visszatérnek az új életében. A könyv nagy részében a helyem szélén találtam magam, és meglepődtem...<br/><br/>Szerettem ezt a könyvet, szeretem a történetet, és hálás vagyok Margot Shetterly hozta napvilágra. Az egyetlen panaszom az volt, hogy azt kívántam, hogy Katherine Johnson szerepét a későbbi küldetésekben egy kicsit jobban megvitassák, de azt hiszem, a történetnek véget kellett vetnie ...<br/><br/>Azt akartam, hogy tetszik ez a könyv, és én végig a legtöbb.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | A 21 év alatti személyek alkoholfogyasztását jelentős közegészségügyi problémaként azonosították. Tanulmányok megjegyzik, hogy növeli a fogyatékosság kockázatát, és káros lehet a fejlődő agyra. Azok a kiskorúak, akik isznak, nagyobb valószínűséggel követnek el öngyilkosságot, szegik meg a törvényt, vagy válnak erőszak áldozatává. Az alkohol a fiatalok halálos kimenetelű közlekedési baleseteinek közel egyharmadában játszik szerepet. A fiatalkorúak alkoholfogyasztásának teljes éves költsége becslések szerint 62 milliárd dollár. Míg a kiskorúak ivásának megakadályozását célzó legtöbb törvényt állami szinten fogadják el, szövetségi szintű jogalkotási tevékenység és érdeklődés van az államoknak a probléma megfékezésére irányuló erőfeszítéseinek támogatására. Ez a jelentés ismerteti a kiskorúak alkoholfogyasztásának mértékét, a témával kapcsolatos közelmúltbeli jogalkotási tevékenységet és a különböző szakpolitikai következményeket. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Nem a politikai lobbizás vagy a nyilvános petíciók eredményezték az élelmiszerreformot, hanem az alulról jövő erőfeszítések, amelyeket az állampolgárok vezettek, akiknek hatalma van a tényleges végrehajtáshoz és a változáshoz.<br/><br/>Befejeztem a posztot egy kérdésre utalva: Miért olyan nehéz ezt nekünk, mint egyéneknek? Ha egy egész ország képes megvalósítani és terjeszteni egy közös nézetet az élelmiszerekkel kapcsolatban, miért nem tudjuk?<br/><br/>A probléma az, hogy elárasztanak minket az üzenetek arról, hogy mit kellene ennünk, és hogyan kellene élnünk, nehéz eldönteni, hol kezdjük. Tehát ahelyett, hogy olyan sikeres keretrendszereket követnének, amelyekről kimutatták, hogy működnek (mint például a Nordic Food Manifesto), a legtöbb ember a diétás őrületből a diétás őrületbe ugrik, és megpróbálja megtalálni a "helyes étkezési módot".<br/><br/>De hogyan sikerült Claus Meyer? Mi volt a titkos szósz, amely segített a Manifesto megragadni? És ésszerű-e azt gondolni, hogy ezeket a leckéket alkalmazhatjuk a saját életünkre?
