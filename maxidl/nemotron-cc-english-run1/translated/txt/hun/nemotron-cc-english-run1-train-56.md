| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Miközben elismerjük, hogy lehetetlen meggyőzni valakit arról, hogy szeressen valamit, amit utál, és fordítva, még mindig gyakran élvezetes az érvelés. Amikor olyan emberekkel beszélünk, akiknek a véleménye közvetlenül ellentmond a miénknek, kénytelenek vagyunk megvédeni az ízlésünket, meghatározni a véleményünket, és elemezni, hogy miért reagálunk úgy, ahogy. Ezért van a Why Don't You Like This?, amelyben két munkatársunk megpróbálja felfedezni, hogy az ellentétes véleményű emberek túljuthatnak-e a "Nem, tévedsz!" -on, és civilizált, konstruktív, és esetleg meggyőző vitát folytatnak a vitás pontjaikról. Mert nem számít, mit mond a rádió, még mindig van egy középút a "Teljesen egyetértünk" és a "Igazam van, és hülye és gonosz vagy."<br/><br/>Scott: Amióta a Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World hitehagyásomról beszélünk, egy olyan ügyet keresünk, ahol kihívhatlak, amiért nem szerettél valami csodálatosat, és nem kellett sokáig keresnünk. Egymás mellett ültünk Martin Scorsese Hugo-én, akit teljesen elbűvölt a korai néma mozi csodáinak fantasztikus tisztelete, és te, látszólag minden alkalommal ellenálltál. A kritikus konszenzus az én oldalamon állt: a 9. helyet érte el a kollektív Top 15-ön (bár túlértékelt választásként soroltad fel), különböző filmkritikusi díjakban nyert (vagy helyezett), és jelenleg 83-as pontszámot élvez a Metacritic-en. Természetesen ez nem jelenti azt, hogy tévedsz, de a te felelősséged, hogy megmagyarázd, hogy Hugo miért volt, a te szavaid szerint, "üreges és mesterséges", ahol sokan úgy tekintettünk rá, mint Scorsese gyermekkorának és médiumának kedves felidézésére, amikor még gyerekcipőben járt. És kérlek, légy gyengéd, ahogy széttéped ezt a pillangót a szárnyaidnál fogva.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Tasha: Nem tudok gyengéd lenni, Scott. Néha kevésbé fáj, ha egyszerre letéped a ragtapaszt. (És ha nem is, ki akar félbeszakadt ragtapaszt viselni? Undorító.) A tény az, hogy Hugo-t egy fárasztóan manipulatív gyakorlatnak találtam a hamisításban, kezdve a párizsi vasútállomáson való megnyitásától, ami mindennél jobban emlékeztetett Robert Zemeckis Polar Expresszére. Mike D'Angelóval ellentétben én a hosszú, töretlen felvételek rajongója vagyok, mint egy hely megteremtésének módja, és arra ösztönzi a nézőket, hogy öntudatlanul tartsák a lélegzetüket, miközben egy kamera felfedez egy területet; de amikor a feltárt tér egy sima, fényes CGI alkotás, és a kamera súlytalanul lebeg rajta, fizikai érzék nélkül, hogy sem a kamera, sem a környezet valóban ott van, ez a felfedezés olyan érzés, mintha valaki más videojátékot játszana. És a film többi része is hasonlóan pórustalannak és irreálisnak tűnt számomra, mind a beállítását, mind a rendkívül kitalált, maudlin történetét tekintve.<br/><br/>Nem feltétlenül van problémám a gyártott, stilizált környezetekkel a filmben. Szerettem Baz Luhrmann egyformán burjánzó, teljesen mesterséges felvételét Párizsról a Moulin Rouge-ban, például, de ennek a filmnek megvan a maga nevetségessége, humorérzéke arról, hogy milyen szándékosan túl van a tetején. Jean-Pierre Jeunet stilizálásával, különösen Amélie-ben. (Jeunet és Luhrmann is erős vizuális hatásnak érezte itt magát.) Az volt az érzésem, hogy Martin Scorsese azt akarta, hogy Hugo-t teljesen komolyan vegyem. Még akkor is, ha ez egy újabb fájdalmasan szentimentális történet egy bátor árváról, aki visszahozza a színt egy mogorva vén curmudgeon életébe.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Nincs semmi, amit jobban élveznék a filmben, mint a meglepettség, és nincs semmi, amit jobban neheztelnék és ellenállnék, mint hogy nyíltan manipulálnak, hangosan megmondják, mit és mikor kell érezni. A jó film finoman csinálja ezt a dolgot; a rossz pedig zúzós zenei jeleket és édes húrokat használ - és ebben az esetben egy mogorva, hatalmas szemű, zilált árva szomorúan bámul a kamerába -, hogy követelje a pátoszt, és elmondja a nézőknek, hogy szörnyű emberek, ha nem szolgálják fel igény szerint. Ennek ellenére foglalkozhatok szomorú gyerekekkel és mogorva felnőttekkel, akik jobbá teszik egymás életét - nagyon ástam az idei Le Havre-t, amely lényegében ugyanaz a cselekmény volt, anélkül, hogy minden cukiság lenne -, de úgy találom, hogy a mesterséges környezet rosszul tükrözi a mesterséges érzelmeket, és mindegyik a másikat hamisabbá teszi.<br/><br/>Kezdjük azzal, hogy a mi figyelmen kívül hagyott film videó, Ön és Noel egyaránt elvitte Keith a feladat a bajnok Tyrannosaurus, mert úgy érezte, hogy nem volt elég reális - túl kiagyalt, túl fösvény, túl sok, túl messzire. Hogyan lehetséges, hogy nem lehet megvenni egy megrögzött vén bolondot, aki összetöri a dolgokat, amikor dühös, de meg lehet vásárolni egy árva élő belsejében egy hatalmas vonat-állomás óra és elindul egy szeszélyes utazás megjavítani egy titokzatos automata, hogy úgy gondolja, lehet, hogy titkokat az ő halott apja, de ami ehelyett vezeti őt egy furcsa utazás az önfelfedezés, a varázslatos föld a mozi? Soha nem találta Hugo giccses rokokó designját, agresszív szívdobogását vagy talicskázását, még egy kicsit is túlzott vagy nehezen lenyelhető?<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet és Luhrmann mint befolyás Scorsese-re?! Felejtsd el a tapintatlanságot, most szándékosan szúrsz egy éles bottal. Ha inspirációt keresel Hugo számára - sőt, ha Hugo érzelmi magját keresed - vissza kell menned Scorsese gyermekkorába az Elizabeth Streeten, Kis-Olaszországban, ahol egy asztmás kisfiú, aki nem tud játszani a többi gyerekkel, visszavonult Alexander Korda fantáziáihoz, mint a Bagdad tolvaja. Vagy egyszerűbben, csak menjen egyenesen a forráshoz: George Mélies, akinek az Utazás a Holdba továbbra is az összes filmes fantáziák ősrobbanása, az a pillanat, amikor a fényképezőgépet nem arra használták, hogy dokumentálja a világot, ahogy van, de bármilyen szeszélyes, varázslatos, transzporter helyet, amelyet a filmkészítő fel akar találni. És ezt a hagyományt évtizedeken át fejlesztették és bővítették, mielőtt Jeunet és Luhrmann hozzáértek volna a piszkos kis mancsukhoz.<br/><br/>És ha már Jeunet-ről beszélünk, szép próbálkozás, hogy elvegyem a retorikai fegyveremet, de azért mégis kimondom: Hogy lehet szeretni Amélie-t, mégis szintetikusnak és "túlzónak" és "fárasztóan manipulatívnak" találni Hugót? Ön azt mondja, hogy Amélie és Moulin Rouge megváltja "a saját nevetségességüket", ahol Scorsese azt jelenti, hogy komolyan vesszük Hugót, és nem hiszem, hogy ez a helyzet, legalábbis az utóbbi ponton. Scorsese-nek nyilvánvaló szenvedélye van a filmek iránt, azt hiszem, ezért értelmezed Hugo-t önkomolynak, de számomra ezek az érzések adják a filmnek azt az érzelmi ballasztot, amivel a Luhrmann és Jeunet filmek nem rendelkeznek. Mindhárom film agresszíven használja a CGI csodáit – és Scorsese 3D-t ad hozzá a keverékhez, csodálatos hatással – de ahol te és én eltérünk, a súlytalanság kérdése. Egyetértek azzal, hogy a CGI-nek távoltartó hatása van; a teljes egészében digitális gyurmából álló világok olyan mértékben rugalmasak, hogy néha nincs is jelenlétük. Hugo-t a "Túlértékelt" bejegyzésében a "Best Of Film" darabunkban "CGI gimcrack" -nek nevezte - tökéletes disz ... egy másik filmhez.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Mondhatjuk, hogy Scorsese egy standard kiadású, "szívszorító" gyerekkönyv/film cselekmény köré építette fel Hugót: Árvának hiányzik az apja, megteremti a saját kis fantáziavilágát, ráveti magát egy új barátra, meggyőzi a kérges, régi, bolyhos-duddyt, hogy lágyuljon meg, és talán adoptálja. De ez még csak az elbeszélő csontváz, és Scorsese bővelkedik húsban és vérben. Először is, nem nézheti Hugo-t, a magányos fiút, aki az óratornyoktól a párizsi vasútállomás nyüzsgéséig néz, anélkül, hogy Scorsese-re, egy másik magányos fiúra gondolna, aki a hálószobája ablakán bámul ki az Elizabeth Street-en. És még ha nem is vagy elég nagy film stréber ahhoz, hogy ezt a kapcsolatot, úgy érzem, Hugo útja nem az, hogy új apafigurát találjon, hanem az, hogy kitartson a mechanikus varázslat mellett, ami a saját apja öröksége. Ez a film: A vízió tartóssága, amely lehetővé teszi számunkra, hogy elfogadjuk a világ illúziós változatát másodpercenként 24 képkockával, egyszerre tudomány és varázslat. Hugo kapcsolata Mélies-szel nem arról szól, hogy egy új apával barátkozik, hanem arról, hogy osztozik a közös lelkesedésben, amit az öreg keserűségbe süllyedt.<br/><br/>Tényleg nem találtad Hugo-t elbűvölőnek? Még a film néhány becsmérlője is hajlandó elismerni, hogy a filmtörténetet és Méli stúdióját idéző jelenetek - Michael Stuhlbarg hősies filmtudósként! - fantasztikusak voltak. Úgy éreztem, a lehető legjobb módon, mint egy éles tömörítés az én History Of Film 101 osztály az egyetemen, sűrítve egy félévnyi klipek és a kontextus valami között egy montázs és egy animációs pop-up könyv. És a film ötletes tervezéséről szól, amely olyan gyönyörűen rétegezi a tényeket és a fantáziát, hogy egyszerre Mélies története és a mozi születése, és csak az a fajta egyszerű, pazarul előállított filmes csoda, amelyet Scorsese maga szeretett volna gyermekkorában. Hála az égnek, Hugo nem követi a Jeunet/Luhrmann-modellt, és "saját nevetségességének érzete van". Mint egy fantázia szakértő, nem gondolja, hogy érdemes lenne becsületesen és komolyan és szégyentelenül játszani, ahelyett, hogy a közönségre kacsintgatna? Lehet, hogy Hugót betegesen édesnek találja, de nem hiszem, hogy az érzés hitelességét tagadni kell.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Tasha: Igen, valóban találtam részeket Hugo varázslatos. (Figyelj, hogyan válaszolok a kérdésre előre, míg te túl elfoglalt habzás apoplexy foglalkozni az enyém, bár feltételezem, hogy ez egy válasz a saját jogán. Oké, a "befolyás" lehet, hogy túlbecsüli az esetet - csak úgy értettem, hogy a vizuális stílus nagyon ismerősnek tűnt. Bár ahogy Keith rámutatott, amikor ezt személyesen felvetette, Scorsese nem ellenzi, hogy más emberek látványából merítsen inspirációt, és nem is immunis rá.) Elsősorban azok a részek bűvöltek el, amelyek Georges Mélies háttértörténetével, a moziszeretetével, a művészetébe fektetett művével és az abból kitörő örömmel foglalkoztak. Borzasztóan sok a szépség és a szórakozás a víz alatti pálya jelenetének megrendezésében Mélies "Fairyland"-jéből, és a végén lévő jelenetsorban, Méli's felvételeire koncentrálva. Elismerem, hogy Hugo kapcsolata Mélies-szel a film iránti közös szeretet miatt jó érzés, és élvezem a filmkészítésről szóló jó filmet.<br/><br/>De Hugo nem elsősorban a filmről szól, annak ellenére, hogy Méli-nek vannak kapcsolatai. Az általad említett témák mellett a célod megtalálásáról is szól, ahogy a karakterek kifejezetten, fáradságosan elmagyarázzák egymásnak és nekünk. És a látványosságról szól, a nagy akciótervekről, az üldözésekről, és a boldog befejezésekről, ahol még a dühös zsarnok és a félénk idősebb pár és a fergawdsakes még a házsártos tacskó is párosodik a bájos szerelmi érdeklődéssel a végén. Arról szól, hogy a szuper drága Hermione Granger-típus főnökösködő, csintalan és okos, és dicséri a könyvekbe zárt varázslatos világokat.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Igen, Scorsese az archetípusokkal játszik. A probléma az, hogy soha nem éreztem, hogy valami új, friss vagy hihető dologgal töltötte el őket, a saját háttértörténete ellenére. Sokkal jobban szerettem volna egy történetet egy asztmával felnövő fiatal Scorsese-ről - valami kis méretű és valódi, hatalmas szobák nélkül, tele CGI óraművel és arany izzó pormotívumokkal és prófétai álmokkal, és egy dühöngő felnőtt zsarnok-őrrel, arany szívvel - mindez túlméretezett, túl a tetején. Továbbra is Scorsese személyes hátterére és a film iránti szeretetére hivatkozol annak bizonyítékaként, hogy tényleg érzi, amit a képernyőre tesz, de nem érzem a személyes érintését, kivéve azokat a pillanatokat, amelyek kifejezetten a filmről szólnak. Lehet, hogy az alapvető érzelmek valósak, de ez nem teszi a végrehajtást kevésbé hamissá.<br/><br/>Azt mondja, az érzelem hitelességét nem lehet tagadni. Nem kérdőjelezem meg, hogy Scorsese gyermekként magányosnak és elszigeteltnek érezte-e magát, de nem érzem a magányt és az elszigeteltséget a képernyőn - látok egy csomó eltúlzott jelzőt (Hugo piszkos és a ruháit viselik, és minden felnőtt kiabál vele, és rendszeresen üldözi egy ijesztő kutya!) és nagy ütemeket, kiabálással és sírással és Spielbergi csoda-emotinggal. Számomra az őszinteség meggyőzőbb és személyesebb, ha csendes és közvetlen; amikor valaki a véleményét kiabálja rám, feltételezem, hogy vagy nagyon dühös, vagy csak megpróbálja túlterhelni az érzékeimet, hogy megakadályozza, hogy kifejezzem a saját véleményemet. Hugo egy hosszú kiáltás volt, ami engem illet.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>- Miért nem kaptam meg Amélie-től a hamisítás érzését? Teljes mértékben elismerem, hogy az Amélie és a Moulin Rouge egyaránt nagy, manipulatív, mesterséges konstrukciók, amelyek pontosan ugyanabban a szellemben, meghatározott időközönként specifikus érzelmeket követelnek, és megpróbálják eladni ezeket az érzelmeket erős érzelmekkel és agresszív hangsávokkal. Egyikük sem árulta el nekem az érzelmeit, mint valódi emberi érzést. Amit élveztem ebben a két filmben, az az építkezés volt - különösen Amélie csintalan, nevetséges listája a véletlenszerű karakterisztikákról és tapasztalatokról a szereposztáshoz, valamint Moulin Rouge zenei-mágikus mashupjai és újrafogalmazásai. Gyakran eladnak olyan történetekért, amelyek kreatív vagy ambiciózus dolgokat hoznak létre, és mindkét film megfelel, ahol Hugo sokkal lineárisabb, szabványos gyerek-quest.<br/><br/>De végül, számomra, tényleg az az érzés, hogy ezek a filmek bolondok, míg Hugo-t komolyan kell venni minden nehéz pillanatban. Nem gondolja, hogy ez igaz - de ezzel egyidejűleg megvédi integritását a teljesen hiteles, gyökerező Scorsese történelmi érzelmei szempontjából, és azt mondja nekem, hogy tévedek, és nem akarja komolyan venni. Mi a helyzet a filmmel, ami azt sugallja, hogy nem kell névértéken venni? És lehetséges, hogy ez csak egy újabb furcsa Benjamin Button-szerű helyzet, ahol a gyerekek használata a nagy költségvetésű filmekben nagyrészt nyálas és melodramatikus, míg te apaként úgy találod, hogy megkerüli a cinizmusodat, és egyenesen a családi érzésedhez megy?<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Scott: Nem biztos, hogy úgy értettem, hogy Scorsese nem azt jelenti, hogy komolyan kell venni; csak egy szeszélyes járművet választott, amelyen keresztül kifejezheti a filmek komoly szeretetét. Amikor azt mondod: "De Hugo elsősorban nem a filmről szól, a Méli's nyakkendői ellenére," meg vagyok zavarodva. Elismerem, hogy Hugo sok elemét túlságosan ismerősnek és fáradságosnak találja, és tele van Spielbergi csoda-emoting - semmit sem tehetek, hogy vitatkozzak az észlelés körül, amelyet más Hugo kételkedők osztanak. Néha egy film azt jelenti, hogy elbűvölsz és elvarázsolsz, de nem mindenkinek; neked ott van Hugo és nekem ott van Amélie, bár úgy gondolom, hogy az utóbbi, bár szándékosan mesterséges, azt jelenti, hogy romantikusnak találjuk. (Ahelyett, hogy mondjuk valami szörnyű mechanikus szerkentyű illene egy Fűrész folytatáshoz.)<br/><br/>De azt mondani, hogy Hugo nem elsősorban a filmről szól? Ha nem a filmről, akkor ez a legértelmetlenebb történet [bármiről is gondolja, hogy ez], amit valaha láttam. A Hugo és Mélies közötti kapcsolat a film szíve, és ennek középpontjában nem csak a Plucky Orphan és a Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold közötti kapcsolat áll, hanem a mesterséges mágia iránti közös affinitás - különösen a filmek varázsa. Úgy gondolom, Scorsese és munkatársai megtalálták a módját, hogy kifejezzék lelkesedésüket a film korai napjaiban egy olyan fantázián keresztül, amely minden korosztály számára elérhető. Az archetípussal töltött gyermekmese a puszta kéreg itt; a mozi a pite. (Mmmm... pite.)<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Ami a Benjamin Button különös esetét illeti, nem látok sok kapcsolatot, azon kívül, hogy Benjamin Button védőként megpróbálok leleplezni, hogy károsítsam a hitelességemet. (Egyébként, hogy vannak a G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray extrái?) Mondtam már neked, hogy a bennem lévő, alváshiányos új apa talán sebezhető volt Benjamin Button számára, de nem tudom elképzelni az időt, amikor a fordított öregedés előfeltétele nem mozdítana meg. És különben is, nem értem, hogy Benjamin Button hogyan viszonyul a Hugóhoz, mint egy gyerekekről szóló filmhez, mivel ez csak egy kis szegmense a történetnek, amely sokkal nagyobb röppályát ölel fel.<br/><br/>Szóval meggyőztelek? Valószínűleg nem. De örülök, hogy megtudtam, hogy Hugo nem volt teljesen mentes a varázslatoktól. A Méli's-en, a filmkészítő jelenetei teszik Hugo-t számomra - és ebben legalább megoszthatunk egy kis filmszeretetet.<br/><br/>Hírlevél<br/><br/>Tasha: Nem, nem mondhatnám, hogy meggyőztél, ahogy én sem győztelek meg. Lehetetlen bárkit is rábeszélni bárminek a zsigeri szeretetére, és ugyanúgy lehetetlen lenne valakit lebeszélni a zsigeri szeretetről. Leginkább azt, hogy láthattam Hugót a Scott-O-Vision-ben, ami egy érdekes élmény; legalábbis most már enyhén meg vagyok győződve arról, hogy valahogy nem sikerült teljesen különböző filmeket látnunk, amelyek valahogy ugyanazt a nevet és rendezőt kapták.<br/><br/>Természetesen különböző tapasztalataink voltak, és szerintem a produkció különböző aspektusaira összpontosítottunk: még mindig nem látom a "film csodálatos" témát, mint a film egyetlen szálát, annyira, mint egy a túl sok közül. A "pontosan diszkurzív" szinte eltakarja, bár a "gyakran szükségtelenül aranyos és értékes" tetejébe. Míg a film finom pite töltelékére összpontosítasz, úgy érzem, hogy a pite egy font kristályos cukorral volt borítva, és azt hiszem, ez különbséget tesz, függetlenül a film alapvető üzenetétől vagy néhány fantasztikus jelenettől. Lásd még Benjamin Buttont, akit nem csak azért hoztam fel, hogy megszégyenítselek - tényleg úgy gondolom, hogy sokkal érzelgősebb vagy, mint én a moziban lévő gyerekekkel kapcsolatban, különösen akkor, ha inkább a sebezhetőség és az ártatlanság szimbólumaként használják őket, mint emberi karakterekként. Hé, tudod, melyik filmben nincsenek aranyos, széles szemű moppetek, amelyek reményt hoznak egy cinikus világba? G.I. Joe: A Cobra felemelkedése. Talán megnézem azokat a Blu-ray extrákat. Használhatnék egy robbanás-inzulint, hogy kompenzáljam Hugo édességét. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Reméltem, hogy a lányom megszabadul a nehéz és zavaró időktől" - Mee Mee története menekült anyaként<br/><br/>Remény válság idején: Anyák napi történet<br/><br/>Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee hallotta, hogy jönnek a katonák. Megragadta a fiát, és kétségbeesetten csatlakozott a többi falusihoz, akik a thai-burmai határ felé futottak, ahol az ENSZ Menekültügyi Főbiztossága (UNHCR) található. Férje egy másik, ellenkező irányba futó faluban volt, Mee később megtudta. Miután a katonák üldözése véget ért, Mee hazatért kis falujába, a burmai Koechibe.<br/><br/>1997 és 2000 között Mee és hozzá hasonló ezrek éltek a burmai katonák állandó fenyegetése alatt. Sok ember ideiglenes menedéket a dzsungelben, és hazatérnek a falujukba, miután a katonák elhagyták a területet, csak azért, hogy napokkal később újra megtegyék. Hetente egyszer Mee és mások elindulnak, hogy elkerüljék a katonák általi elfogást, nemi erőszakot vagy halált.<br/><br/>Egy incidens során Mee férje a felesége elé futott, hogy élelmet szerezzen a családjának. A férjét katonák észrevették és lelőtték. A golyó szétzúzta bordázatának egy részét, így súlyosan megsebesült és bajba került, miközben családjával a dzsungel felé utazott a biztonság érdekében.<br/><br/>Három hónapig Mee férje bújt el és vitte el a családot egy elkeserítő sebbel az oldalán, nem kapott orvosi ellátást, kivéve Mee gondozását.<br/><br/>- Féltem visszatérni Burmába - mondta Mee tolmácson keresztül. - Féltem a haláltól. Minden nap sírtam és sírtam - folytatta.<br/><br/>Mee férje végül elég erőt merített ahhoz, hogy öt napot gyalogoljon egy kis thaiföldi falu felé, ahol megtudták egy kórház és egy menekülttábor helyét. Amikor Mee és férje végül megérkeztek a kórházba, azonnali műtéten esett át, majd később felépült.<br/><br/>A remény szimbóluma<br/><br/>Az élet a dzsungelben azok számára, akik menekülnek a burmai katonák valóban félelmetes és nehéz volt. Azonnal bambusz sátrak csak tető és padlóburkolatok lett alkalmas ideiglenes lakások. Sok nő, köztük Mee szült a gyermekek a dzsungelben. Mee akkor hatéves fia segédkezett Eh Ku Hser nevű húgának szállításában. Nevének jelentése szerelem – hideg – édes. A "hideg" a burmai kultúrában azt jelenti, hogy ne menjen át az élet tüzén, mivel a hőség a zavaros időket jelképezi.<br/><br/>"Reméltem, hogy a lányom megszabadul a nehéz és nyugtalanító időktől" - mondta Mee. - "Nem akartam, hogy átélje azt, amit átéltem" - folytatta.<br/><br/>Mee számára lánya születése a sötétség, a gyötrelem és a félelem közepette az eljövendő új élet reményének szimbóluma volt.

Ott Mee találkozott Moo Kho Paw-val, egy másik nővel, aki Burmából emigrált, és aki a jóléti gyertyán dolgozott Firenzében. A szervezet segít a menekült nőknek, akik elmenekültek a konfliktusos területekről, hogy újjáépítsék életüket a gyertyakészítés művészetével. Moo Kho javasolta, hogy Mee csatlakozzon a szervezethez, és Mee örömmel elfogadta.<br/><br/>"Izgatott voltam, hogy elhagyhatom a házat" - mondta Mee -, "annak a hitére neveltek, hogy mivel nő vagyok, az én szerepem az volt, hogy otthon maradjak, és felneveljem a családomat." "Bár sok burmai nő többet akar tenni önmagáért, gyakran arra ösztönzik őket, hogy maradjanak háztartásbeliek."<br/><br/>Ma Mee azt tervezi, hogy bemegy a gyertyakészítő üzletbe magának, és támogatja öt gyermekét, de kifejezte annak szükségességét, hogy először angolul tanuljon.<br/><br/>"A thai menekülttáborban volt oktatás, de nem volt olyan jó" - mondta Mee. - Gyerekkoromban iskolába akartam menni, de azt mondták, hogy maradjak otthon, mert nő vagyok. Most azt remélem, hogy a lányaim egyetemre mennek, és orvosok vagy rendőrnők lesznek" - folytatta Mee.<br/><br/>Mee egyensúlyba hozta az életét, amit bárcsak mások találtak volna meg - egy egyszerű, boldog életet, ahol a munkának, a családtagok gondozásának és a választás szabadságának mind megvan a helye.<br/><br/>Menekült nők támogatása az USA-ban<br/><br/>Ossza meg ezt az anyák napi történetet szeretteivel. És amikor kézzel készített gyertyákat vásárol Mee, Moo Kho és Naw, egy másik burmai menekült nő, aki a Prosperity Candle-nél dolgozik, tudják, hogy segítenek fenntartani a megélhetésüket, miközben újjáépítik az életüket és családtagjaik életét az Egyesült Államokban. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

At the end of the prologue Bradstreet writes, "Let Greeks be Greeks, and woman what they are; Men have precedency and still excel, It is but vain unjustly to wage war; Men can do best, and women know it well."<br/>Bradstreet's tone seems to be sincere, but a hint of humor and sarcasm also lurks between the verses. This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | A precedencia-esszé<br/><br/>1562 szó - 7 oldal<br/><br/>A határozott fellépés olyan kormányzati politika, amely lehetőséget ad a kisebbségeknek, a nőknek és minden olyan csoportnak, akik a múltban hátrányos megkülönböztetésnek estek áldozatul. A határozott fellépés az 1960-as polgárjogi mozgalom eredménye, amely az 1964-es polgári jogi törvényből nőtt ki, amely tiltotta a faji, etnikai vagy nemi alapú megkülönböztetést. Ez volt a Legfelsőbb Bíróság 1978-as döntése, a The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, amely lehetővé tette a faji preferenciák használatát a sokszínűség elősegítésére, lehetővé téve a pozitív diszkrimináció alkalmazását a felvételi politikákban. Azzal a szándékkal jött létre, hogy egyenlő esélyeket biztosítson a kisebbségi csoportok tagjai számára az oktatásban és ... tekintse meg a dokumentum közepén ...<br/><br/>A Pew Research Center 2007-es jelentése szerint azonban az amerikai közvélemény pozitív diszkriminációjának támogatottsága jelentősen megnőtt az elmúlt években, az 1995-ös 58 százalékról 2007-re 70 százalékra emelkedett. A pozitív diszkrimináció támogatói számos érvet hoznak fel a pozitív diszkrimináció mellett, abban a reményben, hogy másokkal is megismertetik azt a valódi jót, amit a pozitív diszkriminációs politika hoz a társadalmunkra. A támogatók úgy vélik, hogy a pozitív diszkrimináció inkább egy folyamat, mint egy felvételi politika. A főiskolák és egyetemek extra kezdeményezést tesznek, hogy elérjék a kisebbségi csoportokat, ösztönözve őket a jelentkezésre. A főiskolák és egyetemek további pénzügyi támogatást nyújtanak, és egyetemi forrásokat biztosítanak a hallgató főiskolai oktatásának javításához. A támogatók azt is megjegyzik, hogy a főiskolákra és egyetemekre irányuló kisebbségi kérelmek száma növekszik, részben a pozitív diszkriminációs politikák miatt.<br/>A statisztikák bebizonyították, hogy amikor a pozitív diszkrimináció megszűnik, például 1998-ban a Berkley College-ban és az UCLA-ban, a kisebbségi hallgatói felvételi 61% -kal és 36% -kal csökkent, bizonyítva, hogy a pozitív diszkrimináció jelentős szerepet játszik a kisebbségi hallgatók főiskolai felvételi folyamatában. A támogatók úgy vélik, hogy a felsőoktatás sokszínűsége jobb oktatási légkört biztosít minden diák számára, személyesen és szellemileg. Ha a pozitív diszkrimináció megszűnne, kevesebb kisebbségi diák iratkozna be a főiskolákra, ami a sokszínűséget meglehetősen csekély mértékűvé tenné. A faji, gazdasági és társadalmi elnyomás évszázadainak kompenzálása érdekében határozott cselekvési politikákra is szükség van. A magasabb társadalmi-gazdasági helyzetű egyéneknek több lehetőségük van, mint az alacsonyabb társadalmi-gazdasági háttérrel rendelkezőknek. A támogatók úgy vélik, hogy bizonyos faji vagy etnikai csoportok hátrányos helyzetben vannak, mivel gyakran alacsonyabb jövedelmű háztartásokban élnek, és ezért nincsenek kitéve ugyanazoknak a forrásoknak, mint a magasabb társadalmi-gazdasági osztályok diákjai. Az ügyvédek támogatják a diákok közötti érdemeken alapuló verseny fogalmát, de azzal érvelnek, hogy a pozitív diszkrimináció kompenzálja a gazdasági különbségeket. A főiskolai végzettséggel rendelkezők, akik a pozitív diszkrimináció előnyeit élvezték, azt is elmondták, hogy jobb munkát kaptak, több pénzt kerestek, és összességében jobb életet élnek a pozitív diszkrimináció révén kapott szerencsés lehetőségek miatt.<br/>A pozitív diszkrimináció támogatói folyamatosan hangsúlyozzák a pozitív diszkrimináció súlyos fontosságát, figyelembe véve annak hozzájárulását mind a főiskolai tapasztalatok, mind a társadalom általános fejlődéséhez. A pozitív diszkrimináció ellenzői azonban úgy vélik, hogy eljött az ideje, hogy véget vessünk a pozitív diszkriminációnak. Az ellenzők úgy vélik, hogy a pozitív diszkriminációt azért hozták létre, hogy biztosítsák a tisztességes befogadási gyakorlatokat, hogy megváltoztassák a faji megkülönböztetés hosszú időszakát. Úgy vélik, hogy a politika elavult."

Bradstreet számára az ellenszegülés témája elfogadható, amikor a mindennapi élet valósága elleni fizikai beszéd kritikájáról van szó, de nem elfogadható, hogy a spirituálisra vonatkozzon.

| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Születésnapok<br/><br/>Előfordulhat, hogy a szervezet néhány tagja nem kívánja megadni a születési dátumát. Az Infoodle lehetővé teszi, hogy eltávolítsa egy személy születési évét! Ehhez:<br/><br/>Személy hozzáadásakor kattintson az Év elrejtése gombra az adott személy születési évének eltávolításához.<br/><br/>Alternatív megoldásként, amikor egy személy szerkesztése megtalálja a webhely születési dátumát. Kattintson a Szerkesztés gombra, majd kattintson az év elrejtése és mentése gombra.<br/><br/>Ilyen egyszerű!<br/><br/>Megjegyzés: Az a személy, akinek születési évét eltávolítják, nem jelenik meg semmilyen jelentésben az életkori kritériumokról, és felnőttként osztályozzák, mert születési dátumuk valójában 1902-re van állítva! A születési dátum általában az információs részben található, de lehet, hogy az adminisztrátor egy másik lapon helyezte át. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinációk<br/><br/>Kombinációk Védekezés ütés ellen, koreografált válaszok különböző típusú támadásokra. Sok nevük van a harcművészetekben, de (tapasztalatom szerint) minden művészetnek van egy változata. Ez teszi őket mássá, mint a formákat, mert rengeteg olyan harcművészet van, amelynek nincs formája. Mi teszi a partnergyakorlatokat annyira egyetemessé? Miért gyakoroljunk egy konkrét választ, amikor (valójában) az időzítés, a támadás típusa, a támadó mérete és még száz más tényező miatt soha nem használjuk ezt a teljes koreografált választ? És végül, hogyan lehet gyakorolni egy igazi védelmi helyzetet, és elkerülni a sérüléseket egyszerre?<br/><br/>A kombinációk egyetemessége enyhén szólva lenyűgöző. A Kenpo karate stílusa 108 kombinációt tartalmaz, amelyeket meg lehet tanulni. (A legtöbb diák csak 20-30-at tanul) A brazil Jiu-Jitsu-ban egész osztályokat tölt a karok és a fojtások gyakorlásával, megtanulva minden finomságot a mozgáshoz, miközben a partnere kevés vagy semmilyen ellenállást nem kínál. Minden bokszoló órákat töltött a táska és / vagy a tükör előtt, ugyanazt az ütéskombinációt dobva, amíg a testük egyedül nem mozog. A kombinációk univerzálisak, mert nincs jobb módja a mozgás bevezetésének, majd a finom pozíciók gyakorlásának. Egy kis nyomáspont megütése a ruházaton keresztül sok gyakorlatot igényel, a karrúd megragadása ellenőrzéssel gondosan elhelyezett csípőt és alattomos beállítást igényel, és egy nagyszerű kombináció csak akkor hasznos, ha kiegyensúlyozott és védett pozícióból lehet átmenni. El tudsz képzelni jobb módot arra, hogy megszerezd ezeket a képességeket?<br/><br/>Számos olyan tényező van, amely meghatározza, hogyan reagálsz egy támadásra, és hogy egy edzőmérkőzésen vagy egy harcban soha nem használtam teljes kombinációt a védelmemben. Akkor miért töltünk órákat a gyakorlásukkal? Gyakoroljuk ezeket a koreografált válaszokat, mert a cél nem az, hogy a 8-as kombinációt minden alkalommal kihúzzuk, amikor egy horog ütést látunk, hanem hogy megmutassuk az egyik módját annak blokkolására, majd egy lehetséges módja annak nyomon követésére. Soha nem választottam a 3-as kombinációt valósághelyzetben, de a blokk az egyik lépésem. A kombinációk eszközöket adnak az eszköztárhoz, nem javítják meg az autót.<br/><br/>Az utolsó kérdés a biztonság kérdése. Ha a valóság kedvéért gyakorolunk, meg kell ismételni a valóságot. Hogyan előzzük meg a sérüléseket? Amikor a bizalomról van szó. Lassan kezdjük, és megtanuljuk bízni abban, hogy mi irányítjuk magunkat. Megtanuljuk, hogy bízzunk partnereink irányításában is. Több idő alatt megtanuljuk bízni a partnerünk irányításában, és (egy kicsit ijesztőbb) megtanuljuk bízni partnerünk irányításában. A végén (sok gyakorlással) teljes sebességgel mozoghatsz, eldobhatod a partneredet, és a sérüléstől való félelem nélkül dobhatsz.<br/><br/>A kombinációk okkal univerzálisak; gyakorolják őket, így felboncolhatók a részeikre, és biztonságban maradunk a lassú indítással és a bizalom építésével. Mint minden más a harcművészetekben, a kombinációknak számos oka van a gyakorlásuk és a végrehajtásuk mögött. |
