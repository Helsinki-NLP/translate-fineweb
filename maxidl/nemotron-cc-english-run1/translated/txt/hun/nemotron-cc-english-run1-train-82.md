In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR tanúsítási blog<br/><br/>Időpont: 2014. július 23.<br/><br/>Az autoszomális domináns interstitialis vesebetegség a vese ismert funkcióit érintő betegségek ritka gyűjteménye.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Locke beszámolója a természet állapotáról<br/><br/>Téma: FilozófiaSzavak: 2539Oldalszám: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes és Locke a legbefolyásosabb politikai filozófusok közé tartoznak, akik valaha angolul írtak. A természet állapota, amely megelőzi a komplex társadalmak szerveződését, az a közös előfeltevés, amelyet Hobbes és Locke is megoszt, de különbözőképpen értelmez. Az előbbiek az embereket természetes állapotukban egyformán veszélyesnek és szabadnak tartják, hogy önző céljaikat az igazságosság nem létező fogalmai által nem korlátozva követhessék, ezért az ő természetes állapota egyenlő "minden ember háborújával minden ember ellen" (Hobbes76). Ez utóbbi viszont az embereket eredeti állapotukban egyformán értékesnek tekinti, és korlátozza a természetes szabadságot az igazságosság eszméjével, amely megköveteli, hogy ne ártsanak másoknak, ami lehetővé teszi a természet állapotának meghatározását, mint "kölcsönös segítséget és megőrzést" a háború helyett (Locke 15). A fő különbség a két filozófus természetes állapotról szóló beszámolói között az, hogy Locke etikai megfontolásokat használ, míg Hobbes nem, és végső soron Hobbes egy olyan államot képzel el, amely korlátlan hatalmat gyakorol az emberek felett, míg Locke korlátozza a kormányt az erkölcsi elvekkel, amelyeket természetes törvénynek tekint.<br/><br/>Hobbes a természet állapotára vonatkozó feltételezéseit arra a tényre alapozza, hogy minden ember nagyjából egyenlő fizikai és mentális képességeiben. Elismeri, hogy egyesek nagyobb fizikai erőt vagy felsőbbrendű értelmet mutatnak, de ragaszkodik ahhoz, hogy "amikor mindent egybeszámítanak, az ember és az ember közötti különbség nem olyan jelentős" (Hobbes 74). Mivel az emberek képességeikben nagyjából egyenlőek, hasonló reményeik vannak arra is, hogy elérjék céljaikat és kielégítsék szükségleteiket (Hobbes 75). Ennek az egyenlőségnek logikus következményeként, amikor az emberek elkezdenek versengeni a szűkös erőforrásokért, senki sem érezheti magát teljesen biztonságban a vagyonában. Még ha egy hatalmas, ravasz és hozzáértő személynek sikerül is leigáznia "minden ember személyét, akit csak tud", ez még mindig nem garantálja a végső biztonságot (Hobbes 75). Mivel egyetlen ember sem képes olyan fölényt elérni a többiekkel szemben, amely teljes mértékben immunissá teszi őt értelmi képességeivel szemben, egyetlen ember sem érezheti magát teljesen biztonságban, ha egyenrangú társai veszik körül. Hobbes egyenjogúsága a természetes állapotban a félelem egyenjogúsága, ahol minden ember veszélyes vetélytársnak tekinti egymást.<br/><br/>Csakúgy, mint Hobbes, Locke minden emberi lényt alapvetően egyenlőnek tekint, de nagyon eltérő jelentést tulajdonít a kifejezésnek. Az ő szemszögéből ez nem a képességek egyenlősége, hanem inkább az érték egyenlősége. Úgy véli, hogy a "természet minden előnyére született" embereknek logikusan élvezniük kell a tökéletes egyenlőséget közöttük, mivel nincs ok arra, hogy bárkit is értékesebbnek tekintsünk (Locke 8). Az egyetlen lehetséges alap arra, hogy egyes embereket mások fölé helyezzünk, az lenne, ha Isten "akaratának bármely nyilvánvaló kijelentésével egymás fölé helyezné őket" (Locke 8). Mivel a felsőbbrendűség ilyen isteni szentesítése hiányzik, Locke arra a következtetésre jut, hogy az emberiség minden képviselőjének természetes egyenlősége nem kérdőjelezhető meg. Hobbes pragmatikusan közelíti meg az egyenlőséget, és hangsúlyozza, hogy az emberek a természetes állapotukban ugyanolyan veszélyesek, de Locke etikai megközelítést alkalmaz, és hangsúlyozza, hogy az emberek egyformán értékesek Isten szemében. Ez a nézeteltérés csak az első különbség a két szerző között, azon a tényen alapulva, hogy Locke premisszaként foglalja bele Istent politikai filozófiájába, míg Hobbes nem.<br/><br/>Hobbes természeti állapotról szóló beszámolójának másik jellemzője a szabadság értelmezése. Hobbes szerint a természet állapota korlátlan szabadságot jelent, hogy bármit megtehessen, ami az ember folyamatos létezéséhez szükséges. A filozófus a szabadságot úgy határozza meg, mint "a külső akadályok hiányát" abban, hogy valaki a képességeit a céljai elérésére használja (Hobbes 79). Minden érző lény elsődleges célja a folyamatos létezés fenntartása. Ennek következtében a Hobbes-féle szabadság akadálytalan lehetőség arra, hogy bármit megtegyünk, ami megítélésünk szerint a legalkalmasabb az ember életének és javainak megőrzésére (Hobbes 79). A szabadság egyetlen korlátja az, hogy az ember nem tehet semmi olyat, ami ellentmondana életének fenntartásában, vagy megsemmisítené "annak megőrzésének eszközeit" (Hobbes 79). Ettől eltekintve nincsenek határok, és mindenkinek "joga van mindenhez, még egymás testéhez is", ha ez elősegíti az ember túlélését (Hobbes 80). Így a természetes szabadság, Hobbes nézete szerint, a külsőleg kikényszerített akadályok hiánya a mindenhez való jog érvényesítésében, hogy fenntartsa és biztosítsa az ember folyamatos létezését.<br/><br/>Locke szintén támogatja a természetes szabadság eszméjét, de nem meglepő módon Hobbes-tól jelentősen eltérő módon közelíti meg. Amint elkezdi megvitatni a szabadságot a természet állapotában, azonnal megjegyzi, hogy a szabadság állapota nem egyenlő a "engedély állapotával" (Locke 9). A filozófus az emberi szabadság két konkrét korlátját azonosítja a természet állapotában. Az első megegyezik Hobbes bevezetőjével: bár szabad és független, az embernek "nincs szabadsága elpusztítani magát" (Locke 9). A második korlátozás azonban közvetlenül ellentmond Hobbes prepozícióinak. Locke szerint minden emberi lénynek természetes kötelessége, hogy "életében, egészségében, szabadságában vagy vagyonában ne ártson senkinek" (9). Csakúgy, mint az egyenlőség értelmezésében, a szerző ezt az állítást etikai és vallási alapokra alapozza: az embereknek meg kell őrizniük egymás létezését, mivel mindannyian ugyanannak a "mindenható és végtelenül bölcs alkotónak" a teremtményei. Locke tehát sokkal szigorúbban korlátozza a szabadságot természetes állapotában, mint Hobbes, azáltal, hogy bevezeti azt a kötelezettséget, hogy tartózkodjon mind a saját, mind a többiek károsításától.<br/><br/>A két szerző közötti különbségek az igazságosságról szóló beszámolóikban is megnyilvánulnak az emberiség természetes állapotában. Hobbes számára az igazságos és igazságtalan gyakorlatok felvázolása pusztán a törvény kérdése. A természet állapotában nincs ítélkezés, és az egyetlen törvény, amely az embereket eredeti állapotukban irányítja, egy természeti törvény, amely csak arra kötelezi őket, hogy személyes biztonságra törekedjenek. Ennek következtében semmi sem lehet igazságtalan az emberiség eredeti állapotában: a "helyes és helytelen igazságosság és igazságtalanság megjegyzéseinek" nincs helye és nincs értelme a szigorúan érvényesített törvény hiányában (Hobbes 78). Mindaddig, amíg az emberek gyakorlatilag korlátlan szabadságukkal könyörtelenül versengenek egymással az erőforrásokért, amelyekhez egyformán joguk van, nincs kritériumuk arra, hogy különbséget tegyenek az igazságos és az igazságtalan cselekedetek között. Ezért a Hobbes-féle természeti állapot dacol magának az igazságszolgáltatásnak az ideájával, mivel a szerző azt a formalizált és bevett törvény puszta funkciójaként értelmezi.<br/><br/>Locke más jelentést tulajdonít az igazságszolgáltatásnak, és nem annyira a törvényhozásban, mint inkább az etikai értelemben tekint rá. Ez a tanulmány már említette, hogy Hobbes-szal ellentétben Locke etikai fogalmakat alkalmaz, és politikai filozófiáját általában erkölcsi, nem pedig tisztán gyakorlati feltételezésekre alapozza. Locke természeti törvénye, ellentétben Hobbes törvényével, arra kötelezi az embereket, hogy gondoskodjanak egymásról, ahelyett, hogy egyszerűen csak magukra hagynának mindenkit. Ennek eredményeként van helye az igazságosságnak és az igazságtalanságnak a természeti állapotában. A szerző maga is rámutat erre a tényre, amikor megjegyzi, hogy senki sem foszthatja meg a másikat az életétől a megőrzésének eszközeitől, "kivéve, ha igazságot szolgáltat egy elkövetőnek" (Locke 9). Ez a kijelentés a lehető legvilágosabban feltárja, hogy Locke szerint a természet állapotában igazság van, és ráadásul az embereknek aktívan meg kell őrizniük. Az igazságosság kritériuma, ami Hobbes természetes állapotából hiányzik, a Locke által kiszabott második korlátozás a természetes szabadságra: egy cselekedet igazságtalan, ha indokolatlan fenyegetést jelent egy másik személy életére és vagyonára.<br/><br/>A két szerző egyenlőségről, szabadságról, igazságosságról vagy igazságtalanságról alkotott felfogásában mutatkozó különbségek a természeti állapot és a hadiállapot viszonyának értelmezésében csúcsosodnak ki. Hobbes szemszögéből a kettő szinonima, mert a könyörtelen verseny az egyetlen logikus eredménye annak, hogy az azonos képességekkel és hasonló igényekkel rendelkező embereket korlátozott erőforrásokkal rendelkező környezetbe helyezzük. Kijelenti ezt a közvetlen összefüggést: "Ha két ember ugyanazt akarja, amit nem tudnak mindketten élvezni, akkor ellenségekké válnak" (Hobbes 75). Mégis, mivel az emberek számosak, és mindannyian hasonló képességekkel és szükségletekkel rendelkeznek, ez a verseny nemcsak az egyéni interakciókban nyilvánul meg, hanem az egész emberiség szintjén is. Mindaddig, amíg minden embernek egyenlő és korlátlan joga van minden erőforráshoz, még egymás testéhez és életéhez is, a természet állapota "minden ember háborúja minden ember ellen" (Hobbes 76). Ez a komor értelmezés közvetlenül Hobbesnak a természet állapotáról szóló ábrázolásából ered, amelyet kizárólag az egyének egoista késztetései irányítanak.<br/><br/>Locke viszont különbséget tesz a természet állapota és a háború állapota között, és rámutat, hogy bár ezek egyidejűleg is előfordulhatnak, nem ok arra, hogy egyiket a másikkal azonosítsuk. Locke hadiállapot-definíciója gyakorlatilag megegyezik Hobbes definíciójával. Locke szerint "aki megpróbál egy másik embert abszolút hatalmába keríteni, ezzel hadiállapotba helyezi magát vele" (14). Ez a magyarázat tökéletesen megfelel annak a hobbesi elképzelésnek, hogy mindenki egyetemes joga mindenhez, beleértve a többi ember testét és életét is, a háború állapotához vezet. Locke mégsem hajlandó egyenlőségjelet tenni a hadiállapot és a természeti állapot közé pontosan azért, mert tagadja Hobbes értelmezését a természetes szabadságról. Mivel Locke természetes állapota visszatartja az embereket attól, hogy ártsanak egymásnak a szabadság második korlátozása révén, a másik személy szabadságának megkísérlése a természeti törvény megszegése. Míg Hobbes számára a háború az emberiség alapállapota, Locke a természet állapotának elferdítéseként tünteti fel, nem pedig uralmának.<br/><br/>Ezek a különbségek, amelyek az államot a természetről és annak összetevőiről, például a szabadságról, az egyenlőségről, az igazságosságról és a háborúról határozzák meg, előkészítik az utat a szerzők számára, akik ellentétes képet festenek a kormányról. A természet állapotáról szóló pesszimista értékelése alapján a Leviathan szerzője arra a következtetésre jut, hogy háborús körülmények között nincs határozott remény arra, hogy "megéljük azt az időt, amelyet a természet általában megenged az embereknek" (Hobbes 80). A megoldás az, hogy lefektetjük az egyetemes jogot mindenhez, és mindenkire annyi szabadságot hagyunk a többi emberrel szemben, amennyit ő megengedne másoknak saját magával szemben (Hobbes 80). Az ebből eredő társadalmi szerződés résztvevői az általuk átadott korlátlan szabadságjogokat egy szuverénbe fektetik – a legfőbb hatalom hordozójába, akinek az a célja, hogy az elért status quót az ellene elkövetett minden vétség büntetésével megőrizze. A szuverén hatalma abszolút: az uralkodónak joga van "mindent megtenni, amit szükségesnek tart", hogy előmozdítsa az alattvalói közötti békét, hogy senki ne támadja meg a másik életét vagy tulajdonát. Hobbes arra a következtetésre jut, hogy egy ilyen megtámadhatatlan alak nélkül, akinek joga van bármit is tenni az alattvalókkal, nem lehet béke és a biztonság garanciája.<br/><br/>Míg Locke egyetért a politikailag szervezett társadalmak létrehozásának szükségességével, mindazonáltal ellenzi Hobbes elképzelését a szuverén hatalomról, mint korlátlan és megtámadhatatlan. Mint már említettük, Locke természeti állapota közel sem olyan szörnyű, mint Hobbes által festett, mert az embereknek nemcsak magukat, hanem egymást is meg kell őrizniük. Ezért a társadalmi szerződés szükségessége nem a többiek félelméből származik, hanem a puszta kényelemből. A kis közösségeknek nem kell számos törvény a konfliktusok megoldására és a "tisztek a folyamat felügyeletére", de a nagyobb egyesületek célszerűnek tartják, hogy kormányokat hozzanak létre erre a célra (Locke 57). Mégis, a kormány hatalma nem lehet korlátlan, mert ez azt eredményezné, hogy az alattvalókat "egy másik ember állandó, bizonytalan, ismeretlen, önkényes akaratának" alárendelné (Locke 17). Egy ilyen kormány a természeti törvény kettős megsértését jelentené. Azáltal, hogy beleegyezik egy másik személy életének abszolút hatalmába, az alany megsérti annak első korlátozását, amely megtiltja, hogy ártson magának. Ami az uralkodót illeti, egy másik személy szabadságának megsemmisítése közvetlen kárt okozna, és mint ilyen, ellentétes lenne a második korlátozással.<br/><br/>Hobbes a korlátlan kormányzati hatalom melletti érvének egyenes folytatásaként elvi alapon tagadja a hatalmi ágak szétválasztását. Az ő szemszögéből nézve az uralkodó, ha egyszer megalapítják, rendelkezik "a szabályok előírásának teljes hatalmával", vagyis rövidebben a törvényhozó hatalommal (Hobbes 114). Az uralkodó fenntartja magának azt a jogot is, hogy "minden vitát meghallgasson és eldöntsön" - azaz a bírói hatalmat (Hobbes 114). Végül, mivel az uralkodónak az a célja, hogy az alattvalókat arra kényszerítse, hogy ne ártsanak egymásnak, nem lehet kétség afelől, hogy a végrehajtó hatalom az ő kizárólagos előjoga is. A hatalmak mint fogalom szétválasztása Hobbes számára a természet állapotáról vallott nézetei miatt idegen. Egy olyan politikai entitás létrehozása, ahol a végrehajtó, a törvényhozó és az igazságügyi ágak ellenőrzik egymást - azaz versenyeznek - azt jelentené, hogy magasabb szinten újrateremtik a Hobbes-i háborút. Mivel az emberek társadalmi szerződést kötnek, és kormányt alapítanak, hogy a természet állapotát maguk mögött hagyják, nem pedig más formában visszahelyezik, a hatalmi ágak szétválasztása közvetlenül ellentmond Hobbes nézeteinek.<br/><br/>Locke ezzel szemben politikai elméletének megalapozó elveként a hatalom szétválasztását fogadja el. Az elválasztás melletti érve a törvényhozó hatalom korlátainak tárgyalásában nyilvánul meg. Locke megfogalmazása szerint aligha lenne tanácsos, hogy "ugyanazok a személyek, akiknek hatalmuk van a törvények megalkotására, kezükben legyenek a végrehajtásukhoz szükséges hatalommal is" (76). A filozófus rámutat az emberi természet tökéletlenségeire és arra a benne rejlő vágyra, hogy "megragadja a hatalmat", mint ennek az elővigyázatossági intézkedésnek az alapja (Locke 76). Csakúgy, mint Hobbes esetében, Locke beszámolója a hatalmi ágak szétválasztásáról közvetlenül a természet állapotának értelmezéséből ered. Ha már van igazság a természet állapotában, és az emberek megértik azt, akkor minden kormány elkerülhetetlenül alá van vetve ugyanannak a természeti törvénynek. Mivel az emberek feletti abszolút hatalom megsérti e törvény mindkét korlátját, a szétválasztás és a terjesztés tanácsos, hogy a kormány megfelelően működjön.<br/><br/>Ez a tanulmány bebizonyította, hogy míg Hobbes és Locke beszámolói között számos különbség van az emberiség természetes állapotáról, végső soron az erkölcsi előfeltételek hiányának jelenléte. Hobbes úgy tekint a természeti állapotra, mint a korlátlan szabadság állapotára, ahol az emberek egyenlő képességekkel rendelkeznek, és nem kötik őket semmiféle erkölcsi elképzelések, mint például az igazságosság, szüntelenül versenyeznek az erőforrásokért. Locke azonban inkább etikusan értelmezi az egyenlőséget és a szabadságot, mint gyakorlatilag, és azt állítja, hogy a háború a természeti állapot elferdítése, mivel a természeti törvény arra kötelezi az embereket, hogy ne ártsanak egymásnak. Ez a nézeteltérés befolyásolja a filozófusok hozzáállását a kormányzáshoz. Hobbes ragaszkodik egy mindenható uralkodóhoz, mivel etikai korlátozások hiányában egyetlen más hatóság sem kényszerítheti az embereket arra, hogy ne ártsanak egymásnak. Locke nézete szerint azonban a korlátlan hatalom megadása ellentétes lenne a természet törvényébe ágyazott etikai korlátokkal, ezért Hobbes-szal ellentétben a hatalmi ágak szétválasztását támogatja. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Milyen Trónok harca hányt<br/><br/>A kanadai-francia énekes Abbas Hasan tett vakító erőfeszítést, hogy felülmúlja az egész emberiséget a Fashion Parade 2014-en. Semmi baj ezzel, kivéve a biztonság elsőbbséget élvez, és a zenész itt egészségügyi veszélyt jelent.<br/><br/>Azt kapjuk, hogy sztár akar lenni. Sajnos nem kapta meg a feljegyzést, ahol elmondják a kétségbeesetteknek és a hírhedteknek, hogy a sztárság egy metafora. Nem kell úgy kinéznie, és szó szerint lángra lobbantani a látásunkat. Továbbá az All Pakistan Aunty Association hivatalosan panaszt nyújtott be ellene. A helyi piac kiszáradt a hamis kristályoktól és a flitteres szörnyűségektől. Nincs mit viselniük a kéthetente magas teákhoz, és azt állítják, hogy ő a hibás. Úgy tűnik, hogy a ruhát a Trónok harca ihlette. Tudna-e ragaszkodni ahhoz, hogy szomorú dalokat írjon a szomszédja halott kutyájáról, ahelyett, hogy kitalálná a ruhákat? Vagy talán a kutya elvesztésének traumája, akinek halála nyilvánvalóan nem ért véget, mivel még mindig viseli a tetemét.<br/><br/>A töltési lap Outfit<br/><br/>Senki sem tudja eldönteni, hol kezdődik a ruha és hol végződik Abbas. Bámulsz, mély szakadékba süllyedsz, és csodálkozol, miért visel bőrnadrágot. Kinek a lovát ölte meg, hogy ellopja a vállán áthúzott nyerget? A vörös szőnyeg megjelenése előtt börtönben volt, és elfelejtette levenni a láncokat? Hogyan fogja túlélni a szintetikus bőrt és a poszt-szekvenciás kiütést, amely ilyen nagy dózisban halálos lehet? Miért vagyok még mindig életben?<br/><br/>Ötlet<br/><br/>Inspirációja látszólag a Trónok harca volt, de végül úgy nézett ki, mintha egy viking étteremből dobták volna ki. Ha találkozott volna a sorozat bármelyik karakterével, az első epizód első öt másodpercében megölték volna.<br/><br/>A mentális egészség vagy annak hiánya: Valaki kap neki, hogy egy tanácsadó ASAP! Úgy tűnik, hogy a feltételezés, hogy rajta egy halott kutya azt jelenti, hogy az egyetlen barátja volt az életében még életben van. Kedves Abbas:<br/><br/>1. A tagadás nem folyó Egyiptomban<br/><br/>2. A megkínzott psziché nem segít a zenében, ezért kérjen segítséget<br/><br/>3. Próbáld ki a képzeletbeli barátokat<br/><br/>Lelépni!<br/><br/>Mindannyian a Fashion Police főhadiszállásán súlyosan traumatizáltak. Abbas olyan valaki, akit nem élveztük a letartóztatást. Jelenleg őrizetben van, és megpróbál bosszút állni más fantasy műsorokból. Csak csillámolta magát, hogy úgy nézzen ki, mint Edward Cullen az Alkonyatból. Közszolgálati üzenetként és a további idegösszeomlások megelőzése érdekében a következő példákat adtuk neki az ugyanazon esemény vörös szőnyegéről származó férfiakról.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Ha kétségei vannak, játsszon biztonságosan. Az énekes úgy néz ki, mint egy átlagos nagybácsi egy shaadi-ban. Egy sima fekete öltöny, kiegészítők nélkül, még akkor is, ha ez egy kicsit aránytalan, működőképes. Zohaib kinézete beleolvad mindenbe és semmibe, és ha nincs divatérzéke vagy pénze, hogy stylistot béreljen, ez rendben van. Nem hordozza a szívmegállás kockázatát a résztvevők számára egy eseményen. Abbász kényes elmeállapotát figyelembe véve, ez a tekintet az, amire törekednie kell.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Egy nap, több évtizedes terápia után, Abbas arra törekedhetett, hogy viseljen ruhát, mint Ali Zafar. A dapper nyári megjelenés közel tökéletes. Ali nagyon közel állt ahhoz, hogy úgy nézzen ki, mint egy főpincér egy francia étteremben a fehér nyári kabátjával, fekete hajtókával, de az ing megmenti, nem számít a szatén. A nadrágja nevetséges lett volna, ha nem hajtják össze a bokákat. A cipő az, amiből a hipszter elegáns happy endek készülnek. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | A talaj hidraulikai tulajdonságainak meghatározása különböző nedvesítő folyadékokkal : A Lincoln Egyetem Master of Science követelményeinek részleges teljesítése<br/><br/>Absztrakt<br/><br/>A talaj hidraulikus tulajdonságai, mint például a hidraulikus vezetőképesség, a vízvisszatartás és a növényi vízkapcsolatok uralják a vízmozgási folyamatokat. Például a beszivárgás, a párolgás és a vízáramlás a talajon belül. A talajban elterjedt jelenségként a talajvíz taszító hatása megváltoztatja a talaj hidraulikus funkcióit azáltal, hogy ellenáll a talajba áramló víznek. Ráadásul a hidraulikus tulajdonságok nemcsak a talaj pórusrendszerétől függenek, hanem a pórusfelületek fizikokémiai tulajdonságai is befolyásolják. A vízhez képest az etanolt az alacsonyabb felületi feszültség miatt nem befolyásolja a víztaszítás. Az etanol használatának célja, hogy megszüntesse a talajvíz visszataszító hatását a hidraulikus tulajdonságok mérésére. A tiszta etanol természetes talajban történő alkalmazása azonban károsíthatja a talaj szerves anyagait, és a fizikai tulajdonságok megváltozásához vezethet. Ezért a vizes etanolos megoldások alternatív megoldást jelenthetnek. Mindazonáltal a vizes etanol használatának megvalósíthatósága a talaj folyadék-visszatartási görbéjének meghatározásához ismeretlen. E tanulmány célja, hogy tesztelje a vizes etanolos oldatok (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 és 100 % v/v) megvalósíthatóságát a folyékony retenciós görbének a különböző nedvesíthetőségű durva homokmintákban és a szerves módosított természetes talajban (Templeton silt loam (TSL) gombakomposzttal, bioszénnel, tejkifolyósítóval és kommunális komposzttal) kis tartományban történő meghatározásához, az alkalmazás aránya 15 % volt. Az eredmény azt mutatta, hogy a vizes etanol oldatok vizsgálatának vízhez viszonyított deszorpciója körülbelül 1-3-szor gyorsabb volt az ugyanazon alkalmazott nyomáson lévő folyadéktartalom és az egyes egyensúlyi állapotok elérésének ideje alapján. A homokkísérlet eredményei arra utaltak, hogy amikor a vizes etanololdat koncentrációja 50 % alatt volt, a párolgási veszteség kevesebb volt, mint 1%, és a vizsgált folyadék és a víz közötti relatív különbség kisebb volt, mint 10 %. A párolgási veszteség azonban 11,06 % és 24,6 % volt, a relatív különbségek pedig az 50 %-os, illetve a 100 %-os etanololdat esetében 15 %, illetve 30 % körül mozogtak. Ezzel szemben a Templeton iszapjának szerves módosításai nemcsak a vízmegtartó képességet növelték, hanem csökkentették a párolgási veszteségeket is. A TSL talajban és a szerves módosításokat tartalmazó TSL talajban a párolgási veszteség 1 % volt az 50 %-nál kevesebb etanoltartalmú oldatokban. Az 50 %-os és a 100 %-os etanol párolgási veszteség 2,8 %, illetve 2,9 % volt. A víz és a vizsgálati folyadék közötti relatív különbségek hasonlóak voltak a homokkísérlethez, amikor a vizsgálati folyadék koncentrációja 50 % alatt volt. Az 50 %-os és a 100 %-os etanololdat relatív különbsége azonban kisebb volt, mint a homokmintában, körülbelül 10 %-kal, illetve 15%-kal. Emellett a relatív különbség elemzése azt sugallta, hogy szinte minden vizes etanol oldatnak alacsonyabb volt a térfogati folyadéktartalma ugyanazon a nyomáson, mint a víznek, ami tükrözi a vizes etanol oldatokat, amelyek gyorsabban deszorbeálódnak, mint a víz azonos nyomáson. Ezért az etanolos oldatok 10-40 %-a alternatívának tekinthető a talaj hidraulikai tulajdonságainak meghatározására, mivel gyorsabb a deszorpciós arányuk, és nem befolyásolja őket a talajvíz visszataszító hatása. A szerves anyagok párolgása és feloldódása miatt az 50% -os koncentráció feletti vizes etanolos oldatok nem voltak alkalmasak durva homokra vagy közepesen texturált talajra....

| Want to plant tomatoes in June or July along the Southern California Coast but not sure the seasonal timing is right? Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around September 3. The state of California is so large that some of its areas are divided into multiple U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones. Otherwise, you will want to plant tomatoes in the spring, as a crop that matures in late summer to early fall. There is a multitude of varieties, filling out the entire spectrum of color, size, and flavor. Anyway, it's important to remember that the numbers in this fall planting guide are only a starting point for you! But with all the weather weirdness happening in Southern California right now, one has to wonder if it's safe to start tomatoes this month as opposed to early spring. Before planting tomatoes, amend the soil with a mushroom compost or mycorrhizal fertilizer. From seed or transplant, follow these steps for successful tomatoes this season. ZONE 7. Look at this load of tomato beauties! by Farmers' Almanac Staff Updated: November 20, 2020 Home & Garden, Planting Guides. It takes a lot of water (and heating energy) to peel three million pounds of processing toma toes in California each year. California, that time changes if planting that vegetable in northern California. The days are bright and warm enough, and if you're starting tomatoes from seed, you can get a jump-start on the season by planting earlier and harvesting earlier. These problems that plague tomatoes grown in containers can magnify in tropical or subtropical climates, where the humidity is turned up and pests multiply. If you are in Zone 10 (parts of Hawaii, southern California and southern Florida), you can plant tomatoes late as a fall crop. All of the following pertains to full-size tomatoes. Oregon's Rogue River Valley, California's High Foothills Growing season: May to early Oct. Summers are hot and dry; typical winter lows run from 23 degrees to 9 degrees F/-5 degrees to -13 degrees C. The summer-winter contrast suits plants that need dry, hot summers and moist, only moderately cold winters. In the U.S. we ripen them by putting them in a sunny east or west window. Tomatoes can be found in nearly every vegetable garden across the country, and with good reason, as little else compares to the flavor of a home-grown tomato. Remove tomato plant from the nursery pot (even if it is a peat pot). Until fairly recently, this favorite fruit was either imported from growers in Mexico or produced as greenhouse tomatoes in California or Arizona. Beans (Zones 3-10): There are two main kinds of beans found in gardens, bush beans and pole beans. The same tips and methods can be applied to late tomato planting in many hot-summer areas. One of the most helpful but often ignored tips in growing tomatoes is not to plant your tomatoes in the garden too early, waiting until all danger of frost has passed (usually in to May). When to Plant Tomatoes in Sacramento Valley. Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around August 1. Transplants can be set into the ground beginning in about April, but tomatoes are warm weather plants, so planting when the weather is warmer is usually better. Suggested varieties: California Wonder, ... It's still not too late to plant tomatoes and peppers from seeds as well. The mycorrhizal fungi assist with water and nutrient absorption by the plant and reduce plant stress. Northern California and the north coast: Growing tomatoes in a greenhouse isn't for the faint of heart; they require specific greenhouse tomato plant care entirely different from other crops. ZONE 8. Month By Month Planting Guide for Southern California: A 'Cheat Sheet' These generalizations are for The Learning Garden, located in Sunset Zone 24, less than 3 miles from the Pacific Ocean in an alluvial plain that is just above sea level. Good luck and good gardening to you. Having grown tomatoes in Southern California since 1979, I had the following intuitive answers from my experience. If you're interested in trying your hand, read on to learn how to grow tomatoes in a greenhouse. Good luck and good gardening to you. Water Soil Consistently . For more information and to find your zone, you can check out the USDA Zone Hardiness Map here. Tomatoes are not hard to grow; they're incredibly productive, versatile in the kitchen, and so delicious off the vine. Southern California Growing Seasons. The Sacramento Valley of California has long, hot dry summers, making it a good environment for growing some varieties of tomatoes… Be sure to check your gardening zone for last frost dates. When to Plant Tomatoes in Zone 8b?. Our guide covers all the information you need to grow tomatoes successfully—including selecting tomato varieties, starting seeds, transplanting tomatoes outside, using tomato stakes and cages, and tomato plant care. Once the plant has reach about 18" (45cm) high it … The roots decompose in the soil and ultimately become nutrients for future vegetables. Only the really immature ones were lost that way. And that is saying a lot, because we certainly grow quite a few delicious heirloom tomato varieties. The Spruce / K. Dave Because containers can dry out quickly, achieving success growing tomatoes in containers depends on maintaining consistent moisture. Choose the varieties wisely. Cold air from the surrounding hills drains into our area and we are reliably cooler than much of the surrounding areas. Stringing Tomatoes – How to String Support Tomatoes. In fact, between our garden and container plantings, usually upwards of 20 or more different tomatoes. Tomato Planting Guide. Studies have shown that they can also increase crop yields, giving you more harvestable fruit. Gardening: The art of planting tomatoes Mar./Apr. 03 of 05.
