| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Attraverso la Bibbia C2000 SeriesCi rivolgiamo al libro degli Atti, capitolo uno, mentre iniziamo il nostro studio della chiesa primitiva.<br/>Luca, autore del libro degli Atti, compagno di Paolo l'apostolo, che fu autore anche del Vangelo secondo Luca, scrisse questi due trattati ad un amico, Teofilo. Teofilo è un nome greco. È un nome che ha un bel significato. Il nome significa amante di Dio. Ci sono alcuni che credono che non era affatto un uomo, ma che il Vangelo e il libro degli Atti erano indirizzati agli amanti di Dio, chiunque voi siate. Ci sono altre tradizioni che dicono che Teofilo era in realtà il padrone di Luca. Che a quei tempi i medici erano schiavi, di solito schiavi di un ricco patrono. Così che il maestro di Luca era Teofilo, e ha rilasciato Luca per essere con Paolo nei viaggi missionari. Così, Luca sta scrivendo di nuovo al suo ex maestro. Questa è una tradizione primitiva della chiesa, ma è, naturalmente, impossibile da dimostrare, come tante delle tradizioni.<br/>Vi sono anche coloro che credono che quando Paolo era a Troade e ricevette una visione di un uomo che lo chiamava dicendo: "Vieni in Macedonia e aiutaci", quell'uomo nella visione di Paolo non era altro che Luca. Perché il primo che Paolo incontrò veramente quando arrivò in Macedonia fu Luca. E come siamo nel libro degli Atti, troverete che quando arriviamo a quella parte del libro degli Atti, Luca inizia a scrivere più in prima persona piuttosto che in terza persona. Così è, evidentemente, a questo punto particolare degli Atti degli Apostoli che Luca divenne un compagno di Paolo e cominciò a viaggiare con lui, cominciando a usare i pronomi "noi" e "noi" invece di "loro" e "loro". Questo è, senza dubbio, dove Luke è diventato un partecipante e un testimone oculare di quelle cose che stavano accadendo da questo punto in poi. Vi porteremo questo a voi quando arriveremo a quel punto.<br/>Egli inizia gli Atti degli Apostoli legandolo al Vangelo secondo Luca. È interessante che l’ultima cosa che Luca registra nel suo Vangelo è la prima cosa che egli registra negli Atti degli Apostoli. Troviamo che il vangelo di Luca si chiude mentre Gesù sta dicendo ai suoi discepoli di aspettare a Gerusalemme finché non siano rivestiti di potenza dall'alto. E poi Gesù è salito in cielo, e così chiude il vangelo. Nell'apertura degli Atti degli Apostoli, egli scrive:<br/>Il primo trattato [cioè, il Vangelo secondo Luca,] ho scritto a voi, o Teofilo, di tutto ciò che Gesù ha cominciato a fare e insegnare (Atti 1:1),<br/>La parola chiave è iniziata. Il Vangelo Secondo Luca non è la storia completa del ministero di Gesù Cristo. È solo l'inizio del ministero di Gesù Cristo. Gesù continua a ministrare ai bisogni delle persone. Gesù continua a guarire i malati. Gesù continua a risuscitare i morti. Gesù continua a ministrare il Suo amore e il Suo vangelo al mondo, solo ora Egli sta ministrando attraverso quei discepoli che sono stati unti con il Suo Spirito Santo. Ma il ministero di Cristo continua; fondamentalmente, è la premessa che Luca prende negli Atti degli Apostoli. Il primo trattato di tutto ciò che Gesù iniziò, sia per fare che per insegnare.<br/>Ora, per questo, gli Atti degli Apostoli sono un libro incompiuto: in questo il Signore oggi continua ad operare attraverso la vita di coloro che si sono dedicati ad essere strumenti di Dio. Essere guidati, guidati e unti dal Suo Spirito Santo, per continuare il ministero di Gesù nel mondo di oggi. Ora Dio ha ordinato che la Sua opera sia compiuta attraverso strumenti umani. Non dico che debba essere compiuta. Dio può usare gli esseri angelici per la Sua opera, e verrà un tempo, durante il libro dell’Apocalisse, in cui Dio userà gli angeli per proclamare il Suo vangelo alle persone di tutto il mondo. Apocalisse, capitolo 14, "Il primo angelo che vola in mezzo al cielo che ha il vangelo eterno" (Apocalisse 14:6 ). Ma al momento presente, Dio ha scelto di utilizzare strumenti umani. Per quanto possano essere imperfetti, tuttavia, questo è ciò che Dio ha ordinato di usare. La cosa eccitante è che Dio mi userà e Dio ti userà. Tante volte, mendichiamo: "O Signore, non posso parlare. Non sono mai stato in grado di parlare prima o anche ora, Signore." Mentre Mosè cercava di mendicare la chiamata di Dio. Geremia disse: "Signore, sono solo un bambino; nessuno mi ascolterà." E tutti noi abbiamo le nostre scuse per il motivo per cui non possiamo essere usati. Non è vero? Sappiamo tutti le ragioni per cui Dio non poteva usarci.<br/>Una volta, mentre il Signore chiamava un profeta a fare la Sua opera, disse: "Signore, manda chi vuoi". Il Signore disse: "Ehi, ti ho chiamato". "Signore, buona idea; manda chi vuoi". Così spesso noi siamo in quella posizione: "Signore, manda per mano di chi vuoi, chiunque tranne me Signore". Eppure, Dio ha ordinato di usarci.<br/>Ora, ognuno di noi può mostrare le proprie imperfezioni. Ognuno di noi può indicare le proprie incapacità, e tutti noi possiamo trovare una scusa per cui Dio non vorrebbe usare me. Ma ancora, Dio ha scelto di usare voi. Che attraverso la tua vita Egli possa rivelarsi a un mondo bisognoso. Ti chiedi quando Dio ha tali strumenti per usare come ha mai fatto il lavoro, non è vero?<br/>Fino al giorno in cui fu assunto, dopo che per mezzo dello Spirito Santo aveva dato comandamenti agli apostoli che aveva eletti (Atti 1:2):<br/>Questo è ciò con cui ha concluso il Vangelo di Luca: il giorno in cui Gesù è stato assunto, dopo aver detto agli apostoli di attendere la dotazione del potere.<br/>A loro egli si mostrò vivo, dopo la sua passione, con molte prove infallibili.<br/>È difficile negare il fatto della risurrezione di Gesù Cristo. Sono stato divertito, così come infastidito e irritato, da un articolo che ho letto nel Registro di Santa Ana questo sabato scorso. Della scienza della creazione e delle teorie evoluzionarie che vengono presentate nelle scuole della contea. In che modo, questo professore ha detto che insegna una classe di scienze, e quindi, si occupano solo di fatti, e che non hanno spazio per le teorie. Perché la scienza si basa sui fatti e la creazione si basa sulle superstizioni religiose. Ci vuole molta fede per credere alle teorie religiose. Quando hai a che fare con i fatti, puoi semplicemente accettarli. Ho pensato, "Molto interessante in quella classe di scienze, mi hanno insegnato che era un fatto che il mondo aveva quattro miliardi di anni. Ora oggi stanno insegnando che è un fatto che il mondo ha dodici miliardi di anni. E non è passato molto tempo da quando sono andato a scuola”.<br/>È interessante notare che la Bibbia non ha mai avuto bisogno di essere rivista o aggiornata per soddisfare i dati attuali che gli uomini hanno scoperto. Eppure, se oggi prendeste i miei libri di scienze delle scuole superiori e cercaste di insegnare una lezione di scienze da loro, scoprireste che molte delle cose che sono state insegnate come fatti scientifici quando ero al liceo non sono più riconosciute come fatti scientifici. Il semplice protoplasma cellulare non è più una semplice cellula, ma estremamente complesso. Se c’è qualche fatto che può essere attestato nella storia è il fatto della risurrezione di Gesù Cristo dai morti.<br/>Abbiamo un sistema di giurisprudenza che si basa sulla testimonianza di testimoni. Se un uomo è accusato di un crimine e ci sono persone che hanno assistito a quel crimine mentre veniva commesso, e sono portati allo standard, e giurano di dire la verità, tutta la verità, e nient’altro che la verità, allora Dio li aiuti. E nel loro interrogatorio affermano che: "Ho visto quell'uomo in banca il ventitreesimo maggio. L'ho visto estrarre una pistola dal suo cappotto. L'ho sentito chiedere che tutti i soldi gli venissero dati. L'ho visto mentre usciva dalla banca. L'ho visto mentre l'ufficiale lo arrestava fuori. E se riuscite ad ottenere tre o quattro testimoni per indicare quell'uomo e a mantenere la loro testimonianza sotto esame incrociato, quell'uomo è giudicato colpevole; è lui che l'ha fatto. Abbiamo due o tre testimoni che stanno testimoniando la stessa storia su quell'uomo, ed è accettato come fatto che sia stato lui a perpetrare il crimine ed è colpevole.<br/>Dopo la morte di Gesù, quando Egli risuscitò, apparve a molte persone diverse che testimoniarono sotto giuramento di averlo visto, di avergli parlato, di essere apparso loro in vari luoghi in circostanze diverse. E per un periodo di quaranta giorni andò in visita con loro. E in un tempo, fino a cinquecento persone che erano radunate in un solo luogo, Egli apparve. È difficile semplicemente mettere da parte o negare la testimonianza di queste persone. Questo significa screditare tutto il nostro sistema giurisprudenziale. Ma non solo, questi uomini che hanno testimoniato di aver visto il Signore risorto, che hanno parlato con Lui, che hanno mangiato con Lui, essi, tutti, ad eccezione di uno, hanno incontrato morti violente per mano di altre persone a causa della loro affermazione che la storia che hanno raccontato era vera. Parli di testimoni che hanno giurato di dire la verita', tutta la verita', nient'altro che la verita'. Se la vita di una persona fosse stata minacciata a causa di quel testimone, ed era una bugia, almeno uno di loro si sarebbe rotto sotto la pressione. Avrebbero confessato l'intera bufala. "Egli si è mostrato vivo dopo la sua passione da molte prove infallibili."<br/>apparve loro per quaranta giorni, parlando loro delle cose che riguardano il regno di Dio (Atti 1:3).<br/>A volte incolpiamo i discepoli a causa delle loro domande sul momento del regno di Dio. Si ricordi che il regno di Dio era il soggetto preferito di Gesù Cristo. Egli parlava sempre del regno di Dio, ed è una grande speranza che Egli stava piantando nei cuori di tutti gli uomini. Le cose non sempre continueranno a essere corrotte come sono. Il mondo non andrà per sempre sotto il potere delle tenebre, sotto la schiavitù del male. Dio un giorno stabilirà il Suo regno sulla terra. Un regno di giusta gioia e pace. "Gesù regnerà, dove prima che il sole corra i suoi viaggi successivi. E il suo regno si estenderà da riva a riva." E quel giorno sarà il giorno più glorioso che il mondo abbia mai visto, come la malattia e la sofferenza e il dolore saranno aboliti nel Suo regno. Come il peccato e l'avidità e queste cose che hanno reso il mondo un luogo così intollerabile saranno aboliti nel Suo regno. Il commercio senza Dio, lo sfruttamento dell'uomo, tutte queste cose sono state abolite nel Suo glorioso regno quando Egli regna. Non c'è da meravigliarsi che i discepoli fossero ansiosi di farlo. Sono ansiosi di farlo; sono ansiosi che il Suo regno venga. E Gesù ci ha detto quando preghiamo, la prima richiesta è: "Venga il tuo regno. Sia fatta la tua volontà in terra come in cielo" ( Matteo 6:10 ). Questo è il giusto tipo di desiderio che dovremmo avere tutti. Desidero il regno di Dio. E così Egli stava parlando loro, durante questo periodo di quaranta giorni, del regno.<br/>Ed essendosi riunito con loro, comandò loro di non allontanarsi da Gerusalemme, ma di attendere la promessa del Padre, la quale, dice, avete udita da me (Atti 1:4).<br/>Egli disse: “Ora, guarda, aspetta qui a Gerusalemme, finché non avrai ricevuto la promessa del Padre”. Questa promessa a cui Egli si riferisce è, senza dubbio, la promessa in Gioele, dove il Signore promise: "E avverrà negli ultimi giorni, dice il Signore, che io riverserò il mio Spirito su ogni carne; e i vostri figli e le vostre figlie profetizzeranno, e i vostri giovani faranno sogni, i vostri vecchi vedranno visioni; e sui miei servi e sulle mie ancelle, il Signore riverserà il mio Spirito". La promessa del Padre: verrà il giorno in cui Dio riverserà il Suo Spirito su ogni carne, su tutti i credenti, e ognuno di loro riceverà questa dinamica da Dio.<br/>Giovanni infatti battezzò con acqua, ma voi sarete battezzati con lo Spirito Santo fra non molti giorni (Atti 1:5).<br/>L'idea del battesimo era quella dell'emersione, il battesimo. Giovanni battezzò con acqua, immerse la gente nell'acqua, "sarete immersi nello Spirito Santo in non molti giorni".<br/>E quando furono radunati, gli chiesero: Signore, ristabilirai tu in questo tempo il regno d’Israele?<br/>"Quando sarà, Signore? Quando sarà il tempo per questa restaurazione?" E Gesù sta parlando loro ora, non del regno, ma del potere che riceveranno per il servizio. E così Egli spazza via la loro domanda.<br/>Dicendo loro: Non spetta a voi conoscere i tempi o le stagioni, che il Padre ha posto in sua propria potenza (Atti 1:7).<br/>"Non sta a voi saperlo." Vivevano costantemente nell'anticipazione dell'immediata istituzione del regno. Durante tutta la vita di Gesù, Lo aspettavano in qualsiasi momento di entrare nella cabina telefonica e uscire come il salvatore del mondo. Shazzam! Mostrando la Sua potenza e rovesciando i governi del mondo, stabilendo il regno di Dio sulla terra. Ed essi aspettavano ogni giorno che questo cambiamento trascorresse. E ogni volta che Gesù parlava di andare a Gerusalemme, di essere consegnato nelle mani di un uomo peccatore, e poi di essere crocifisso, "Oh, oh no, Signore. No, tu non capisci il regno, Signore. Quando Gesù morì sulla croce, tutti rimasero molto delusi.<br/>I due discepoli sulla strada per Emmaus, così tristi. "Ehi, ragazzi. Come mai siete così tristi come il vostro camminare lungo?" "Che cosa volete dire? Dovete essere uno straniero qui intorno se non sapete le cose che stanno accadendo ultimamente a Gerusalemme." "Che cose?" "Oh, un uomo di nome Gesù di Nazareth... oh uomo, era potente e potente. L'unzione di Dio era sulla Sua vita. Avevamo sperato che in Lui fosse la liberazione di Israele, ma loro Lo hanno crocifisso. Avevamo sperato . . . ora è morto." Ora Egli è risorto, e sta dicendo: "Tra pochi giorni, compagni, riceverete la promessa del Padre." "Oh, quale promessa? La promessa dell'instaurazione del regno?" Vedete, era legittimo che essi chiedessero: "È questo il Signore? Va bene! È questo il tempo? Stabilirai ora il tuo regno? "No. Non spetta a te conoscere quei tempi che il Padre ha fissato o che il Padre ha in sua propria potenza; ma riceverai potenza quando lo Spirito Santo sarà venuto su di te.<br/>Ora qui, la preposizione greca epi è usata per indicare una nuova relazione che dovevano avere con lo Spirito Santo. Nel Vangelo secondo Giovanni, capitolo 14, mentre Gesù promette di inviare lo Spirito Santo, disse: "Non vi lascerò senza conforto. Io verrò a voi, e pregherò il Padre, ed egli vi manderà un altro consolatore, lo Spirito di verità, che il mondo non può ricevere, perché non lo vede e non lo conosce, ma voi lo conoscete, perché egli abita con voi ed egli sarà in voi” (Gv 14,17-18). Stessa preposizione greca come la nostra, solo che la scrivono "en" anziché "in". In Giovanni c'è una duplice relazione: Egli è con voi, ma dimorerà in voi. Ma ora Gesù ha detto che riceverete potenza quando lo Spirito Santo verrà su di voi. La preposizione greca epi, che è tradotta in diversi testi in tutto il Nuovo Testamento come "su" o "sopra" o "mi piace", "trabocca".<br/>Nel settimo capitolo del vangelo di Giovanni: "L'ultimo giorno, il grande giorno della festa, quando Gesù stava là sul monte del tempio e gridò al popolo: 'Se qualcuno ha sete venga a me e beva; e chi beve dell'acqua che io do, dal suo intimo sgorgherà torrenti di acqua viva'". Giovanni disse: "Questo egli ha parlato dello Spirito, che non è stato ancora dato che coloro che credono in lui dovrebbero ricevere" (Giovanni 7:37-39 ). Che cosa ha parlato dello Spirito? Che sarebbe stato come un torrente di acqua viva che scorre. Mi piace, "Quando lo Spirito ti trabocca", su di te, o su di te, o trabocca da te. Quindi la triplice relazione: Egli è con te prima della tua conversione, Egli è colui che ti fa capire che sei un peccatore, Egli è colui che indica Gesù Cristo come la risposta mentre convince il mondo del peccato, del giusto e del giudizio. Nel momento in cui aprite la vostra vita e il vostro cuore a Gesù Cristo e Lo invitate ad entrare, lo Spirito Santo viene e comincia ad abitarvi. Egli sarà in voi. "Non sapete che non siete vostri, che siete stati comprati a prezzo; glorificate dunque Dio nel vostro corpo e nel vostro spirito, che sono suoi; e non sapete che il vostro corpo è il tempio dello Spirito Santo che è in voi? Non siate ubriachi di vino, dove c'è eccesso, ma siate saziati, o siate saziati dello Spirito" (1 Corinzi 6:19-20; Efesini 5:18). Ma ora ecco una terza relazione. Questa è un'esperienza di potenziamento.<br/>Riceverete la dinamica, quando lo Spirito Santo sarà venuto su di voi [o sopra di voi, o quando c'è qualcosa che trabocca da voi] e mi sarete testimoni (Atti 1:8).<br/>E così la dinamica, quella di essere testimone di Gesù Cristo. È interessante che la parola testimone in greco sia la parola martus da cui deriva la nostra parola martire. E in greco significa martire. Un testimone è colui che non solo proclama ciò in cui crede, ma vive ciò in cui crede, è ciò in cui crede, e lo crede così fortemente che, se necessario, morirà per ciò in cui crede. Non puoi fermarlo, non ha paura di morire per quello che crede.<br/>Ricordi quando Paolo stava tornando a Gerusalemme e Agabo scese da Cesarea e prese la cintura di Paolo e si legò e disse: "Così è l'uomo che possiede questa cintura per essere legato quando arriverà a Gerusalemme". E gli amici di Paolo cominciarono a piangere, dicendo: "Oh, Paul, non andare, non andare." E lui disse: "Che cosa intendi con queste lacrime? Pensi di dissuadermi? Pensi che io sia preoccupato di essere legato? Sono pronto a morire." Era un martese. "Sono pronto a morire". Essere messo a morte per la tua fede non ti ha reso un martire; perché eri un martire, sei stato messo a morte. Perché eri un testimone, perché lo credevi così forte. Quindi, non ti ha reso un testimone, ha solo dimostrato quello che eri. Eri un testimone da sempre. Se non fossi stato un martus, non saresti mai andato alla tua morte. Ti saresti ritirato; avresti detto, "Whoa, whoa, aspetta, aspetta. Aspetta, cambiamo rotta qui. Penso di aver commesso un errore." Poi dici: "Beh, non era un martus. Rubare un cavallo non ti rende un ladro di cavalli; prova solo che lo sei stato. Nessuno ruba un cavallo a meno che non sia un ladro di cavalli. Quindi, rubarlo non ti rende un ladro di cavalli, prova solo che eri sempre stato. Essere martirizzato dimostra solo ciò che eri un testimone, un martus. "E sarete testimoni." E non è interessante che la maggior parte di loro sono stati martirizzati? "Testimoni a Me".<br/>La testimonianza doveva essere sia a Gerusalemme, e in tutta la Giudea (Atti 1:8),<br/>La testimonianza è iniziata proprio a casa. Il posto più difficile, non è vero? È cominciare direttamente a casa a Gerusalemme, e poi l'area intorno a Gerusalemme, l'area della Giudea. E poi si è diffusa in Samaria. E poi doveva andare nelle estreme parti del mondo. E mentre studiamo il libro degli Atti, vedremo questa progressione. Come ebbe inizio la testimonianza a Gerusalemme. Lo capiremo nel prossimo capitolo. E poi vedremo come cominciò a diffondersi in tutta la Giudea. E poi Filippo salì in Samaria, e poi finalmente Paolo e Barnaba sono chiamati ad andare nelle parti più estreme del mondo. E così la testimonianza si diffuse attraverso l’unzione e la potenza dello Spirito Santo.<br/>E quando ebbe detto queste cose, mentre essi le guardavano, fu sollevato; e una nube lo ritirò dalla loro vista (Atti 1:9).<br/>Questa è la promessa finale fatta da Gesù ai Suoi discepoli. Questa è la parola finale prima della Sua ascensione. Naturalmente, più tardi Egli venne e parlò a Paolo e ad altri, ma prima della Sua ascensione, questa è la Sua parola finale. E quando ebbe detto queste cose, mentre lo stavano osservando, fu sollevato e una nube lo accolse lontano dai loro occhi.<br/>Mentre essi guardavano verso il cielo mentre egli saliva, ecco due uomini che stavano accanto a loro in vesti bianche (Atti 1:10).<br/>Supponiamo che fossero angeli.<br/>Il quale disse anche: Uomini di Galilea, perché state fissando il cielo? Questo stesso Gesù, che è stato portato da voi in cielo, verrà nello stesso modo in cui l’avete visto andare in cielo (Atti 1:11).<br/>Lo videro mentre saliva in cielo e lo vedranno quando tornerà: “Ecco, il Signore viene con diecimila dei suoi santi per eseguire il giudizio sulla terra” (Giuda 1:14-15). E poi: "A Colui che ci ha amati e ha dato se stesso per noi e che ci ha fatti per il nostro Dio, re e sacerdoti che regneranno con lui sulla terra, ecco il Signore viene, e ogni occhio lo vedrà, e anche quelli che lo trafissero faranno cordoglio" Ap 1:5-7 ). Così viene il Signore. Ogni occhio Lo vedrà. I Testimoni di Geova dicono che Egli è già venuto, ma è stato un segreto venire. Poiché sono stati solo i discepoli che Lo hanno visto andare, sono stati solo i discepoli, dei Testimoni di Geova, che Lo hanno visto tornare. Ma Gesù disse: «Se vi dicono: ‘È venuto in segreto ed è entrato in una stanza segreta, non credeteci’» (Matteo 24:26). Dovete dunque scegliere se credere a Gesù o a loro.<br/>"Questo stesso Gesù, che è stato portato da voi in cielo, verrà nello stesso modo in cui l'avete visto andare in cielo."<br/>Ora c'è un versetto molto interessante in II Giovanni, versetto Atti 1:7, "Per molti ingannatori sono entrati nel mondo che non confessano che Gesù Cristo è venuto nella carne." Che, purtroppo, è una cattiva traduzione del greco. Poiché questo participio è nel tempo presente e dovrebbe essere tradotto "viene nella carne". Coloro che negherebbero che Gesù Cristo viene nella carne. Cosa dice Giovanni di loro? "Sono un ingannatore e un anticristo. Guardatevi da voi stessi, perché non perdiamo ciò che abbiamo fatto, ma riceviamo piena ricompensa; perché chi trasgredisce e non dimora nella dottrina di Cristo, non ha Dio. Chi dimora nella dottrina di Cristo, ha sia il Padre che il Figlio; e se qualcuno viene alla vostra porta e non porta questa dottrina, non lo riceva in casa vostra e non gli dica addio. Poiché chi lo saluta è partecipe delle sue cattive azioni" (2Gv 1:7-11). Chiedete loro una cosa: "Gesù viene nella carne?" Fate loro quella domanda. E se dicono di no, ricordatevi di ciò che Giovanni vi ha avvertito e di ciò che Giovanni vi ha detto. "Se qualcuno non confessa che Gesù Cristo viene nella carne." Ricordate quando Egli era con i discepoli e disse: "Datemi da mangiare?" Egli disse: "Sapete, gli spiriti non mangiano; toccatemi. Vedete? Sono io". Quindi, questo stesso Gesù sta tornando di nuovo nello stesso modo in cui lo hanno visto andare in cielo. E io, per uno, credo che quella venuta è molto presto.<br/>Poi tornarono a Gerusalemme dal monte chiamato degli Ulivi, che da Gerusalemme è un viaggio di sabato. Entrati, salirono al piano superiore, dove dimoravano Pietro, Giacomo, Giovanni, Andrea, Filippo, Tommaso, Bartolomeo, Matteo, Giacomo, figlio di Alfeo, Simone Zelota e Giuda, fratello di Giacomo. E tutti questi continuarono insieme in preghiera e supplicazione, con le donne, e Maria la madre di Gesù, e con i suoi fratelli (Atti 1:12-14).<br/>Questa è l'ultima menzione di Maria, la madre di Gesù. A questo punto e da questo punto in poi, non c'è più alcuna menzione di lei negli Atti degli Apostoli o nelle epistole. Nessuna menzione della sua morte o della sua miracolosa ascensione al cielo, senza morte. Nulla è menzionato nella Scrittura, è silenzioso.<br/>I suoi fratelli sarebbero un riferimento probabilmente a Giacomo e a Giuda e a quegli altri fratelli che erano figli di Giuseppe e Maria.<br/>La stanza superiore – ci sono alcuni che dicono che è la stessa stanza superiore in cui Gesù ebbe l’Ultima Cena con i Suoi discepoli. Eppure, ci sono altri che sostengono che questa stanza superiore sia una stanza nei recinti del tempio dove la chiesa primitiva si riuniva. Fate la vostra scelta.<br/>E in quei giorni Pietro si alzò in mezzo ai discepoli, e disse, (il numero dei loro nomi erano circa centoventi,) uomini e fratelli, questa Scrittura deve essere stato adempiuto, che lo Spirito Santo ha parlato per bocca di Davide prima di Giuda, che era una guida per coloro che hanno preso Gesù (Atti 1:15-16).<br/>Ancora una volta, Pietro è ancora il suo stesso sé impetuoso. Stanno aspettando in preghiera e supplicazione, e Pietro si alza e dice: "Compagni, c'è una Scrittura che deve essere adempiuta." E sapete che andrà avanti: "Andiamo avanti con il programma; gettiamo a sorte e scopriamo chi prenderà il posto di Giuda". Sento che Pietro era di nuovo nella carne, manifestando quella natura impetuosa che era sua. E penso che la storia futura della chiesa nel libro degli Atti lo indichi. Sono interessato alla comprensione che Pietro ha delle Scritture, come egli sta citando da così tanti luoghi nell'Antico Testamento. Pietro manifesta una grande comprensione delle Scritture dell’Antico Testamento, che è un punto a suo favore.<br/>Notate che Pietro attribuisce allo Spirito Santo quelle cose che Davide scrisse. Così, "Tutta la Scrittura è data da ispirazione di Dio" (2Tim 3:16). Non parte delle Scritture. Perché, se mi dici che parte delle Scritture sono date dall’ispirazione di Dio, allora devo chiederti: “Quali parti sono per ispirazione e quali parti non sono per ispirazione?” E poi tu sei l'autorità che mi dice in quale parte posso credere e in quale parte non posso credere. E nel momento in cui Dio non è più l'autorità, ma tu sei l'autorità, io sono nei guai. Guardatevi da coloro che dicono: "Bene, non potete credere a tutte le Scritture". Le stesse Scritture dicono: "Tutta la Scrittura è ispirata da Dio". E qui, Luca scrivendo di ciò che Pietro stava dicendo, dichiara che Davide era in realtà il portavoce dello Spirito Santo. Lo Spirito Santo, per bocca di Davide, parlò di Giuda.<br/>Poiché era stato annoverato con noi, [era uno dei dodici] aveva ottenuto una parte di questo ministero. Ma ora quest'uomo ha acquistato un campo con la ricompensa dell'iniquità, e cadendo a testa alta (Atti 1:17-18 ),<br/>Ha acquistato il campo, il campo del vasaio come dichiara Zaccaria l'undicesimo capitolo.<br/>e cadde a testa in giù, si spaccò in mezzo, e tutti i suoi intestini si riversarono (Atti 1:18).<br/>Ci sono quelli che trovano una discrepanza nelle Scritture, perché in uno dei Vangeli ci è detto che quando Giuda è tornato e ha cercato di restituire il denaro, e hanno detto: "Ehi, è un tuo problema. Non possiamo accettarlo." E lo abbiamo messo di nuovo nel tesoro del tempio. "È denaro di sangue." Poi lo gettò lì sul pavimento del tempio e uscì e si impiccò. Qui Pietro ci dice che è caduto a testa in giù e appena scoppiato. E ci sono quelli che immaginano una discrepanza. Molto semplice, salì sull'albero per impiccarsi, legò la corda al collo e la legò all'arto e saltò. E la forza della caduta spezzò la corda o la testa, e cadde nel canyon e proprio come ha detto qui.<br/>Era noto a tutti gli abitanti di Gerusalemme, tanto che il campo si chiama nella loro lingua Aceldama, cioè Campo di sangue. Poiché sta scritto nel libro dei Salmi: La sua dimora sia desolata, e nessuno vi abiti; e: Il suo vescovato ne prenda un altro (Atti 1:19-20).<br/>Ora, in realtà, qui sta citando due salmi diversi. Dal Salmo 69:25 , lo mette insieme con il Salmo 109:8 . E mettendo insieme i due trova queste profezie riguardanti Giuda.<br/>Perciò di questi uomini (Atti 1:21)<br/>Ora qui è dove stanno cercando qualcuno per prendere il posto di Giuda per essere un apostolo. Ecco le qualifiche che stavano cercando in quel momento.<br/>Perciò, fra questi uomini, che sono stati con noi per tutto il tempo che il Signore Gesù è entrato e uscito in mezzo a noi (Atti 1:21),<br/>Ora vi ricordate che c'erano molti discepoli, molti dei quali Gesù ha scelto dieci per essere apostoli. E la parola apostolo significa "colui che è mandato fuori". O ha scelto dodici per essere apostoli, quindi ha inviato i dodici. Il numero del governo umano. "Abbiamo solo undici. Abbiamo bisogno di uno per prendere il posto di Giuda, ma abbiamo bisogno di uno che è stato con noi tutto il tempo dal principio con Gesù."<br/>Dal momento in cui fu battezzato da Giovanni, fino al giorno in cui fu assunto da noi, uno deve essere ordinato testimone [di cosa?] della sua risurrezione (Atti 1:22).<br/>Quindi questi erano i requisiti che stavano cercando. Qualcuno che era stato in giro per tutto il tempo. Dal momento del battesimo di Giovanni all'ascensione. E uno che ha visto il Signore risorto, e quindi poteva sopportare il fatto della risurrezione, la loro testimonianza al fatto.<br/>Ora Paolo, l'apostolo, più tardi nell'affermare il fatto che era un apostolo ha detto: "Non ho visto il Cristo risorto?" Evidentemente questo era uno dei requisiti dell'apostolato. Qualcuno mi ha chiesto, "Ci sono apostoli oggi?" Beh, non lo so. Non credo che ci siano nello stesso senso in cui erano nel Nuovo Testamento. Certamente non c'è nessuno oggi che può testimoniare la risurrezione come lo hanno fatto.<br/>Ne nominarono due, Giuseppe, chiamato Barsabba, soprannominato Giusto, e Mattia, e pregarono dicendo: «Tu, Signore, che conosci i cuori di tutti, mostra se hai scelto uno di questi due» (Atti 1:23-24).<br/>Penso che spesso facciamo questo errore di dare al Signore due scelte, entrambe sbagliate. Limitare Dio, vedi. Siamo così inclini a farlo. Ovviamente, Paolo era la scelta di Dio. Peter era impetuoso, e saltando la pistola disse: "Ehi, dobbiamo fare qualcosa, sai, dobbiamo aiutare Dio. Sai, ne manca uno e dobbiamo riempirlo." E ancora, "Dio, quale di questi due vuoi?" E dando a Dio le due scelte.<br/>Affinché egli potesse prendere parte a questo ministero e a questo apostolato, dal quale Giuda per la trasgressione cadde, per poter andare al suo posto. E così diedero la loro sorte (Atti 1:25-26 );<br/>Un modo interessante con cui hanno cercato di determinare la volontà di Dio. Gettiamo i dadi, scopriamo qual è la volontà di Dio qui. È interessante per me, i vari modi che le persone hanno escogitato per discernere la volontà di Dio. Ora, nei tempi dell'Antico Testamento avevano un modo interessante di venire dal sacerdote, che avrebbe chiesto al Signore per loro attraverso l'Urim e il Tummim, le "luci e le perfezioni". Proprio quello che questi Urim e Tummim erano, non lo sappiamo. Sono sicuro che non erano gli occhiali colorati che Joseph Smith ha trovato con le tavolette d'oro; gli occhiali magici, che quando li metti, all'improvviso puoi leggere la scrittura geroglifica.<br/>C’è chi dice che l’Urim e il Tumim erano in realtà una pietra bianca e nera che veniva indossata in una borsa sul petto del sacerdote. Pregavano e facevano al Signore una domanda particolare. Ricordi che Davide chiedeva al Signore domande precise: "Signore, usciamo contro i Filistei?" La risposta fu: "No". E il giorno dopo di nuovo: "Signore, usciamo contro i Filistei?" La risposta fu: "Sì". "Quando andremo?" Essi facevano domande specifiche, e il Signore li guidava attraverso l’Urim e il Tummin. Dicono che il sacerdote pregava, cercava Dio, e poi raggiungeva e tirava fuori una delle due pietre. Se era la pietra bianca, era una risposta sì. Se fosse un no, allora sarebbe la pietra nera che avrebbe tirato fuori. Alcuni dicono addirittura che il termine viene sballato da questo Urim e Thummim. In realtà, nell'originale è un no al voto contro un particolare progetto o idea. Non sappiamo cosa fossero gli Urim e i Tummim, ma durante il periodo dell'Antico Testamento usavano un metodo di sorteggio per determinare la volontà di Dio.<br/>Quindi qui i discepoli stanno raccogliendo la stessa cosa mentre stanno lanciando i dadi per vedere quale dei due compagni che Dio aveva scelto per sostituire Giuda Iscariota.<br/>la sorte cadde su Mattia; egli fu censito con gli undici (Atti 1:26).<br/>Ora chi nel mondo è Mattia? Nessuno ha mai sentito parlare di lui prima o dopo. Sarà interessante incontrare Mattia e scoprire chi è e cosa ha fatto. Penso che dalla storia successiva, è ovvio supporre che Dio abbia scelto Paolo come apostolo. Ora questa è l’ultima volta che leggiamo di loro cercando di discernere la volontà di Dio mediante il lancio a sorte o per una sorta di caso.<br/>Conosco oggi un uomo che, cercando di discernere la volontà del Signore, pregherà e farà una domanda al Signore. Avrà dieci centesimi in tasca, e mentre prega, prenderà i centesimi con gli occhi chiusi e li metterà sul tavolo, e se tutti si alzano di testa, è un sì. Una cosa interessante, di tanto in tanto, tutti si faranno avanti, e questa è una buona probabilità. Eppure, non troviamo alcun modello per questo dopo che lo Spirito Santo è stato dato. Una volta che lo Spirito Santo venne sulla chiesa, allora lo Spirito Santo cominciò a parlare loro e a dirigerli. E lo Spirito Santo disse: "Separatemi Paolo e Barnaba per il ministero al quale li ho chiamati" (Atti 13:2). E lo Spirito Santo li ha mandati fuori. Così troviamo la chiesa più direttamente guidata dallo Spirito Santo. Una volta che lo Spirito Santo è venuto, questo lancio di dadi per scoprire la volontà di Dio è stato messo da parte.<br/>"<br/><br/>Versione King James<br/><br/>Questa è la versione del 1769 di King James della Sacra Bibbia (nota anche come versione autorizzata). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

In effetti, i driver dinamici funzionano esattamente come i microfoni dinamici, ma al contrario.

A seconda della direzione della corrente, la polarità del magnete cambierà. Ora che sappiamo che per un magnete, le stesse cariche respingono e cariche diverse si attraggono, sappiamo che la bobina vocale si muoverà avanti e indietro a seconda della sua polarità in quel momento. La bobina vocale è attaccata al diaframma che poi si muove avanti e indietro creando un'onda sonora. Lo stesso accade in senso inverso, se si sposta una bobina attraverso un magnete si produce invece una corrente.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill.

And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell è nerfing brawlers invece di nerfing star powers. Ero a 750 la scorsa stagione con potenza 8 nita ed è molto difficile andare oltre che, tipo, star powers giocare un ruolo davvero dominante. Il matchmaking è anche spazzatura. Quando gioco a prendere gemme (circa 600 trofei), ci sono spesso incontri in cui la squadra nemica ha un giocatore in più di noi che è al massimo e non è nemmeno che abbiamo un lvl 9 per competere contro quello. A volte ci sono anche incontri in cui la squadra nemica è completamente max e nessuno di noi lo è. questo è il motivo per cui non gioco più sul serio le stelle della rissa. Non è nemmeno come se non ci fossero molti giocatori che non sono max e circa 600 trofei. È fastidioso.<br/>Edit: Penso che supercell dovrebbe avere almeno un meccanismo di base che prenda la media dei livelli dei combattenti quando si impostano le partite.<br/><br/>Tranne che i trofei non indicano davvero la tua abilità. Indicano l'abilità dei compagni di squadra con cui sei posizionato. E va bene giocare contro brawler di livello superiore, ma quando una squadra è tutta di livello 10 e l'altra squadra non lo è, chiaramente è squilibrato.<br/><br/>Raccomando di avere alcuni buoni amici con cui giocare, io e 2 amici abbiamo ottenuto i miei amici il potere 1 tick al rango 28 giocando gem grab con una certa composizione tutto il giorno e ce l'abbiamo fatta senza che uno solo di noi fosse maxed con i nostri brawlers.<br/><br/>So come vi sentite che ho usato per avere brawlers in trofei alti con basso livello ed è difficile andare oltre e tutto quello che mi dicevo "Voglio avere poteri stellari" davvero supercell bisogno di fare equilibrio con i poteri stellari o almeno fare un sistema di matchmaking migliore.<br/><br/>Mi sento un po 'questo. Non sono bravo nel gioco come te, ma ho ottenuto Emz a 500 al potere 1 e il matchmaking è stato orribile. Maxed giocatori ovunque! E non ha aiutato che la maggior parte dei miei compagni di squadra avevano circa 5-8k trofei ... Ho dovuto ricorrere allo scontro da solo all'ultimo minuto perché posso imboscare giocatori ignari o semplicemente giocare un po' aggressivo nei momenti giusti. Ma vorrei davvero che potesse essere un po 'più facile per le persone che vogliono spingere i wrestler a intervalli di trofei davvero alti senza avere il lusso dei poteri stellari.<br/><br/>Altho spike è ancora buono senza curveball. Curveball era solo un aiuto per colpire i tuoi colpi più spesso come spike. Ma anche prima che curveball fosse rilasciato, spike era un brawler davvero forte, quindi rimarrà lo stesso ora.<br/><br/>Sono d'accordo che avrebbero dovuto agguantare i nervi, ma penso che stiano cercando di bilanciare Snappy Sniping e Ambush, poiché entrambi si stanno fondendo con questo cambiamento. Stava diventando un po 'potente, ma ancora non degno di nervi<br/><br/>Non sono sicuro di questo, ma ora che Darryl ha un notevole buff, guardando le loro nuove statistiche, sembra che Darryl potrebbe oscurare Bull, poiché non solo può sempre infliggere più danni di Bull, non morirà più presto, quindi la loro sopravvivenza sarà simile senza potere stellare (anche se la sopravvivenza di Bull è ancora notevolmente migliore di quella di Darryl se avesse avuto Tough). Non solo, il super di Darryl può rigenerarsi automaticamente, il che significa che Darryl potrebbe essere in grado di essere giocato efficacemente sia come un peso pesante che come un assassino allo stesso tempo (prima che succhi come un peso pesante ma decente come un assassino).<br/><br/>Ma è sopravvalutato af. E si ottengono trofei con lui davvero facilmente. Così im un po 'ok con il nervo. Non l'ho nemmeno giocato da quando l'ho portato a 500 (circa 5 mesi fa), quindi non che mi importa molto anche.<br/><br/>Perché Poco / Penny non ottiene un nervo HP, se sono rispettivamente Marksman / Healer non un serbatoio?<br/>Perche' la tankyness di Rosa non e' nervata, tosse che riduce i danni del 70%?<br/>Perché Tick può avere la gamma più alta e il pokedamage più gratuito dell'intero gioco?<br/>Perché Leon non ottiene un potenziamento HP/Danni?<br/><br/>Ad ogni modo, era Ambush che era OP, non Piper base. Sosterrei che Ambush è la migliore potenza stellare del gioco (ora ancora di più poiché la percentuale di aumento dei danni è salita indirettamente) e Piper base era un wrestler bottom-10.<br/><br/>Ciò che Supercell dovrebbe fare è invertire entrambi i nervi, ridurre l'imboscata a 600 e ridurre lo Snappy Sniping a 0.25 poiché verrebbe indirettamente potenziato dal buff dei danni base.<br/><br/>Sì e credo che siano andati un po 'troppo lontano con Rosa, perché ora è fondamentalmente il toro migliore ora quando si tratta di rifornimento, che è stato per un po'. Ora, Darryl potrebbe anche essere un toro più piccolo e più potente<br/><br/>Perché? Sento che ha bisogno di un miglioramento in quasi tutto tranne il suo potere stellare. La sua salute e la velocità la rendono un po 'più difficile da usare, perché può morire abbastanza facilmente, ed è davvero difficile per lei intrappolare brawler più veloci come Crow. Il suo potere stellare è un po 'rotto anche se... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Lavoro autonomo Parte 1<br/><br/>Quando accetti un impiego in qualsiasi organizzazione, devi svolgere vari lavori secondo i requisiti del tuo datore di lavoro e puoi ottenere un importo fisso di reddito come stipendio. È possibile gestire un piccolo negozio al dettaglio, sartoria, ristorante, panetteria e pasticceria, salone di bellezza, ecc. nella vostra località. È possibile impegnarsi nel commercio o nella produzione su piccola scala o fornire alcuni servizi a un prezzo. Tali attività economiche sono conosciute come lavoro autonomo.<br/><br/>Significato di lavoro autonomo<br/><br/>Il guadagno è necessario per vivere. Il nostro padre, la madre, i fratelli, le sorelle e altri possono essere impegnati in diverse attività economiche attraverso le quali guadagnano il loro sostentamento. Queste persone sono impegnate in un'attività economica che si chiama occupazione salariata o occupazione retribuita, ma ci sono molte persone che si impegnano in un'occupazione o in un'attività che iniziano e gestiscono da sole. Hanno messo il loro meglio e prendere tutti i tipi di rischi per perseguire la loro carriera con successo. L'intero guadagno del loro lavoro va a loro. Tutti noi abbiamo visto piccoli negozi di alimentari, negozi di sartoria, negozi medici ecc nella nostra località. Questi sono di proprietà e gestiti da una persona, con o senza l'aiuto di alcuni assistenti. Le loro attività economiche sono chiamate lavoro autonomo. Quindi, quando un individuo si impegna in qualsiasi attività economica e la gestisce da solo, è noto come lavoro autonomo.<br/><br/>Obiettivi<br/><br/>Dopo aver studiato questa lezione, sarai in grado di:<br/><br/>Immagine degli obiettivi<br/><br/>Immagine degli obiettivi<br/><br/>Caratteristiche del lavoro autonomo<br/><br/>Esso comporta la proprietà e la gestione delle attività da parte di una persona, anche se essa può avvalersi dell'aiuto di una o due persone per assisterla.<br/><br/>Il reddito da lavoro autonomo non è fisso; dipende dal reddito che si può guadagnare producendo o acquistando e vendendo beni o fornendo servizi ad altri a un prezzo.<br/><br/>Nel lavoro autonomo, il proprietario da solo deve prendere il profitto e sopportare il rischio di perdita. Quindi, troviamo un collegamento diretto tra lo sforzo e la ricompensa nel lavoro autonomo.<br/><br/>Richiede una certa quantità di investimento di capitale, anche se può essere piccolo.<br/><br/>Nel lavoro autonomo, una persona è libera di prendere decisioni per quanto riguarda la gestione della sua attività in modo redditizio e approfittare di qualsiasi opportunità che possa sorgere per l'espansione della sua attività. Dà completa libertà di lavorare secondo la propria volontà e entro i parametri delle leggi vigenti.<br/><br/>Così, il lavoro autonomo può essere definito come, un'attività economica che uno può svolgere da solo come un'occupazione redditizia, e questo può consistere nella produzione e vendita di beni, l'acquisto e la vendita di beni, o la prestazione di servizi per un prezzo. |
