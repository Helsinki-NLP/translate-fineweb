| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Oggi, 49 anni fa, il presidente Lyndon B. Johnson ha firmato il Voting Rights Act del 1965.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Quasi un secolo fa, il 15 ° emendamento della Costituzione affermava: "Il diritto dei cittadini degli Stati Uniti di votare non sarà negato o abbreviato dagli Stati Uniti o da qualsiasi stato a causa della razza, del colore o della precedente condizione di servitù". E quasi un secolo prima, i padri fondatori della nostra nazione hanno messo in moto il grande esperimento della democrazia americana dichiarando che "tutti gli uomini sono creati uguali".<br/><br/>Il Voting Rights Act del 1965 è stato un riconoscimento tardivo che anche in America, i nostri ideali fondamentali hanno poco peso, se non protetto dallo stato di diritto. Questo è il motivo per cui la Sezione 2 del 15 ° Emendamento ha concesso al Congresso il "potere di far rispettare questo articolo con una legislazione appropriata".<br/><br/>E infatti, il linguaggio codificato del Voting Rights Act è stato in grado di realizzare ciò che il Congresso dell’era della Ricostruzione e Thomas Jefferson non hanno potuto. Il Civil Rights Act del 1964 e il Voting Rights Act – e il movimento per i diritti civili da cui sono emersi – sono serviti come catalizzatore per un drammatico aumento delle opportunità per i neri americani di partecipare al processo democratico.<br/><br/>Ad esempio, solo il 6,7 per cento dei Mississippiani neri idonei erano registrati per votare nel 1962; nel 1969 quella cifra aveva raggiunto il 66,5%. Oggi, il Mississippi ha più funzionari eletti neri di qualsiasi altro stato.<br/><br/>Le protezioni messe in atto dalla legge sui diritti di voto erano in ritardo da tempo quando sono state approvate, rappresentative della dura lotta con cui sono state raggiunte. Ma impensabilmente, queste protezioni sono ora sotto attacco, mettendo a repentaglio i progressi che la nostra nazione ha lavorato così duramente per raggiungere.<br/><br/>L’anno scorso, nel caso Shelby County v. Holder, la Corte Suprema degli Stati Uniti ha sventrato una componente chiave del Voting Rights Act che ha permesso una precedente revisione federale per garantire la non discriminazione prima che qualsiasi nuova legge di voto entri in vigore.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Purtroppo, la risposta dei leader repubblicani è stata di non fare nulla. Il senatore Ted Cruz e il governatore Rick Perry hanno fatto di tutto per lodare la decisione della Corte Suprema. Il senatore Rand Paul ha respinto la continua necessità del Voting Rights Act osservando: "Abbiamo un presidente afro-americano".<br/><br/>Mentre l'elezione del presidente Barack Obama è stata davvero una pietra miliare storica, è pericoloso pensare che ci assolve dal rimanere vigili contro le conseguenze persistenti del passato della nostra nazione. La fretta con cui gli Stati si sono mossi per emanare restrizioni al voto è la conferma che le protezioni messe in atto dalla Sezione 4 sono ancora necessarie.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>I governatori repubblicani hanno firmato severe restrizioni sulla foto-identificazione nella legge come soluzione a un problema praticamente inesistente di impersonazione elettorale, ferendo in modo sproporzionato le donne, i giovani, le famiglie lavoratrici e la comunità afro-americana. È ingannevole per i repubblicani come Paul cercare i voti di queste comunità quando credono che "non c'è nulla di sbagliato" nell'imposizione di restrizioni che rendono più difficile per questi elettori votare.<br/><br/>I repubblicani hanno anche cercato di limitare i periodi di voto anticipato, tra cui la domenica prima del giorno delle elezioni, quando le chiese afro-americane hanno avuto un grande successo con i programmi Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Queste restrizioni rappresentano uno sforzo insensibile da parte dei repubblicani per rendere il voto più difficile, sulla base di calcoli politici ristretti e a breve termine che i repubblicani possono vincere le elezioni riducendo le dimensioni dell'elettorato.<br/><br/>I democratici hanno una missione molto diversa quando si tratta di votare: garantire che ogni elettore idoneo possa registrarsi, che ogni elettore registrato possa votare e che ogni voto sia accuratamente contato.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Il progetto di espansione degli elettori del Comitato Nazionale Democratico riflette la nostra convinzione che una maggiore partecipazione degli elettori rafforzi la nostra nazione e la nostra democrazia. Continueremo a usare le nostre impareggiabili conoscenze istituzionali per proteggere i diritti di voto contro la legislazione e le tattiche che tenterebbero di sopprimere il voto. E poiché la migliore difesa è un buon reato, stiamo anche lavorando per espandere il voto distribuendo la nostra tecnologia e le risorse di dati per registrare nuovi elettori.<br/><br/>In questo anniversario, uno dei modi migliori per onorare coloro che hanno lottato - e in alcuni casi hanno dato la loro stessa vita - per il passaggio della legislazione è che i repubblicani al Congresso si uniscano ai democratici nell'approvare il Voting Rights Amendment Act per ripristinare la promessa del Voting Rights Act del 1965.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, una democratica, rappresenta il 23 ° Distretto del Congresso della Florida nel Congresso degli Stati Uniti. Dal 2011, ha servito come presidente del Comitato Nazionale Democratico.

Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Domande e risposte: L’esperto vaticano di salvaguardia P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 giugno 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Immagine: Gesuiti australiani.<br/><br/>Il Presidente del Centro per la Protezione dell’Infanzia dell’Università Gregoriana di Roma e membro della Pontificia Commissione per la Protezione dei Minori, p. Hans Zollner SJ, era in Australia nel 2018 per parlare ai leader del ministero cattolico e ai sopravvissuti.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh della Jesuit Communications si è seduto con lui durante la visita per esplorare come la Chiesa sta rispondendo alla crisi degli abusi a livello internazionale e cosa possiamo imparare dalle nostre esperienze in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: Questo è il tuo terzo viaggio in Australia. Hai visitato molti altri paesi per vedere come la Chiesa sta rispondendo agli abusi in tutto il mondo. Puoi darci un'idea di come appare il quadro globale?<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: La mia comprensione, dopo aver visitato circa 50 paesi in cinque o sei continenti, è che la Chiesa sta davvero iniziando a muoversi negli ultimi due anni sulla questione di rendere giustizia alle vittime, di ascoltarle e di fare tutto ciò che può essere fatto in termini di salvaguardia.<br/><br/>Sono stato con i Gesuiti Provinciali di tutta l’Africa alla fine di aprile, e il Presidente dell’Assistenza Gesuita d’Africa e Madagascar è molto impegnato e dedicato a questo. Ha messo a punto un piano d'azione approfondito per la formazione e per l'introduzione di linee guida in tutto il luogo. È uno sforzo molto premuroso e molto deliberato fare tutto ciò che può essere fatto per impegnarsi in modo proattivo come gesuiti in Africa - in un continente dove fino a pochi anni fa tutto questo era una lingua straniera.<br/><br/>Una delle sfide di cercare di sviluppare questo approccio globale è che hai a che fare con così tante culture e così tante comprensioni diverse. Come si fa a mettere insieme questo e cercare di fornire formazione e sostegno alle comunità religiose che affrontano questi problemi?<br/><br/>Questa è una delle domande più importanti che abbiamo e credo che quello che posso fare è stimolare la discussione, stimolare la riflessione e preparare le persone il più possibile in modo che possano fare il lavoro di base.<br/><br/>Il Centro per la Protezione dell’Infanzia dell’Università Gregoriana non pretende di avere la risposta a ogni domanda. Non solo perché non conosciamo i contesti specifici - potremmo conoscerne alcuni, ma stiamo parlando di migliaia di culture, stiamo parlando di centinaia di lingue, stiamo parlando di background legali molto diversi. Varia anche a volte all'interno di un paese, come l'Australia in cui ci sono stati all'interno del Commonwealth dell'Australia che hanno leggi diverse rispetto ad altri stati.<br/><br/>Sono qualcuno che cerca di suscitare e stimolare la discussione e la riflessione. Sono anche molto felice di ascoltare le persone.<br/><br/>Ovviamente abbiamo avuto la Royal Commission qui in Australia, ma quali sono gli altri modi in cui avete visto che le voci delle vittime vengono sostenute in tutto il mondo?<br/><br/>In Francia c’è una diocesi che ha istituito quello che chiamano “Lo spazio dell’ascolto”, dove le vittime possono farsi avanti e possono esprimersi. Il vescovo è presente. È uno spazio aperto in cui le persone che sono state ferite tremendamente sono libere almeno di esprimere ciò che vogliono chiedere alla leadership della Chiesa, ecc.<br/><br/>Ci sono altri luoghi negli Stati Uniti o in altri paesi dove le vittime sono state invitate dalle diocesi, dalle province, dalla leadership della Chiesa, a farsi avanti. Devo dire che nel complesso penso che ci sia una buona volontà, e ci sono più persone come vescovi e provinciali che ascoltano le vittime di quanto sappiamo. Ma non esiste un unico modello per dare alle vittime non solo lo spazio per esprimersi ed essere ascoltate, ma anche per impegnarsi attivamente nello sviluppo della Chiesa.<br/><br/>In termini di creazione di spazi per il sostegno alle vittime, quali sono alcune delle cose che avete visto che potrebbero davvero aiutare - e che potremmo prendere in considerazione qui in Australia?<br/><br/>Uno dei punti principali che molte vittime sollevano è: 'Non possiamo avere, all'interno delle impostazioni parrocchiali, all'interno delle impostazioni scolastiche, una conversazione regolare in corso che include i sopravvissuti agli abusi come membri regolari di un comitato, una commissione, un comitato di risonanza, un gruppo di feedback o qualcosa del genere?' In modo che questa voce non sia solo introdotta in un'occasione specifica, o quando una persona si sente come se fosse al punto di essere in grado di parlarne, ma [si sente] su base regolare - costruire quella voce nel sistema.<br/><br/>Questo aiuterà tutti noi. Aiuterà i sopravvissuti e le vittime perché si sentiranno accolti e apprezzati nell’esperienza specifica, e nelle specifiche sfide di vita, che hanno attraversato. In secondo luogo, aiuterà la comunità in generale, perché possiamo almeno renderci sempre più sensibili a quali sono le preoccupazioni e le esigenze specifiche dei sopravvissuti, che possono anche parlare alle esigenze dei giovani.<br/><br/>M: Abbiamo forti gruppi di sopravvissuti qui in Australia che sono stati in grado di sostenersi a vicenda attraverso questo processo. Ma quello che sta dicendo è che abbiamo bisogno di un modo per sostenere questi gruppi, e sostenere queste persone, anche attraverso le nostre istituzioni?<br/><br/>E penso che dobbiamo essere creativi. Funzionerà per una scuola e una parrocchia e una diocesi in un modo, e per gli altri in un modo diverso. Perché i sopravvissuti con cui sono in costante contatto, hanno richieste molto simili, ed esperienze simili riguardo all’essere accolti nella Chiesa o meno – sentendosi buttati fuori o respinti. Ma anche loro hanno aspettative molto diverse tra loro, e ho imparato che anche voi dovete essere molto aperti nell'accettare le differenze in ciò che questo specifico gruppo, o questo specifico sopravvissuto, vuole, richiede e ha bisogno.<br/><br/>M: I sopravvissuti parlano di volere che le loro storie siano ascoltate e riconosciute. Abbiamo avuto la Royal Commission qui in Australia, che ha fornito un processo indipendente in cui le vittime potevano farsi avanti. C’è bisogno di qualcosa di simile in termini di un processo di verità, giustizia e riconciliazione per la Chiesa a livello internazionale?<br/><br/>H: Sì, penso che ci sia bisogno di questo a livello internazionale. Ma penso che prima ogni chiesa locale abbia bisogno di fare i suoi compiti. Non vedo accadere molto presto che qualche consiglio o commissione di questo tipo venga istituito per esaminare quest’area per tutta la Chiesa. La Chiesa conta 1,3 miliardi di membri ed è presente in 190 paesi, con ogni sorta di differenze nelle aspettative per quanto riguarda il sostegno psicologico, spirituale e finanziario.<br/><br/>C’è una cosa con cui mi sono imbattuto costantemente nel comunicare, lavorare e ascoltare le vittime, ed è che vogliono essere ascoltate. Quindi, se ci fosse la sensazione che le vittime siano costantemente ascoltate - a Roma e altrove - penso che questo darebbe un grande sollievo a molte vittime.<br/><br/>Penso che la preoccupazione [di Papa Francesco], specialmente per quanto riguarda la sua domanda, sia che le chiese locali facciano tutto il possibile perché le vittime siano ascoltate in quel particolare paese. Ho una lista di persone che vogliono parlare direttamente con il Santo Padre, e fisicamente è impossibile. Ero lì nel 2014 per tradurre per due sopravvissuti tedeschi che sono stati scelti con due sopravvissuti irlandesi e due inglesi quando ha ricevuto i sei a casa. Ha trascorso tutta la mattina ascoltandoli uno dopo l’altro. Per ogni sopravvissuto, era lì per 40 o 45 minuti, se lo facesse per ogni sopravvissuto che non riusciva più a dormire.<br/><br/>Il suo esempio è quello di modellare per tutta la Chiesa cattolica il modo in cui le vittime e i sopravvissuti sono accolti, accolti e ascoltati. Penso che se i vescovi e i provinciali di questo mondo, in tutti i paesi, avessero seguito il suo esempio, molti sopravvissuti ne sarebbero davvero grati.<br/><br/>L’arcivescovo Diarmoud Martin è stato recentemente citato poco prima dell’Incontro Mondiale delle Famiglie, a proposito della Pontificia Commissione, dicendo che è troppo piccola in quanto è attualmente istituita per raggiungere ciò che deve raggiungere. La Chiesa ha bisogno di mettere più risorse nel modo in cui sta supervisionando queste questioni?<br/><br/>Al momento siamo 16 membri provenienti da praticamente tutti i continenti e dai principali gruppi linguistici. Rappresentiamo una varietà di discipline e professioni, e lo scopo della commissione - come gli statuti che sono stati appena promulgati - è quello di fornire consigli al Santo Padre.<br/><br/>Un malinteso comune in merito alla Commissione è innanzitutto che ci occupiamo di casi di accuse, ma non è così. Non abbiamo alcun potere giuridico o amministrativo per quanto riguarda i casi, perché quando si tratta di accuse di abuso i tribunali e la procedura sono stabiliti.<br/><br/>Un secondo malinteso è che promuoviamo, direttamente, le cose sul terreno. Il nostro primo e principale obiettivo è quello di consigliare il Santo Padre su questioni.<br/><br/>Quindi, dal mio punto di vista, sì, dobbiamo investire di più. Ma dobbiamo investire di più a livello locale, e dobbiamo assicurarci che le proposte della Pontificia Commissione siano inoltrate al Santo Padre – come normalmente fa il Presidente – e poi c’è un processo di follow-up che riflette ciò che abbiamo dato come nostro consiglio.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited supervisiona la risposta della Chiesa e fornisce linee guida e supporto per garantire che tutte le istituzioni della Chiesa siano istituzioni sicure per i bambini. C’è bisogno di qualche tipo di sostegno organizzativo da parte di Roma per quei vescovi e diocesi che stanno lottando per formare queste istituzioni e garantire la salvaguardia in quelle diocesi?<br/><br/>Ritengo che alla fine la Commissione si svilupperà in questa direzione, e sono ora in procinto di assumere esperti in questi settori.<br/><br/>Penso che la Chiesa debba capire che le chiese locali possono imparare l’una dall’altra. E la mia comprensione è sempre stata – e penso che il Santo Padre ci abbia ricordato – che la Chiesa non funzionerà come una società centralizzata. Non funziona così, efficacemente. Ogni vescovo, ogni conferenza episcopale, ha, in una certa misura, la sua vita da sola. Quello che dobbiamo imparare di più è aprire canali di comunicazione reciproca.<br/><br/>Ci sono un certo numero di cose che le persone incolpano per gli abusi nella Chiesa. Come sacerdote e psicologo, e come qualcuno che ha incontrato e lavorato con i sopravvissuti, quali sono i tuoi pensieri su questo argomento?<br/><br/>Penso che la questione di da dove viene l’abuso sia la più importante, e il Papa l’ha affrontata nella sua lettera al popolo di Dio pubblicata il 20 agosto. Dice nel primo paragrafo, e lo ripete più volte, che la questione degli abusi sessuali è sempre – o quasi sempre – legata non solo alla questione dell’abuso di potere, ma anche all’abuso di coscienza.<br/><br/>Quindi la vera questione fondamentale dell’abuso è molto più complessa della semplice questione della sessualità – sia essa eterosessuale o omosessuale. È una questione di potere, e lì dobbiamo davvero lavorare sulla questione di come comprendiamo il sacerdozio, come comprendiamo il vescovato, come comprendiamo e viviamo i nostri ministeri? Quali sono i confini?<br/><br/>Ecco perché sono molto felice che la Provincia dei Gesuiti in Australia stia stabilendo un codice di condotta, perché non parliamo solo di abusi sessuali su minori. Parliamo di abusi sessuali sugli adulti, e parliamo di abusi in altri modi, come l'abuso di coscienza, in cui detti a qualcuno ciò che pensi, o fingi di sapere da Dio, e puoi dire ad un'altra persona, 'Devi farlo', contro la coscienza di quella persona.<br/><br/>Molte persone pensano che il celibato produca abusi. Come dico sempre, il celibato come tale non è motivo di abuso – altrimenti come spieghiamo che il 99,9 per cento di tutti gli abusatori non vive una vita di celibato, e come spieghiamo che il 95 o il 96 per cento di tutti i sacerdoti non abusano dei minori? Ma, il celibato, o un voto di castità, che non è realmente integrato, che non è realmente vissuto correttamente – sì, che produce un problema. A volte le persone prendono al bere, a volte prendono al gioco d'azzardo, e a volte prendono a cattiva condotta sessuale, con gli adulti e con i minori.<br/><br/>La vera domanda a questo proposito è: come affrontiamo la nozione di potere spirituale religioso di cui sono investiti sacerdoti e vescovi? Come può la teologia aiutarci a capire, e forse come può la sociologia, la psicologia o l’amministrazione aziendale aiutarci a definire i limiti del potere e la necessità di mantenere i propri confini? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Non sono sorpreso da questo disadattamento, anzi, direi che non è qualcosa che cambierà mai, né che dovremmo essere tutti impauriti di cambiarlo. Tra 10 anni, avremo ancora elementi complessi nella lista delle maggiori preoccupazioni, e le cose che finalmente riusciremo a capire saranno le parti principali della nostra spesa.<br/><br/>Ora, Gunnar e Andy hanno entrambi punti eccellenti, in particolare sui team IT che vedono i problemi IT e li risolvono con soluzioni IT; in effetti, sono sicuro che i loro punti valgano il merito.<br/><br/>Ma penso che ci siano altre idee che superano quelle (ho fatto commenti sui loro blog su di esso, e in seguito ho deciso che avrei dovuto solo blog qui). Quelle prime 3 preoccupazioni sono sanguinosamente nuove tali che:<br/><br/>temiamo cose nuove perché non le capiamo, o non le capiamo perché sono nuove.<br/><br/>sono troppo nuovi per noi per avere approcci solidi per gestirli.<br/><br/>sono troppo nuovi per noi per sapere se dovremmo essere preoccupati o no! tendiamo a default a paranoico / preoccupato, che è buono!<br/><br/>Posso acquistare una scatola o qualche software che fornisca "sicurezza del cloud" o "sicurezza dei social media"?<br/><br/>sono così nuovi che l'azienda non sa nemmeno come usarli o cosa vogliono da loro. Per non parlare di come possiamo proteggerli mentre ancora soddisfare o almeno non calpestare tutte le esigenze aziendali. Se l'azienda non sa ancora come usarli, non sono sicuro che la sicurezza sia in grado di guidare tale utilizzo in modo sicuro.<br/><br/>Va anche detto che queste nuove cose vengono in gran parte spinte attraverso il paese dei consumatori e nel business, con l'IT come una sorta di, "Oh sì," pensato. Firewall, AV, AM, Auth sono tutte risposte IT a problemi tipicamente IT. Naturalmente c'è una differenza. Sono anche problemi molto soggettivi, al contrario di oggetti molto oggettivi come firewall, noti bit dannosi, comportamenti, firme, porte. Gli affari presentano problemi molto complessi che spesso coinvolgono le persone (che non possiamo correggere) e che spesso non si adattano bene alle regole generali. Anche se ci siamo allontanati dalle soluzioni tecniche e abbiamo dedicato il nostro tempo a risolvere questi problemi, non saranno ancora risolti in modo ordinato. Allo stesso modo, quando si tratta di spingere, puoi avere e raggiungere gli obiettivi con i firewall? Puoi mostrare un miglioramento? Tutto questo deriva dall'aspetto non tecnico piuttosto soggettivo di quei problemi. Una sorta di differenza tra la scheda di rapporto di un bambino e il feedback che si ottiene da una conferenza genitori-insegnante. Se avete un figlio, quale sareste più inclini a non essere d’accordo o a non credere necessariamente? (La risposta è soggettiva!)<br/><br/>Si potrebbe dire che questa è la naturale progressione della sicurezza e della tecnologia: dal rafforzare i controlli tecnici al muoversi verso il comportamento e le persone. Certo, si può dire che queste 3 principali preoccupazioni colpiscono i firewall e i segmenti di rete, ma questa è la natura di quelle cose (il "punzonatura" dei social media attraverso un firewall è molto diverso da me punzonatura attraverso una connessione SSH per collegare la mia rete domestica; i social media è simile al * modo * uso la mia connessione SSH dopo che la presa è già utilizzata perché è necessaria; cioè i social media è la porta 80)<br/><br/>Fondamentalmente, tutte le indicazioni indicano che non siamo sorpresi da questa dicotomia. E non penso che questa sia un'ulteriore indicazione che IT / sicurezza sta facendo male, o non è allineato correttamente con il business, o ha un background tecnico di dark-server-room. Non sto dicendo che stiamo facendo le cose bene o che siamo adeguatamente allineati, ma quanto sopra non è un buon argomento a sostegno della teoria di queste carenze.<br/><br/>Ora, per fare un salto davvero grande, paragonerei l'attuale aumento del mobile computing con l'introduzione dei computer nel business e poi del PC/internet nel business. Ora, non ero in giro quando è successo il primo, né ero nel settore quando la rivoluzione del personal computer ha spazzato via il business, ma scommetto che questo è il paragone più vicino finora. Posso anche dire lo stesso per i social media. Questi sono dannatamente nuovi e sono grandi cambiamenti oltre a portare Mac o nuovi software o qualche nuovo processo di business. |
