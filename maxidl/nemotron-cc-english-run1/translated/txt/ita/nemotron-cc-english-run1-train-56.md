| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Pur riconoscendo che è impossibile convincere qualcuno ad amare qualcosa che odia, e viceversa, è ancora spesso piacevole provare a discutere. Quando parliamo con persone le cui opinioni contraddicono direttamente le nostre, siamo costretti a difendere i nostri gusti, definire le nostre opinioni e analizzare perché reagiamo nel modo in cui lo facciamo. Ecco perché abbiamo Why Don't You Like This?, in cui due dei nostri membri dello staff cercheranno di scoprire se le persone con opinioni opposte possono andare oltre "No, ti sbagli!" e avere una discussione civile, costruttiva e forse anche convincente sui loro punti di contesa. Perché non importa cosa dice la radio, c'è ancora una via di mezzo tra "Siamo assolutamente d'accordo" e "Ho ragione, e tu sei stupido e malvagio".<br/><br/>Scott: Da quando abbiamo discusso della mia apostasia di Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, abbiamo cercato un caso in cui potessi chiamarti perché non ti piaceva qualcosa di meraviglioso, e non abbiamo dovuto cercare a lungo. Eravamo seduti l'uno accanto all'altro durante Hugo di Martin Scorsese - me, del tutto incantato dal suo fantastico tributo alle meraviglie del cinema muto dei primi anni, e tu, apparentemente resistendogli ad ogni turno. Il consenso critico è stato dalla mia parte: ha raggiunto il 9 ° posto nella nostra Top 15 collettiva (anche se l'hai elencato come tua scelta sopravvalutata), ha vinto (o messo) in vari premi della critica cinematografica e attualmente gode di un punteggio di 83 su Metacritic. Questo non significa che ti sbagli, ovviamente, ma spetta a te spiegare perché Hugo era, nelle tue parole, "vuoto e artificiale", dove molti di noi lo vedevano come una bella evocazione dell'infanzia di Scorsese e del medium quando era ancora nella sua infanzia. E per favore siate gentili mentre strappate questa farfalla a pezzi per le ali.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Tasha: Non posso essere gentile, Scott. A volte fa meno male se si strappa il Band-Aid tutto in una volta. (E anche se non lo fa, chi vuole camminare in giro indossando un mezzo strappato-off Band-Aid? Gross.) Il fatto è che ho trovato Hugo un esercizio di manipolazione faticoso nella finzione, a partire dalla sua apertura scivolare attraverso una stazione ferroviaria di Parigi, che mi ha ricordato più di qualsiasi altra cosa di Robert Zemeckis 'The Polar Express. A differenza di Mike D'Angelo, sono un fan di lungo, ininterrotto prende come un modo di stabilire uno spazio e incoraggiare gli spettatori a trattenere inconsciamente il respiro come una macchina fotografica esplora un'area; ma quando lo spazio in fase di esplorazione è una creazione CGI liscia e lucida, e la fotocamera galleggia senza peso attraverso di esso senza alcun altro senso fisico che la fotocamera o l'ambiente di gioco di guardare sono davvero lì, che l'es E il resto del film mi sembrava altrettanto privo di pori e irreale, sia in termini di ambientazione che in termini di trama.<br/><br/>Non ho necessariamente un problema con gli ambienti fabbricati e stilizzati nel film. Mi è piaciuta la visione altrettanto estesa e del tutto artificiale di Baz Luhrmann su Parigi al Moulin Rouge, per esempio, ma quel film ha un senso del suo ridicolo, un senso dell’umorismo su quanto sia deliberatamente eccessivo. A differenza della stilizzazione di Jean-Pierre Jeunet, in particolare in Amélie (qui sia Jeunet che Luhrmann si sentivano come forti influenze visive), ho avuto la sensazione, tuttavia, che Martin Scorsese voleva che prendessi Hugo del tutto sul serio. Anche se e' un'altra storia sentimentale dolorosa su un orfano sfacciato che riporta il colore nella vita di un vecchio sfacciato, e non potevo.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Non c'è niente che mi diverta di più nel cinema che essere sorpreso, e non c'è niente che mi risentisca e resista di più che essere apertamente manipolato, essere detto ad alta voce cosa sentire e quando sentirlo. Un buon film fa questo tipo di cose in modo sottile; uno cattivo usa indizi musicali e stringhe dolci – e in questo caso, un orfano sporco, con gli occhi enormi e disordinato che guarda la macchina da presa – per esigere il pathos, e per dire agli spettatori che sono persone orribili se non lo servono su richiesta. Detto questo, posso trattare con bambini tristi e adulti scontrosi che migliorano la vita l'uno per l'altro - ho davvero scavato Le Havre di quest'anno, che era essenzialmente la stessa trama senza tutta la gentilezza - ma trovo che gli ambienti artificiali riflettono male sulle emozioni artificiali, e ognuno fa sembrare l'altro più falso a turno.<br/><br/>Iniziamo con questo. Nel nostro video di film trascurati, tu e Noel avete entrambi preso Keith per il compito di difendere Tyrannosaur, perché sentivi che non era abbastanza realistico - troppo inventato, troppo miserabile, troppo, troppo lontano. Come è possibile che non si possa comprare un vecchio manipolo che rompe le cose quando è arrabbiato, ma si può comprare un orfano che vive all'interno di un gigantesco orologio della stazione ferroviaria e intraprendere un viaggio capriccioso per riparare un misterioso automa che crede possa portare segreti da suo padre morto, ma che invece lo porta in un viaggio bizzarro di auto-scoperta, nella magica terra del cinema? Non hai mai trovato il design rococò di Hugo, l'aggressività delle stringhe del cuore o il carico di bizzarre carriole anche un po' eccessivo o difficile da ingoiare?<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet e Luhrmann come influenze su Scorsese?! Dimentica di essere indelicato, ora mi stai pungendo deliberatamente con un bastone affilato. Se stai cercando ispirazioni per Hugo, anzi, se stai cercando il nucleo emotivo di Hugo, devi tornare all'infanzia di Scorsese su Elizabeth Street a Little Italy, dove un ragazzino asmatico, incapace di giocare fuori con gli altri bambini, si è ritirato alle fantasie di Alexander Korda come The Thief Of Bagdad. O, più semplicemente, basta andare direttamente alla fonte stessa: George Méliès, il cui A Trip To The Moon rimane il Big Bang di tutte le fantasie cinematografiche, quel momento in cui la macchina fotografica non era usata per documentare il mondo così com’è, ma qualunque luogo fantasioso, magico, trasportante un regista voglia inventare per esso. E questa tradizione è stata sviluppata e ampliata per decenni prima che Jeunet e Luhrmann avessero le loro piccole zampe sporche.<br/><br/>E parlando di Jeunet, bel tentativo di togliermi la mia arma retorica, ma lo dirò comunque: come puoi amare Amélie, eppure trovare Hugo sintetico e "eccessivo" e "stanco manipolativo"? Voi dite che Amélie e Moulin Rouge hanno un senso redentore del ridicolo, dove Scorsese vuole che prendiamo Hugo sul serio, e non credo che sia così, almeno su quest’ultimo punto. Il fatto che Scorsese abbia una passione evidente per i film è, immagino, il motivo per cui lei interpreterebbe Hugo come se fosse serio con se stesso, ma per me, sono quei sentimenti che danno al film una zavorra emotiva che i film di Luhrmann e Jeunet non hanno. Tutti e tre i film fanno un uso aggressivo delle meraviglie del CGI - e Scorsese aggiunge 3D al mix, con un effetto meraviglioso - ma dove differiscono tu e io è sulla questione dell'assenza di peso. Concordo sul fatto che il CGI abbia un effetto di distanziamento; i mondi composti interamente da plasticina digitale sono flessibili al punto in cui a volte non hanno presenza. Hai fatto riferimento a Hugo nella tua voce "Overrated" per il nostro pezzo Best Of Film come "un gimcrack CGI" - un dis perfetto... per un altro film.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>È giusto dire che Scorsese ha costruito Hugo attorno a un libro/film per bambini standard: Orphan sente la mancanza di suo padre, crea il suo piccolo mondo di fantasia, si lamenta di un nuovo amico, convince un vecchio e croccante fuddy-duddy ad ammorbidirsi e forse adottarlo. Ma questo è solo lo scheletro narrativo, e Scorsese fornisce abbondanza di carne e ossa. Per prima cosa, non si può guardare Hugo, il ragazzo solitario, sbirciare fuori dalle torri dell'orologio al trambusto di una stazione ferroviaria di Parigi senza pensare a Scorsese, un altro ragazzo solitario, che guarda dalla finestra della sua camera da letto su Elizabeth Street. E anche se non sei un nerd del cinema abbastanza grande da fare quella connessione, sento davvero che il viaggio di Hugo non consiste nel trovare una nuova figura paterna, ma nel persistere con la magia meccanica che è l'eredità di suo padre. La persistenza della visione che ci permette di accettare una versione illusoria del mondo a 24 fotogrammi al secondo è scienza e magia allo stesso tempo. La relazione di Hugo con Méliès non riguarda il fatto che si sia trovato a dover sposare un nuovo papà, ma che condivide un entusiasmo comune che il vecchio ha immerso nell'amarezza. Per me, questo è un angolo molto più unico su una premessa potenzialmente usurata.<br/><br/>Anche i pochi detrattori del film sembrano disposti ad ammettere che le sequenze che evocano la storia del cinema e lo studio di Méliès - con Michael Stuhlbarg come eroico studioso cinematografico! - erano terrificanti. Sembrava, nel miglior modo possibile, come una compressione inebriante della mia classe di History Of Film 101 al college, condensando il valore di un semestre di clip e contesto in qualcosa tra un montaggio e un libro pop-up animato. E parla del design ingegnoso del film, che stratifica il fatto e la fantasia in modo così bello che è allo stesso tempo una storia di Méliès e la nascita del cinema, e solo la sorta di meraviglia cinematografica semplice, sontuosamente prodotta che Scorsese stesso avrebbe amato da bambino. Grazie a Dio Hugo non segue il modello Jeunet/Luhrmann e ha “un senso del proprio ridicolo”. Come intenditore di fantasy, non diresti che c'è un valore nel giocare dritto e serio e senza vergogna piuttosto che fare l'occhiolino al pubblico? Potresti trovare Hugo malatamente dolce, ma non credo che l'autenticità del suo sentimento sia da negare.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Tasha: Sì, in effetti ho trovato alcune parti di Hugo incantevoli. (Nota come sto rispondendo alla tua domanda in anticipo, mentre tu eri troppo impegnato a schiumare con l'apoplessia per affrontare la mia, anche se presumo che sia una risposta a sé stante. Ok, "influenza" potrebbe essere sopravvalutare il caso - volevo solo dire che lo stile visivo sembrava molto familiare. Anche se, come ha sottolineato Keith quando l'hai menzionato di persona, Scorsese non è né contrario all'ispirazione dalle immagini di altre persone, né immune ad essa.) Prima di tutto, sono stato incantato dalle parti che trattano del backstory di Georges Méliès, del suo amore per il cinema, del lavoro che ha messo nella sua arte e della gioia che ne ha tratto. C'è un sacco di bellezza e divertimento nella messa in scena della scena del campo sottomarino di "Fairyland" di Méliès, e nella sequenza alla fine, concentrandosi sulle riprese di Méliès. Vi ammetto che il legame di Hugo con Méliès per l'amore condiviso per il cinema è un bel tocco, e mi piace un buon film sul cinema.<br/><br/>Ma Hugo non è principalmente un film, nonostante i legami di Méliès. Oltre ai temi che citate, si tratta anche di trovare il vostro scopo, come i personaggi espressamente, laboriosamente spiegano l'un l'altro e a noi. E si tratta di spettacolo, e grandi pezzi d'azione, e inseguimenti, e finali felici e contenti dove anche il bullo arrabbiato e la timida coppia più anziana e fergawdsakes anche il dachshund irritabile tutti vengono abbinati con affascinanti interessi amorosi alla fine. Si tratta della super-precoce Hermione Granger-tipo di essere dominante e vivace e intelligente e lodare i mondi magici racchiusi nei libri. E tutta questa attività è molto familiare, e molto artificiale.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Sì, Scorsese sta giocando con gli archetipi. Il problema è, non ho mai sentito che li ha impregnati di qualcosa di nuovo, fresco o credibile, nonostante la sua storia. Avrei preferito di gran lunga una storia su un giovane Scorsese che cresceva con l’asma – qualcosa di piccolo e reale, senza vaste stanze piene di meccaniche CGI e palle di polvere dorate incandescenti e sogni profetici e una guardia tirannica adulta infuriata con un cuore d’oro – tutte quelle sciocchezze enormi e eccessive. Continui a citare il background personale di Scorsese e l'amore per il cinema come prova che sta davvero sentendo ciò che sta mettendo sullo schermo, ma non sento il suo tocco personale in tutto questo, tranne i momenti che sono espressamente sul cinema. Le emozioni principali possono essere reali, ma ciò non rende l'esecuzione meno falsa.<br/><br/>Lei dice che l'autenticità dell'emozione non deve essere negata. Non mi domando se Scorsese si sentisse personalmente solo e isolato da bambino, ma non mi sento la solitudine e l'isolamento sullo schermo - vedo un sacco di significanti esagerati (Hugo è sporco e i suoi vestiti sono indossati e tutti gli adulti gli urlano contro e viene regolarmente inseguito da un cane spaventoso!) e grandi battiti, con grida e lacrime e Spielberg Per me, la sincerità è più convincente e più personale quando è tranquilla e diretta; quando qualcuno grida le sue opinioni contro di me, suppongo che sia davvero arrabbiato, o semplicemente cerca di sopraffare i miei sensi per impedirmi di esprimere la mia opinione. Hugo era un grido lungo, per quanto mi riguardava.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Perche' non ho avuto quel senso di falsita' da Amelie, mi chiedi? Riconoscerò completamente che Amélie e Moulin Rouge sono entrambe costruzioni grandi, manipolative, artificiali nella stessa vena, esigendo emozioni specifiche a intervalli specifici e cercando di vendere quelle emozioni con forti emozioni e colonne sonore aggressive. Nessuno di loro mi ha davvero venduto le loro emozioni come autentico sentimento umano. Quello che mi è piaciuto in quei due film è stata la costruzione, in particolare le inebrianti e ridicole liste di caratteristiche ed esperienze casuali di Amélie per il suo cast, e i mashup e le ricontestualizzazioni musicali di Moulin Rouge. Sono spesso venduto su storie che fanno cose creative o ambiziose con la struttura, e entrambi quei film si qualificano, dove Hugo è una ricerca per bambini molto più lineare e standard.<br/><br/>Ma alla fine, per me, arriva davvero alla sensazione che quei film siano sciocchi, mentre Hugo è destinato a essere preso sul serio in ogni momento. Non pensi che sia vero, ma allo stesso tempo stai difendendo la sua integrità in termini di emozione assolutamente autentica, radicata nella storia di Scorsese, e mi stai dicendo che ho torto, e lui non vuole che sia preso sul serio. Come si conciliano queste due affermazioni? Che cosa suggerisce il film che non è destinato ad essere preso a valore nominale? Ed è possibile che questa sia solo un'altra situazione simile a quella del Curious Case Of Benjamin Button in cui trovo che l'uso dei bambini nei film di grande budget sia in gran parte sappy e melodrammatico, mentre tu come padre lo trovi bypassa il tuo cinismo e va dritto al tuo sentimento di famiglia?<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Scott: Non sono sicuro di voler dire che Scorsese non voglia essere preso sul serio; è solo che ha scelto un veicolo fantasioso attraverso il quale esprimere un serio amore per i film. Quando dici: "Ma Hugo non è principalmente un film, nonostante i legami di Méliès", sono perplesso. Vi concedo che troviate molti elementi di Hugo eccessivamente familiari e laboriosi e pieni di emozione per le meraviglie di Spielberg – non c’è nulla che io possa fare per argomentare intorno a quella percezione, che altri dubbisti di Hugo condividono. A volte un film vuol dire affascinare e incantare, e per alcuni no; avete Hugo e io ho Amélie, anche se penso che quest’ultima, per quanto deliberatamente artificiale sia, significhi per noi trovarla romantica. (Piuttosto che, diciamo, qualche orribile aggeggio meccanico adatto per un sequel di Saw.)<br/><br/>Ma dire che Hugo non è principalmente un film? Se non è un film, allora è la storia più inutilmente discorsiva su [qualunque cosa tu pensi che sia] che abbia mai visto. Il rapporto tra Hugo e Méliès è il cuore del film, e al centro di questo non c’è solo una connessione di stock tra Plucky Orphan e Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, ma un’affinità condivisa per la magia ingegnerizzata, in particolare la magia dei film. Penso che Scorsese e i suoi collaboratori abbiano trovato un modo per esprimere il loro entusiasmo nei primi giorni del cinema attraverso una fantasia accessibile a tutte le età. Il racconto per bambini pieno di archetipi è solo la crosta qui; il cinema è la torta. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Per quanto riguarda The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, non vedo molto di una connessione, oltre a cercare di espormi come difensore di Benjamin Button come un modo per danneggiare la mia credibilità. (A proposito, come sono gli extra su quel G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Ti ho detto che il mio nuovo padre, privo di sonno, era forse vulnerabile a Benjamin Button, ma non riesco a immaginare un momento in cui la premessa dell'invecchiamento al contrario non mi commuova. E inoltre, non vedo come Benjamin Button si riferisca molto a Hugo come a un film che riguarda i bambini, dal momento che questo è solo un piccolo segmento di una storia che si estende su una traiettoria molto più ampia.<br/><br/>Quindi vi ho convinto? Probabilmente no. Ma sono felice di sapere che Hugo non era del tutto privo di incantesimi per voi. Le sequenze su Méliès il regista sono ciò che ha messo Hugo per me - e in questo, almeno, possiamo condividere un po 'd'amore per il cinema.<br/><br/>Pubblicità<br/><br/>Tasha: No, non posso dire che tu mi abbia convinto, più di quanto non ti abbia convinto io. È impossibile convincere qualcuno di un amore viscerale per qualsiasi cosa, e dovrebbe essere altrettanto impossibile convincere qualcuno di un amore viscerale. Soprattutto, mi avete fatto vedere Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, che è un'esperienza interessante; almeno ora sono lievemente convinto che non siamo riusciti in qualche modo a vedere film completamente diversi che in qualche modo avevano entrambi lo stesso nome e regista.<br/><br/>Abbiamo avuto sicuramente esperienze diverse, però, e a mio parere, focalizzati su diversi aspetti della produzione: non vedo ancora il tema "il film è meraviglioso" come il singolo filo del film, tanto quanto uno tra troppi. "Pointlessly discursive" quasi lo copre, anche se lanciavo "spesso inutilmente gentile e prezioso" in cima a quello. Mentre ti concentri sul gustoso ripieno della torta del film, sento che quella torta è stata coperta con una libbra di zucchero cristallizzato, e penso che faccia la differenza, indipendentemente dal messaggio principale del film o da una manciata di scene terrificanti. Vedi anche Benjamin Button, che non ho citato solo per sgridarti: penso davvero che tu abbia più di una striscia sentimentale rispetto a me riguardo ai bambini nel cinema, specialmente quando sono usati più come simboli di vulnerabilità e innocenza che come personaggi umani. Ehi, sai quale film non ha assolutamente dei simpatici burattini dagli occhi larghi che portano speranza in un mondo cinico? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Forse andrò a guardare quegli extra in Blu-ray. Potrei usare un po 'd'insulina esplosione per compensare la dolcezza di Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Speravo che mia figlia sarebbe stata libera da tempi difficili e preoccupanti": la storia di Mee Mee come mamma rifugiata<br/><br/>Speranza in tempi di crisi: una storia della festa della mamma<br/><br/>Scritto da Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee ha sentito che i soldati stavano arrivando. Ha afferrato suo figlio e freneticamente si è unita al resto degli abitanti del villaggio che stavano correndo verso il confine thai-birmano, dove si trovava l’Ufficio dell’Alto Commissariato delle Nazioni Unite per i Rifugiati (UNHCR). Dopo la fine dell'inseguimento dei soldati, Mee tornò a casa nel suo piccolo villaggio di Koechi, in Birmania.<br/><br/>Durante il 1997-2000, Mee e migliaia come lei hanno vissuto sotto la costante minaccia di violenza da parte dei soldati birmani. Molte persone si rifugiavano temporaneamente nella giungla e tornavano a casa nel loro villaggio dopo che i soldati avevano lasciato la zona, solo per rifare tutto giorni dopo. Circa una volta alla settimana, Mee e altri sarebbero stati in movimento per evitare la cattura, lo stupro o la morte da parte dei soldati.<br/><br/>Durante un incidente, il marito di Mee corse davanti a sua moglie per procurarsi da mangiare per la sua famiglia. Suo marito fu avvistato dai soldati e fucilato. Il proiettile ha frantumato una parte della sua gabbia toracica, lasciandolo gravemente ferito e in difficoltà mentre viaggiava verso la giungla con la sua famiglia per la sicurezza.<br/><br/>Per tre mesi, il marito di Mee si nascose e trasferì la famiglia con una ferita esasperante al suo fianco. Non ricevette cure mediche, tranne che per la cura di Mee.<br/><br/>"Ho avuto paura di tornare in Birmania", ha detto Mee attraverso un interprete. "Ho avuto paura di morire. Piangevo e piangevo ogni giorno", ha continuato.<br/><br/>Il marito di Mee alla fine ha raccolto abbastanza forza per camminare cinque giorni verso un piccolo villaggio in Thailandia dove hanno imparato la posizione di un ospedale e un campo profughi. Quando Mee e suo marito sono finalmente arrivati in ospedale, ha subito un intervento chirurgico immediato e in seguito si è ripreso.<br/><br/>Simbolo di speranza<br/><br/>La vita nella giungla per i soldati birmani in fuga era davvero terrificante e difficile. Tende di bambù improvvisate con solo tetti e pavimenti divennero abitazioni temporanee adatte. Molte donne, tra cui Mee, diedero alla luce bambini nella giungla. Il figlio di Mee, allora di sei anni, ha assistito al parto di sua sorella di nome Eh Ku Hser. Il suo nome significa amore – freddo – dolce. "Freddo" nella cultura birmana significa in modo da non passare attraverso il fuoco della vita, poiché il calore rappresenta i tempi difficili.<br/><br/>"Speravo che mia figlia sarebbe stata libera da momenti difficili e preoccupanti", ha detto Mee. "Non volevo che lei passasse attraverso ciò che avevo sperimentato", ha continuato.<br/><br/>Per Mee, la nascita di sua figlia in mezzo alle tenebre, ai tormenti e alla paura, era un simbolo di speranza per una nuova vita a venire. Speranza in tempi di crisi, la premessa stessa della nuova candela UMCOR-Prosperity della United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), è anche l’essenza di ciò su cui le candele gettano luce.<br/><br/>Un nuovo inizio<br/><br/>Con l'aiuto dell'UNHCR, la speranza di una nuova vita si è effettivamente materializzata per Mee e la sua famiglia quando si sono reinsediati a West Springfield, nel Massachusetts. Lì, Mee ha incontrato Moo Kho Paw, un’altra donna emigrata dalla Birmania, che lavorava presso Prosperity Candle a Firenze. L’organizzazione aiuta le donne rifugiate che sono fuggite da aree di conflitto a ricostruire la loro vita attraverso l’arte di fare candele. Moo Kho raccomandò a Mee di unirsi all'organizzazione, e Mee accettò volentieri.<br/><br/>"Ero entusiasta di essere fuori di casa", ha detto Mee, "sono stata cresciuta per credere che perché ero una donna, il mio ruolo era quello di rimanere a casa e crescere la mia famiglia", ha continuato. “Mentre molte donne birmane vogliono fare di più per se stesse, sono spesso incoraggiate a rimanere casalinghe”.<br/><br/>Oggi, Mee ha intenzione di entrare nel settore della produzione di candele per se stessa e sostenere i suoi cinque figli, ma ha espresso la necessità di imparare l'inglese prima.<br/><br/>"Nel campo profughi thailandese, avevamo un'istruzione, ma non era così buona", ha detto Mee. "Quando ero bambino, volevo andare a scuola, ma mi è stato detto di rimanere a casa perché ero una donna. Ora, ho speranze per le mie figlie di andare al college e diventare medici o poliziotte ", ha continuato Mee.<br/><br/>Mee ha raggiunto un equilibrio uniforme nella sua vita che vorrebbe che gli altri avessero trovato: una vita semplice e felice in cui il lavoro, la cura dei membri della famiglia e la libertà di scelta hanno tutti il loro posto.<br/><br/>Sostenere le donne rifugiate negli Stati Uniti<br/><br/>Condividi questa storia della Festa della Mamma con i tuoi cari. E, quando acquisti candele fatte a mano da Mee, Moo Kho e Naw, un’altra donna rifugiata birmana che lavora alla Prosperity Candle, sai che stai aiutando a sostenere il loro sostentamento mentre ricostruiscono la loro vita e quella dei loro familiari negli Stati Uniti. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

L'azione affermativa è il risultato del movimento per i diritti civili degli anni '60, derivante dal Civil Rights Act del 1964 che ha vietato la discriminazione basata su razza, etnia o genere. È stata la decisione della Corte Suprema del 1978, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, che ha permesso l'uso delle preferenze basate sulla razza come mezzo per promuovere la diversità, consentendo l'azione affermativa da utilizzare nelle politiche di ammissione. E 'stato creato con l'intenzione di fornire pari opportunità per i membri dei gruppi di minoranze in materia di istruzione e istruzione.<br/><br/>Tuttavia, secondo un rapporto del 2007 del Pew Research Center, il sostegno all'azione affermativa tra il pubblico americano è in realtà aumentato sostanzialmente negli ultimi anni, passando dal 58% nel 1995 al 70% nel 2007. I sostenitori dell'azione affermativa fanno molti argomenti a sostegno dell'azione affermativa, nella speranza di far vedere agli altri il vero bene che le politiche di azione affermativa portano alla nostra società. I sostenitori ritengono che l'azione affermativa sia più un processo che una politica di ammissione. Collegi e università prendono l'iniziativa in più per raggiungere i gruppi di minoranza, incoraggiandoli a candidarsi. I college e le università offrono un aiuto finanziario aggiuntivo e forniscono risorse sul campus per aiutare a migliorare l'istruzione universitaria dello studente. I sostenitori hanno anche notato il crescente numero di domande di minoranza a college e università a causa in parte delle politiche di azione affermativa.<br/>Le statistiche hanno dimostrato che quando l'azione affermativa viene eliminata, come quando era al Berkley College e UCLA nel 1998, le ammissioni degli studenti di minoranza sono diminuite rispettivamente del 61% e del 36%, dimostrando che l'azione affermativa svolge un ruolo importante nel processo di ammissione degli studenti di minoranza. I sostenitori dell'azione affermativa credono anche che la diversità nell'istruzione superiore fornisca un'atmosfera educativa migliore per tutti gli studenti, personalmente e intellettualmente. Se l'azione affermativa dovesse essere eliminata, ci sarebbero meno studenti di minoranza iscritti alle università, causando la diversità di essere abbastanza sottile. Le politiche di azione affermativa sono anche necessarie per compensare secoli di oppressione razziale, economica e sociale. Gli individui con uno status socioeconomico più elevato hanno più opportunità rispetto a quelli con un background socioeconomico più basso. I sostenitori ritengono che alcuni gruppi razziali o etnici siano svantaggiati perché si trovano frequentemente in famiglie a basso reddito e, di conseguenza, non sono esposti alle stesse risorse degli studenti delle classi socioeconomiche più elevate. I sostenitori sostengono la nozione di concorrenza tra studenti basata sul merito, ma sostengono che l'azione affermativa compensa le differenze economiche. I laureati, che hanno beneficiato dell'azione affermativa, hanno anche detto di aver ricevuto lavori migliori, guadagnato più soldi e, nel complesso, vivere una vita migliore a causa delle opportunità fortunate che hanno ricevuto attraverso l'azione affermativa.<br/>I sostenitori dell'azione affermativa sottolineano continuamente la grave importanza dell'azione affermativa, considerando i suoi contributi a migliorare sia l'esperienza universitaria che la società in generale. Tuttavia, gli oppositori dell'azione affermativa ritengono che sia giunto il momento di porre fine all'azione affermativa. Gli oppositori ritengono che l'azione affermativa sia stata creata per garantire pratiche di ammissione eque per portare il cambiamento a un lungo periodo di discriminazione razziale. Credono che la politica sia obsoleta.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinazioni<br/><br/>Le combinazioni sono difese contro un pugno, risposte coreografate a diversi tipi di attacchi. Hanno molti nomi in tutte le arti marziali, ma (per la mia esperienza) ogni arte ha una versione di loro. Questo li rende diversi dalle forme perché ci sono un sacco di arti marziali che non hanno forme. Cosa rende gli esercizi del partner così universali? Perché praticare una risposta specifica quando (in realtà) la tempistica, il tipo di attacco, la dimensione dell'attaccante e un centinaio di altri fattori lo renderanno in modo da non utilizzare mai l'intera risposta coreografata? E infine, come possiamo praticare per una vera situazione di difesa ed evitare lesioni allo stesso tempo?<br/><br/>L'universalità delle combinazioni è impressionante, a dir poco. Il nostro stile di Kenpo karate ha una lista di 108 combo che possono essere imparati. (La maggior parte degli studenti impara solo 20-30 però) Nel Jiu-Jitsu brasiliano trascorri intere lezioni praticando le barre delle braccia e gli strozzamenti, imparando ogni sottigliezza alla mossa mentre il tuo partner offre poca o nessuna resistenza. Ogni pugile ha trascorso ore davanti alla borsa e / o allo specchio lanciando la stessa combinazione di pugni fino a quando il loro corpo si muove da solo con il riflesso. Le combinazioni sono universali perché non abbiamo un modo migliore per introdurre il movimento e poi praticare le posizioni sottili necessarie per farle funzionare. Colpire un piccolo punto di pressione attraverso l'abbigliamento richiede MOLTA pratica, prendere una barra del braccio con il controllo richiede un'anca accuratamente posizionata e una configurazione furtiva, e una grande combinazione è utile solo se puoi attraversarla da una posizione equilibrata e protetta. Riesci a pensare a un modo migliore per acquisire queste abilità?<br/><br/>Ci sono un certo numero di fattori che determinano come si risponde a un attacco e se in un incontro di sparring o in un combattimento, non ho mai usato una combinazione completa in mia difesa. Perché, allora, passiamo ore a praticarli? Pratichiamo queste risposte coreografate perché l'obiettivo non è tirare fuori la combinazione 8 ogni volta che vedi un pugno a gancio, ma mostrarti un modo per bloccarlo e poi un modo possibile per seguirlo. Non ho mai scelto di utilizzare la combinazione 3 in una situazione di realtà, ma il blocco è una delle mie mosse go-to. Le combinazioni aggiungono strumenti alla cassetta degli attrezzi non fissano l'auto.<br/><br/>L'ultima domanda è una questione di sicurezza. Se pratichiamo per il bene della realtà dobbiamo replicare la realtà. Come possiamo prevenire lesioni mentre lo facciamo? Quando si tratta di costruire fiducia. Iniziamo lentamente e impariamo a fidarci che abbiamo il controllo su noi stessi. Impariamo a fidarci che anche i nostri partner abbiano il controllo. Più a lungo impariamo a fidarci del nostro controllo sul nostro partner e (un po 'più spaventoso) impariamo a fidarci del controllo del nostro partner su di noi. Alla fine (con molta pratica) puoi muoverti a tutta velocità, lanciando il tuo partner e venendo gettato senza paura di lesioni.<br/><br/>Le combinazioni sono universali per un motivo; sono praticate in modo che possano essere sezionate nelle loro parti, e rimaniamo al sicuro iniziando lentamente e costruendo fiducia. Come con tutto il resto nelle arti marziali, le combinazioni hanno molte ragioni dietro la loro pratica ed esecuzione. |
