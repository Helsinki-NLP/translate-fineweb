Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigazione post<br/><br/>“Life Without Papers” vince il premio per la migliore sceneggiatura<br/><br/>Il progetto del blog, "Life Without Papers", creato da Len Grant, presenta storie di famiglie e giovani migranti senza documenti. I migranti senza documenti non hanno nulla. Non sono autorizzati a lavorare. Non hanno diritto alle prestazioni statali né a un posto in cui vivere. Sono invisibili e potenzialmente il gruppo più vulnerabile nel Regno Unito oggi.<br/><br/>I migranti senza documenti (o irregolari) includono coloro che sono stati trafficati nel commercio sessuale o per la servitù domestica; includono i visti in ritardo; coloro le cui domande di asilo sono state rifiutate e altri che sono stati soggetti a fallimenti nel sistema di immigrazione. Tutti questi possono originariamente essere arrivati nel Regno Unito legalmente.<br/><br/>Gli “immigrati illegali” – quelli immaginati per essere entrati nel paese nel retro di camion – costituiscono una piccola percentuale degli indocumentati.<br/><br/>In effetti, alcune fonti suggeriscono che la metà dei 120.000 bambini senza documenti stimati nel Regno Unito sono effettivamente nati qui da genitori senza documenti. Questi bambini sono svantaggiati dalla nascita, solo a causa del loro status di immigrazione.<br/><br/>Il blog racconta le storie degli indocumentati. Evidenzia le loro lotte e vulnerabilità quotidiane, ma anche la loro forza e resilienza. Non è una lettura facile.<br/><br/>È possibile accedere al blog tramite il nostro sito web (in basso a destra colonna sulla home page).<br/><br/>Il blog ha vinto la categoria online dei premi media Speaking Together. I premi sono stati una nuova aggiunta quest'anno alla celebrazione dei Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards alla Royal Festival Hall di Londra come parte della Giornata internazionale della donna. Il panel di giudici – tra cui la romanziere e drammaturga Gillian Slovo e la giornalista e autrice Hannah Pool – era particolarmente alla ricerca di lavori che sfidassero miti e stereotipi.<br/><br/>Il blog ha anche vinto i Blog North Awards 2013 nella categoria Best Writing ed è stato anche selezionato per un Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Lezione della Scuola Sabbatica<br/><br/>In Galati, Paolo affronta questioni come la libertà, il ruolo della legge nella salvezza, la nostra condizione in Cristo e la natura della vita guidata dallo Spirito, così come la secolare domanda: Come possono gli uomini peccatori essere resi giusti davanti a un Dio santo e giusto?<br/><br/>Molti studiosi credono che Galati potrebbe essere la prima delle lettere di Paolo. E 'stato scritto nel 49 dC, poco dopo il famoso Concilio di Gerusalemme (Atti 15). Pertanto, il libro può essere il più antico documento cristiano conosciuto. Come Atti e Galati chiariscono, la chiesa primitiva si trovò in una feroce battaglia sulla natura della salvezza, specialmente nel caso dei Gentili. Secondo un gruppo di credenti ebrei, noti come giudaizzatori, la fede in Gesù da solo non era abbastanza buona per i Gentili. Anche i Gentili devono essere circoncisi e seguire le leggi di Mosè (Atti 15:1).<br/><br/>La guida di studio biblico di questo trimestre ci invita a viaggiare con l'apostolo Paolo mentre supplica i Galati di rimanere fedeli a Gesù. Ci dà anche la possibilità di riflettere sulla nostra comprensione delle verità che hanno aperto la strada per la rottura definitiva di Martin Lutero con Roma e il restauro del Vangelo biblico. |

Quando Charlotte aveva dodici anni, sua madre morì e fu cresciuta dalla sorella di sua madre, Charlotte, che sposò suo padre nel 1784 e le sue sorelle furono portate dalla nonna, Maria Luisa Albertina di Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg a Darmstadt. Il 3 settembre 1785, all'età di quindici anni, Carlotta sposò il duca Federico, duca di Sassonia-Altenburg, il matrimonio non fu felice, Carlotta era mentalmente superiore a Federico, che iniziò a ignorarla. Avevano anche problemi, Sassonia-Hildburghausen era stata finanziariamente rovinata dalle politiche disastrose dei predecessori di Federico. I ricevitori consentirono al duca e alla duchessa solo una ridotta lista civile, il padre e i due fratelli di Carlotta soggiornarono spesso con Carlotta a Hildburghausen. Nel 1787, la sua trasferì a Hildburghausen in modo permanente e divenne presidente del comitato di credito. Nel 1792, la nonna di Charlotte e le sue sorelle fuggirono da Darmstadt a Hildburghausen di fronte all'avanzata dell'esercito francese e sua nonna notò il marito di Charlotte. Charlotte, che non ha mai amato quest'uomo, è sempre incinta, la famiglia ha trascorso diverse settimane spensierate a Hildburghausen. Nel 1793, la nonna di Charlotte tornò dall'esilio e viaggiò con le sorelle di Charlotte a Francoforte sul Meno, Charlotte ebbe una relazione molto intima e amorevole con sua sorella Friederike e i parenti a Strelitz. Nel 1803 e 1805, la coppia reale prussiana visitò Hildburghausen, per questa occasione, i ricevitori permisero alla coppia ducale di rinnovare alcuni dei loro mobili. Louise aveva aiutato a redigere la dichiarazione di guerra, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg era un amico della coppia ducale e padrino del figlio di Charlotte Edward. Molti spettatori erano venuti a vedere la principessa ereditaria bavarese, quando Truchseß ha ricevuto i suoi ospiti, ha cercato di condurre la Charlotte inferiore prima nel suo castello, ma lei ha rifiutato, riferendosi a sua figlia. Truchseß rispose: "Vostra Altezza mi perdonerà, ma finché questo castello è rimasto qui, Teresa afferrò l'altro braccio dei baroni, e i tre camminarono insieme attraverso la porta. La duchessa diede circa la metà del suo reddito ai poveri, pensionati<br/><br/>- 1617.<br/>Carlo d'Assia-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Il principe Carlo d'Assia-Kassel era un membro cadetto della casa di Assia-Kassel e un generale di campo danese. Cresciuto con parenti alla corte danese, trascorse la maggior parte della sua vita in Danimarca e sua madre era figlia del re Giorgio II di Gran Bretagna e di Carolina di Ansbach e sorella della regina Luisa di Danimarca. Suo padre, il futuro landgrave, lasciò la famiglia nel 1747, nel 1755 terminò formalmente il matrimonio con Maria. Il nonno, Guglielmo VIII, landgrave d'Assia, concesse la contea di Hanau e le sue entrate a Maria, il giovane principe Carlo e i suoi due fratelli, Guglielmo e Federico, furono allevati dalla madre e promossi da parenti protestanti dal 1747. Nel 1756, Maria si trasferì in Danimarca, per prendersi cura dei figli minori di sua sorella, la regina Luisa di Danimarca. Con lei, ha preso i suoi figli che sono stati allevati alla corte di Christiansborg Palace a Copenaghen. I principi dell'Assia in seguito rimasero in Danimarca, diventando i suoi importanti signori, solo il fratello maggiore Guglielmo tornò in Assia, nel 1785, dopo l'ascesa del landgraviato. Nel 1758 fu nominato colonnello, all'età di 20 anni generale maggiore, sempre nel 1766, fu nominato governatore generale della Norvegia, posizione che ricoprì fino al 1768 ma che rimase per lo più titolare, in quanto non andò mai in Norvegia durante questo periodo. Nel 1763, suo fratello maggiore Guglielmo sposò il loro cugino di primo grado, Carlo seguì l'esempio il 30 agosto 1766 a Christiansborg Palace - sua moglie era Luisa di Danimarca, e Carlo divenne così cognato di suo cugino, il re Cristiano VII. Il matrimonio ebbe luogo nonostante i consigli dati contro di esso, a causa delle accuse di dissolutezza da parte del principe Carlo. Poco dopo, Carlo cadde in disgrazia a corte, e all'inizio del 1767 lui e loro avrebbero avuto la loro prima figlia, Marie Sophie, lì nel 1767 e poi il loro secondo figlio, William, nel 1769. Nel 1768, Carlo acquistò la proprietà e il villaggio di Offenbach-Rumpenheim dalla famiglia Edelsheim. Nel 1771 fece espandere il maniero in un castello e sede principesca e sua madre Maria visse nel palazzo fino alla sua morte nel 1772. Nel 1781, Carlo vendette il palazzo di Rumpenheim al fratello minore, Carlo si stabilì al castello di Gottorp nello Schleswig con la sua famiglia. Hanno avuto il loro terzo figlio Federico nel 1771, nel 1770, il re Cristiano VII ha dato a sua sorella la tenuta di Tegelhof a Güby tra la città di Schleswig e Eckernförde. Dal 1772 al 1776, Carlo fece costruire una residenza estiva sul sito che chiamò Louisenlund in onore di sua moglie, nel settembre 1772, Carlo fu nominato comandante in capo dell'esercito norvegese e lui e Louise si trasferirono a Christiana. L'assegnazione fu una conseguenza del colpo di stato del re Gustavo III di Svezia il 19 agosto 1772, mentre in Norvegia, la principessa Luisa diede alla luce il loro quarto figlio Juliane nel 1773.<br/><br/>Diciotto.<br/>Luisa Carolina d'Assia-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline nacque a Gottorp nel ducato di Schleswig dal landgrave Carlo d'Assia-Kassel e da sua moglie la principessa Louise di Danimarca.<br/>–<br/>Principessa Louise Caroline<br/><br/>Diciannove.<br/>Federico d'Assia<br/>–<br/>Federico I di Prussia<br/><br/>Venti.<br/>Guglielmo d'Assia<br/>–<br/>Guglielmo d'Assia-Kassel<br/><br/>- 212223.<br/>Principessa Louise24.<br/>Sofia Federico di Meclemburgo-Schwerin<br/>–<br/>Sophia Frederica di Me252627 materna28.<br/>Alberto Azzo II, Margravio di Milano<br/>–<br/>Alberto Azzo II, Margravio di Milano, e Liguria, Conte di Gavello e Padova, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice, e Montagnana, aka, Albertezzo II, fu un potente nobile nel Sacro Romano Impero.

Egli ereditò gli uffici dei suoi padri intorno al 1020, e continuò ad aumentare le sue proprietà nel nord Italia, nel 1069-1070, cercò di acquisire il Maine per suo figlio Ugo, perché sua moglie, Garsende, era una coerede dei precedenti conti del Maine. Ugo fu dichiarato conte, ma non poté vincere contro Roberto, il duca di Normandia, nella Controversia d'investitura tra Enrico IV, imperatore del Sacro Romano Impero, e Papa Gregorio VII, Azzo tentò di mediare, ma in seguito si unì alla parte del papa. Intorno al 1073 fece di Este un castello la sua residenza, da cui la Casa di Este, prima del suo progetto di costruzione, Este era poco più di un villaggio.

Welf era figlio di Azzo II d'Este e di sua moglie Kunigunde di Altdorf, quando lo zio materno di Welf, Welf, duca di Carinzia, morì senza figli, Welf ereditò la sua proprietà. Welf sposò Ethelinde di Northeim, figlia di Ottone II, duca di Baviera, quando suo suocero, il duca Ottone era diventato nemico di re Enrico IV e aveva perso il suo ducato, Welf rimase fedele al re. In ottemperanza agli ordini di Enrico, ripudia e divorzia la sua duchessa, Ethelinde e questo evento si svolse a Goslar nel 1070, quando gli Stati di Baviera si sottomisero tranquillamente al nuovo duca, che era il rappresentante di una delle famiglie più antiche della provincia. Il suo ripudio della duchessa, che avrebbe potuto essere considerato un atto di ingiustizia. Papa e imperatore furono riconciliati superficialmente nel 1076, ma l'anno li vide di nuovo impegnati in ostilità attive. Enrico, a seguito di ripetuti atti di ribellione, dichiarò Welfo deposto nel suo ducato appena acquisito. Tuttavia, sostenuto dai suoi fedeli bavaresi, e aiutato da suo padre in Italia, Welf fu in grado di mantenere il suo posto, tuttavia, Gregorio morì nel 1085 e i suoi successori presero una parte meno intensa negli affari della Germania. Welf, anche se ancora aderente al partito della chiesa, dopo il divorzio, nel 1070, dalla sua prima moglie, Welf sposò Giuditta di Fiandre, figlia di Baldovino IV, conte di Fiandre, e la vedova di Tostig Godwinson, conte di Northumbria. Nel 1089, Welf, figlio di Welf, sposò Matilde di Toscana, rafforzando così i rapporti con il papa, tuttavia, dopo che il giovane Welf divorziò da Matilde nel 1095, Welf fece ammenda con il re Enrico IV e fu riconfermato nella sua posizione di duca di Baviera. Dopo la morte di suo padre Azzo nel 1097, Welf cercò di acquisire la proprietà dei suoi padri a sud delle Alpi, nel 1099, Welf si unì a quella che sarebbe diventata nota come la Crociata del 1101, insieme a Guglielmo IX d'Aquitania, Ugo di Vermandois e Ida d'Austria. Il suo principale successo fu quello di evitare uno scontro tra compagni crociati, che avevano saccheggiato il territorio bizantino sulla loro strada per Costantinopoli, lo stesso Welfo sfuggito al fiasco, ma morì sulla sua strada di ritorno a Paphos, Cipro, nel 1101 e fu sepolto nell'abbazia di Weingarten.

Successe al fratello maggiore Welf II come duca bavarese, quando quest'ultimo morì senza figli nel 1120, Enrico fu anche determinante nel portare a termine il Concordato di Worms del 1122, ponendo fine alla lunga controversia sull'investitura tra papa e imperatore. Il matrimonio si concluse nel maggio 1127, l'estraniamento tra le dinastie Welf e Hohenstaufen durò fino al XIII secolo.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Seguici su Facebook<br/><br/>SEI UN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Voglia di zucchero? Ecco cosa il tuo corpo sta cercando di dirti<br/><br/>di<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Aumento di peso da voglie fuori controllo a parte, può essere frustrante avere un desiderio costante per qualcosa di malsano e non sapere perché. La buona notizia è che di solito c'è una ragione alla base di quel desiderio bruciante di ospitare un sacchetto di patatine fritte, o la sensazione che potresti effettivamente morire se non ottieni un sottaceto in questo istante (anche se non sei incinta). Se hai visioni di barrette della Via Lattea, ad esempio, potrebbe significare che stai perdendo un nutriente molto specifico nella tua dieta. (Sì, è più complicato di quanto detto barretta di cioccolato sia così delizioso.)<br/><br/>Abbiamo parlato con la dietista di Los Angeles Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., per ottenere il magro su alcune voglie comuni di cibo, così come ciò che si può fare per saziare la fame senza andare in mare. Continua a scorrere per alcune informazioni seriamente buone!<br/><br/>Se hai voglia di cioccolato<br/><br/>Significa: potresti essere carente di magnesio nella tua dieta, dice Lenchewski. "Il magnesio è un minerale essenziale coinvolto nella produzione di energia, nel metabolismo del glucosio e nella funzione muscolare. Questo è particolarmente vero per coloro che colpiscono duramente la palestra", spiega. Inoltre, i livelli di magnesio scendono durante le settimane pre-mestruali del tuo periodo, il che spiega perché la sindrome premestruale viene così spesso con voglie di cioccolato.<br/><br/>"Consiglio di attenersi al 75% di cacao o superiore e di abbinarlo con un'altra fonte ricca di magnesio, come i semi di girasole", dice Lenchewski. Suggerisce il marchio di cioccolato Hu, un'azienda di piccoli lotti di alimenti che si concentra su ingredienti di alta qualità prodotti localmente. "È un po 'costoso, ma ancora di più motivo per tenere sotto controllo le porzioni", dice. "È il mio preferito personale." Siamo anche grandi fan di Zenbunni super-alimentare.<br/><br/>Se hai voglia di caramelle<br/><br/>Significa: "Il desiderio di zucchero puro è una buona indicazione che si sta esaurendo l'energia", dice Lenchewski. "Pensateci. Qual è l'unica cosa che ti prude dopo una terribile notte di sonno o intorno alle 4 p.m. durante una giornata di lavoro stressante? La risposta è di solito lo zucchero perché viene utilizzato come combustibile istantaneo per le cellule del nostro corpo.<br/><br/>"Se stai facendo irruzione nella scorta di caramelle dei tuoi colleghi, ti consiglio un carboidrato a combustione più lenta con una fonte di grassi o proteine", dice Lenchewski. A differenza del semplice zucchero, questo alimenterà le cellule evitando allo stesso tempo il crash post-zucchero. Due opzioni che fanno grandi pick-me-ups la prossima volta che si ha voglia di caramelle: una mela affettata con la vostra scelta di burro di noci, o bacche con 2% yogurt greco non zuccherato. Ci piace spezzare un dente dolce con queste patatine di cocco che creano dipendenza, sono ripiene, prive di zuccheri aggiunti e altrettanto buone.<br/><br/>Se hai voglia di sale<br/><br/>Significa: "Se basta solo il sottaceto più salato, potresti non bere abbastanza H2O", dice Lenchewski. "Il sale aiuta il corpo a trattenere l'acqua, quindi lo desideriamo quando abbiamo bisogno di liquidi."<br/><br/>"Rimani idratato, specialmente quando ci avviciniamo ai mesi estivi", dice. La prossima volta che colpisce un desiderio, prova a spegnerlo (letteralmente) con alcuni bicchieri rinfrescanti e potresti scoprire che l'urgenza di binge sodio scompare. "Se l'acqua normale ti annoia, prova ad aggiungere menta, limone o frutta surgelata per mescolarla", dice Lenchewski. E se questo non funziona ancora, c'è un'alternativa più sana alle patatine insaccate o alle patatine fritte. "Se stai davvero solo desiderando il sale dopo tutto, le alghe tostate sono un'ottima opzione a basso contenuto calorico", dice.<br/><br/>Se hai voglia di carboidrati amidacei come la pasta<br/><br/>Significa: "Poiché gli alimenti ad alto contenuto di carboidrati aumentano la serotonina, l'appetito per l'amido può essere un segno che hai bisogno di un booster dell'umore", dice Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Invece, cerca di fare un bagno! "Bust out the Epsom sales, perché è il momento per un serio R + R," dice Lenchewski. "Fidati di me. Indulgere in un amido libero per tutti si sente davvero bene in questo momento, ma è probabile che ti sballare di più il giorno successivo." (Come sa chiunque abbia mai sopportato una pizza o un desiderio di pasta.) Quindi la prossima volta che vuoi tuffare la testa prima in una ciotola di carboidrati, fare un bagno, accendere una candela e trattarti senza rimpianti o calorie dense.<br/><br/>Se hai voglia di gelato<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Significa: "Il tuo corpo potrebbe dirti che ha bisogno di un po 'di grasso sano".<br/><br/>"Sono un realista, quindi se hai voglia di gelato, non ti consiglierò una manciata di noci, che sono, naturalmente, piene di grassi sani", dice Lenchewski. "Per le emergenze di gelato, raccomando i gelati di cocco a basso contenuto di zucchero come Coconut Bliss o il gelato a tre ingredienti di Kippy a Los Angeles." Possiamo garantire il fatto che il gelato di cocco ha un sapore incredibile e proprio come la cosa vera.<br/><br/>Se hai voglia di un hamburger<br/><br/>Significa: Hai bisogno di ferro. "Se non riesci a smettere di pensare alla carne rossa, c'è una possibilità che il tuo corpo abbia bisogno di ferro, b12 e acido folico", dice Lenchewski. "Questo è particolarmente vero durante o intorno a quel periodo del mese."<br/><br/>Invece, cerca un hamburger più sano. "Sono un sostenitore della carne rossa alimentata con erba, antibiotici e senza ormoni una volta alla settimana", dice Lenchewski. "Prova a sperimentare con un hamburger di bisonti a faccia aperta - che, tagliato per tagliare, è più magro e ha più ferro della carne bovina." Non mangiare carne? Prova a incorporare qualche tipo di integratore di ferro a base vegetale nella tua routine, come la spirulina. |

The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website.

Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience.

Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Servizi Web, Venditori e Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Aggiornato il:Aprile 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>L'informatizzazione di questo mondo ha cambiato lo scenario delle prestazioni umane in gran parte e anche oltre la misurazione. Ad esempio, ora è possibile inviare informazioni vitali in tutto il mondo con un solo clic del mouse, grazie alla connettività Internet. Purtroppo, è questa ampia connettività e popolarità tra le persone, Internet ha anche aumentato le possibilità di crimini informatici. I crimini informatici su Internet o crimini informatici sono ampiamente noti come 'Cyber Crimini'.<br/><br/>'Leggi cyber' è qualcosa di nuovo nel sistema giudiziario, ma ha guadagnato molta attenzione ultimamente. Il termine cyber criminalità è qualcosa di molto sinonimo di criminalità convenzionale, l'unica differenza è mezzo di esecuzione. Ci sono principalmente due tipi di crimini informatici, il primo è in cui i computer sono i principali bersagli e questi includono casi di danni ai dati, codice dannoso e persino l'accesso ai dati criminali. Il secondo è in cui il computer è solo uno strumento che utilizza i crimini convenzionali sono commessi per ad esempio il terrorismo informatico, spamming, cyber stalking e molti altri.<br/><br/>Questo è dove un consulente del sito web o un fornitore entra in scena. Anche se non è a conoscenza di tutte le leggi cyber presenti fino ad oggi, un fornitore del sito web può consigliarti su alcune delle leggi cyber più importanti durante la creazione del tuo sito.<br/><br/>Questo può includere la conoscenza comune dei diritti di copia o anche la protezione del contenuto del tuo sito web. Spiegare tutti i diritti che possiedi come proprietario del sito web è anche uno dei compiti che un fornitore di siti web può fare durante lo sviluppo del tuo sito web. Un fornitore può anche aiutarti offrendoti informazioni su diverse leggi informatiche per proteggere i dati. Oltre a tutto questo, un fornitore può anche offrirti informazioni su qualsiasi nuova legge informatica di cui potresti non essere a conoscenza fino a quando non lo sai. Le leggi sul cyber possono variare da nazione a nazione, un esempio recente può essere la legge sui cookie rilasciata nel Regno Unito, che impedisce al sito web di salvare i dati di navigazione degli utenti. Secondo la legge sui cookie, i siti web nel Regno Unito non possono salvare i file cookie senza il consenso informativo del navigatore.<br/><br/>È dopo l'attuazione di tale legge che i siti web hanno ora una finestra pop-up, che richiede il consenso del visitatore per il salvataggio dei file cookie. Tali file vengono utilizzati dai siti web per analizzare il modello di navigazione dei visitatori in base a quali annunci vengono poi pubblicati su una finestra dell'utente. Con l'hacking non più una cosa nuova per tutti noi, pensi che tali regole e regolamenti possano prevenire la falsificazione online o il crimine informatico? La tecnologia si è sviluppata a un ritmo rapido, ma ancora le persone non preferiscono fare acquisti online a causa della paura di dati personali o bancari che vengono hackerati. Con l'aumento della criminalità informatica, la necessità di leggi cibernetiche rigorose è aumentata anche per frenare lo stesso e promuovere un'esperienza di shopping priva di rischi.<br/><br/>Classi di reati informatici<br/><br/>Nel corso degli anni ci sono state tre principali classi di crimini informatici:<br/><br/>Accesso non autorizzato di casi di sistema informatico, che comporta l'hacking o il furto di nomi utente e password per ottenere l'accesso attraverso le informazioni personali del rispettivo utente. Questo tipo di accesso backdoor è organizzato con l'aiuto di Cavallo di Troia. Rilascio di programmi dannosi come Trojan House, worm o virus informatici, ecc. L'ultima classe include il cyber stalking di un utente o le molestie online.<br/><br/>Implicazioni dirette dei crimini informatici<br/><br/>Diminuzione delle vendite<br/><br/>Riduzione dell'output del personale a causa dei ritardi della rete<br/><br/>Perdita di informazioni personalizzate come il lavoro di ricerca<br/><br/>Interruzione del processo di comunicazione<br/><br/>Implicazioni indirette dei crimini informatici<br/><br/>Problema di credibilità nel nostro sistema finanziario<br/><br/>L'immagine del marchio è offuscata nel mercato<br/><br/>I reati informatici influenzano le relazioni di business-to-business nel mercato<br/><br/>Il senso di fiducia nelle politiche statali e nelle agenzie governative è perso<br/><br/>Prevenire la criminalità informatica<br/><br/>Come internauti ci sono alcune precauzioni che dovremmo prendere in considerazione per un'esperienza online sicura e protetta. Ecco alcune di esse:<br/><br/>La prima cosa da fare sarà mantenere le informazioni personali per te stesso ed evitare di condividerle online.<br/><br/>Evitare di condividere qualsiasi foto con amici o sconosciuti online chat.<br/><br/>Installare l'ultima versione di antivirus sul tuo sistema può offrirti una buona linea di difesa contro minacce Internet come virus e malware.<br/><br/>Tenere traccia dei tuoi dati preziosi è una buona opzione per evitare problemi come la contaminazione da virus.<br/><br/>Evita di inviare informazioni sulla carta di credito a siti che non sono sicuri e non hanno alcun certificato valido.<br/><br/>Installazione di un programma di sicurezza che ti offre il controllo sui cookie del sito e ti impedisce di essere tracciato dai siti web.<br/><br/>Mettere dispositivi di rilevamento delle intrusioni basati su host sui server ti aiuterà a tenere traccia delle irregolarità nel traffico del tuo sito web.<br/><br/>Si consiglia l'uso del firewall.<br/><br/>Perché gli attacchi informatici sono così popolari?<br/><br/>Più economico dei tradizionali metodi di imbroglio<br/><br/>Tracciare i crimini informatici non è facile<br/><br/>Le posizioni esatte non possono essere tracciate facilmente<br/><br/>Assenza di barriera fisica nel mondo di Internet<br/><br/>I crimini informatici colpiscono un gran numero di persone<br/><br/>Conclusioni<br/><br/>Il fatto che la mente umana abbia un potere insondabile è innegabile, ed è per questo che i crimini su Internet stanno aumentando a un ritmo tremendo. Anche la storia ha assistito ad alcune delle più grandi sicurezze di Internet che sono state compromesse dalle mani degli hacker, che sono facilmente scappati. L'unico modo per frenare tale crimine è quello di rimanere consapevoli delle leggi cibernetiche che abbiamo oggi, che possono essere attraverso Internet o attraverso i fornitori di siti Web / IT. L'Information Technology Act deve essere bilanciato in modo tale che si dimostri troppo severo per le persone coinvolte in crimini informatici e allo stesso tempo non dovrebbe mai ostacolare la crescita dell'industria di Internet.<br/><br/>Autore Bio:– Maneet Puri attualmente dirige una società di web design di qualità con sede a Nuova Delhi, in India.
