| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Ad esempio, l'articolo VI, Clausola 2 della Costituzione americana ha le disposizioni che "tutti i trattati ... saranno la legge suprema del Land." Anche se è evidente che i trattati da soli non hanno lo stesso effetto delle leggi federali. In realtà, diventano operativi solo una volta che queste disposizioni entrano in vigore come legge federale con l'approvazione del Senato e della Presidenza. Anche se questa è la prassi, è un principio generalmente accettato nel diritto internazionale che alcuni trattati hanno un effetto vincolante sui paesi. Il trattato deve soddisfare il requisito di essere un trattato auto-eseguibile per colpire direttamente il paese senza una corrispondente legislatura interna.<br/><br/>Ciò solleva la questione di quale trattato si qualificherà come "auto-esecutivo" e quale no.<br/><br/>Se un trattato è un trattato auto-esecutivo o meno è deciso dai giudici nazionali su base caso per caso (Buergenthal, 1992). Per capire questo, il documento esaminerà innanzitutto i due tipi di teorie seguite dai paesi sulla natura dei trattati applicabili al diritto interno. Queste due teorie sono il monismo e il dualismo. Essenzialmente considerano il quadro del diritto interno e internazionale come una singola gerarchia e due gerarchie separate, rispettivamente (Wildhaber, 1971). I paesi che seguono il monismo ritengono che alcuni trattati siano immediatamente vincolanti e abbiano effetto immediato sul paese. Una volta che il trattato è stato ratificato, può essere invocato nei tribunali nazionali ed è considerato parte della legge del paese. I paesi che seguono il dualismo ritengono che un trattato non influenzi il diritto interno fino a quando non è stato rafforzato da una legislatura approvata in parlamento. Un esempio di dualismo è il modo in cui la Convenzione europea dei diritti dell’uomo è diventata operativa nel Regno Unito dopo aver approvato la legge sui diritti dell’uomo del 1998 nel loro parlamento (leggi, 2000).<br/><br/>Il diritto internazionale è diverso, così come i tipi di procedure seguite dai diversi paesi per l'accettazione dei trattati. Alcune costituzioni stesse menzionano le procedure per la ratifica di un trattato. Alcuni paesi hanno persino un trattamento diverso per il diritto internazionale dei trattati e il diritto internazionale consuetudinario. Alcune organizzazioni internazionali come l'Unione europea spesso influenzano il diritto interno dei suoi Stati membri. Gli Stati membri dell'Unione europea devono dare attuazione a determinate forme di legislatura comunitaria, anche se essa presenta una differenza essenziale rispetto ai trattati autoesecutivi. La differenza sta nel fatto che non spetta ai giudici nazionali decidere se le disposizioni sono autoesecutive o meno, ma piuttosto alla Corte di giustizia europea di interpretare in base ai suoi trattati costitutivi. Altre forme di diritto internazionale formate attraverso risoluzioni o simili potrebbero non avere lo stesso effetto per questi Stati, ma potrebbero considerarle come forme di "soft law" e esaminarle per interpretare l'intento della legge. A volte, i proclami fatti dagli organi giudiziari di organizzazioni internazionali come la Corte Interamericana dei Diritti Umani influenzano i loro Stati membri. Sebbene tali dichiarazioni non siano vincolanti per gli Stati membri, i giudici nazionali sembrano farvi riferimento per interpretazione autorevole.<br/><br/>Pertanto, è necessario adottare un approccio caso per caso, analizzando le procedure e i precedenti stabiliti in diversi paesi. Per esaminare il concetto di trattati auto-eseguibili, questo documento raffronterà i precedenti stabiliti da diverse giurisdizioni. Se il lettore desidera condurre un'analisi simile, può farlo esaminando i diversi annuari nazionali sul diritto internazionale. Questi annuari avranno principalmente una sezione dedicata al rapporto tra diritto internazionale e diritto nazionale.<br/><br/>Giurisprudenza internazionale:<br/><br/>La questione più importante che si pone per i tribunali nazionali è se il trattato è auto-eseguibile? Se il trattato può essere applicato senza che alcun legislatore interno aggiuntivo abbia approvato per rafforzarlo. Tale questione è stata sollevata nel caso Czesław S c. Tesoro dello Stato e Ministro del Tesoro dello Stato, in cui la Corte costituzionale polacca ha ritenuto che, poiché le disposizioni del trattato si riferivano a misure interne da adottare, il trattato non era di natura auto-esecutiva (Bug rivendicazioni fiume, Czesław S c. Tesoro dello Stato e Ministro del Tesoro dello Stato, 2003). Essenzialmente, quando il trattato fa riferimento alle misure interne da adottare, non crea di per sé nuovi obblighi, ma rafforza invece l'intenzione del trattato che il processo giuridico interno adotti misure per lo stesso. Una questione simile è stata sollevata nel caso Sosa negli Stati Uniti d'America. In questo caso, il tribunale ha esaminato se il Patto internazionale sui diritti civili e politici fosse un trattato auto-esecutivo. La Corte Suprema americana ha anche dichiarato che il Patto internazionale sui diritti civili e politici non è un trattato auto-esecutivo (Corte, 2004). La Corte suprema federale svizzera ha esaminato anche la natura autoesecutiva del Patto internazionale sui diritti civili e politici. La questione dinanzi al tribunale era se l'articolo 13, paragrafo 2, lettere b) e c) fosse di natura autoesecutiva. Il tribunale ha esaminato se il trattato fosse parzialmente auto-eseguibile e lo ha fatto controllando se esistesse un contenuto di base minimo per il trattato per essere applicabile. Il tribunale ha ritenuto di non aver trovato una siffatta disposizione nel trattato (A e B c Governo del Cantone di Zurigo, 2000).<br/><br/>È essenziale capire che queste questioni differiscono dalla questione fondamentale se il diritto internazionale possa essere applicato come parte del diritto del paese. Per rispondere a questa domanda, il documento esaminerà la sentenza della Corte Suprema della Repubblica Dominicana. La Corte Suprema ha dichiarato che l'articolo 3 della Costituzione della Repubblica Dominicana ha reso il diritto internazionale vincolante per l'ordinamento giuridico interno. La Corte ha respinto l'interpretazione del Tribunale Superiore del Territorio secondo cui questi trattati erano "legislatura straniera" e non facevano parte dell'ordine giuridico interno. La Corte Suprema ha stabilito che tutti i trattati ratificati dalla Repubblica Dominicana facevano parte della legge dominicana e, quindi, possono essere definiti auto-esecuzione (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción e ors, 1997). La Corte suprema federale svizzera ha esaminato se il Trattato di Libson fosse autonomo e direttamente applicabile alle università svizzere. Secondo la giurisprudenza pertinente, una norma del trattato è direttamente applicabile se il suo contenuto è sufficientemente preciso e chiaro da costituire la base di una decisione in un caso particolare. La norma deve quindi essere giustiziabile, vale a dire definire i diritti e gli obblighi di un individuo ed essere indirizzata alle autorità competenti" (X v Università di Lucerna, 2014). Ciò implica che il fatto che il trattato sia direttamente applicabile o meno dipende dal fatto che la norma sia giustiziabile. Il trattato di Lisbona si basa sul principio delle qualifiche acquisite a bordo, come trasmesso dall'articolo IV, paragrafo 1, del trattato. Lo scopo era quello di creare un obbligo per gli Stati di dimostrare che il loro processo decisionale è equo, trasparente e non discriminatorio. La responsabilità di dimostrare che il richiedente non ha soddisfatto i criteri richiesti spetta all'organismo che effettua la valutazione. Il trattato garantisce garanzie procedurali, che sono generalmente accettate dai paesi e quindi il tribunale ha ritenuto che questo trattato fosse auto-esecutivo. Questo continua a mostrare le diverse interpretazioni adottate dai tribunali di diversi paesi.<br/><br/>È essenziale osservare se le norme stabilite dai trattati sono effettivamente rispettate. Le leggi giurisdizionali di varie giurisdizioni hanno sottolineato che i tribunali nazionali sono l'autorità finale sulla questione se un trattato sia auto-esecutivo. C'è anche un dovere intrinseco imposto ai paesi per l'osservanza e la dovuta esecuzione dei trattati, come stabilito dalla regola Pacta Sunt Servanda, come sancito dall'articolo 26 della Convenzione di Vienna sul diritto dei trattati (VCLT). L'articolo 27 continua a rafforzarlo affermando che gli obblighi di diritto internazionale non possono essere ignorati utilizzando il diritto interno come giustificazione; molti tribunali di paesi hanno utilizzato questo come fonte di interpretazione, come la Corte costituzionale lettone. Nel caso di una norma nazionale in conflitto con una norma internazionale, il tribunale ha ritenuto che la norma nazionale fosse nulla. Per giungere alla sua conclusione, il tribunale si è fortemente affidato alla necessaria esecuzione dei trattati in buona fede come previsto dall’articolo 26 della VCLT (Linija c. Lettonia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusione:<br/><br/>Da quanto precede risulta chiaramente che i trattati presentano requisiti particolari prima di poter essere considerati autoesecutivi; tuttavia, lasciando da parte tutti questi elementi, l'interpretazione più importante resta quella dei tribunali nazionali. I tribunali nazionali decidono se il trattato può essere definito auto-esecuzione o meno. Anche se la loro Costituzione potrebbe contenere una disposizione secondo cui il diritto dei trattati è la legge suprema del paese, i tribunali di diversi paesi interpretano queste disposizioni in modi diversi. Questo può essere visto come le costituzioni americane e dominicane contengono entrambe queste disposizioni, ma seguono interpretazioni completamente diverse dello stesso. Il termine "auto-esecuzione" potrebbe non essere congruo per questi trattati in quanto, in pratica, essi necessitano ancora dell'approvazione dei tribunali nazionali. Idealmente, la via da seguire dovrebbe essere che i paesi riconoscono la natura auto-esecutiva dei trattati e li trattano in un modo in cui gli articoli 26 e 27 della VCLT sono rispettati. Ancora una volta, questa è la situazione "ideale" e non è probabile che trovi la sua strada nella pratica statale di alcune giurisdizioni in qualsiasi momento presto. Tuttavia, la speranza può essere guadagnata esaminando le interpretazioni dei tribunali nazionali che rispettano queste norme e sperando di aprire la strada ad altri tribunali per riconoscerlo.<br/><br/>Riferimenti:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Dai un'occhiata alla nostra raccolta di blog scritti da colleghi del personale.<br/><br/>BLOG INFORMATIVO<br/><br/>Non stressarlo<br/><br/>di<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; 12 nov. 2020<br/><br/>Lo stress, non importa quanto grandi cose stiano andando, può sempre trovare un modo per sollevare la sua brutta testa. Sia che si tratti di una richiesta di lavoro dell'ultimo minuto o di un documento che hai dimenticato di scrivere ed è dovuto il giorno successivo, lo stress può sempre trovare un modo per entrare nella tua giornata se lo permetti. Oggi vi mostrerò alcune cose che potete fare per eliminare o prevenire lo stress.<br/><br/>La prima cosa che puoi fare è esercitare. L'esercizio fisico è un ottimo modo per alleviare lo stress perché abbassa l'ormone dello stress nel tuo corpo noto come cortisolo. Più bassi sono i livelli di cortisolo nel tuo corpo, più basso sarà il tuo livello di stress. L'esercizio fisico può anche aumentare la vostra fiducia, e quando la vostra fiducia è in alto, allora il vostro stress è di solito giù. Per me, quando mi stresso, mi alleno sempre andando in palestra e praticando boxe, mi aiuta a bruciare calorie e ridurre lo stress mentre mi diverto.<br/><br/>Scrivere le cose è stato un modo per calmare le persone per molto tempo, ed è il prossimo argomento sulla nostra lista. Scrivere ciò che ti sta facendo stressare è un modo per chiarire la mente e aiuta anche a sbarazzarsi dello stress. Ho un'esperienza simile quando scrivo storie, di solito se non riesco a pensare a una nuova idea a causa di una vecchia, scriverò la vecchia idea e ci penserò. Questo è quando nuove idee iniziano a sorgere e posso continuare a scrivere normalmente. Lo stesso vale per lo stress. Pensate a un ruscello che continua a scorrere lungo il suo percorso fino a quando non colpisce una diga di castoro, e quella diga blocca il flusso d'acqua e tutto inizia ad accumularsi. L'unico modo per riportare il flusso d'acqua alla normalità è rimuovere la diga. Qui è dove entra in gioco la scrittura. Quando la scrivi, stai rimuovendo lo stress pezzo per pezzo fino a quando non riesci a pensare normalmente di nuovo.<br/><br/>Lo stress può entrare nella nostra vita attraverso le porte della nostra vita che teniamo aperte. La procrastinazione è un modo in cui possiamo lasciare le porte aperte per lo stress. Aspettare fino a domani può essere divertente per oggi, ma ti farà male domani, ed è una soluzione molto miope. Più a lungo aspetti di fare qualcosa, più grande diventa qualcosa e più grande diventa lo stress che stai invitando nella tua vita. Prendersi cura di qualcosa non appena lo riceviamo è un ottimo modo per prevenire lo stress, ma è qualcosa che richiede grande disciplina da fare. Più elimini la procrastinazione dalla tua vita, più sarai privo di stress. Quindi chiudi quella porta, stai lasciando uscire tutta l'aria fredda.<br/><br/>Quindi esaminiamo: Esercizio, Scrivi ciò che ti stressa e Non procrastinare. Questi sono solo alcuni modi per alleviare lo stress, ma per me, sono i più efficaci. Anche se so che questi potrebbero non funzionare per tutti, vorrei invitare chiunque si senta stressato a ricercare come sbarazzarsene. |
