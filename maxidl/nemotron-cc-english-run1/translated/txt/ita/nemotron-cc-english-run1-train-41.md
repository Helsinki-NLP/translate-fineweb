| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 nov 2015<br/>Pubblicato da Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa è una pianta perenne che prospera nelle regioni paludose subtropicali e tropicali di tutto il mondo. L'erba altamente considerata è un ingrediente chiave di Doxiderol, un integratore nutrizionale che migliora la funzione cognitiva. Bacopa è stato scelto per la sua capacità di proteggere il cervello e aumentare l'acetilcolina, un messaggero biochimico che consente al sistema nervoso di trasmettere informazioni.<br/><br/>I praticanti ayurvedici descrissero per la prima volta le proprietà terapeutiche della bacopa nel 300 a.C. I medici registrarono le capacità della bacopa di migliorare l'intelligenza e la memoria. Quasi 2.500 anni dopo, un corpo crescente di ricerche moderne conferma i benefici cognitivi della bacopa registrati nel testo ayurvedico.<br/><br/>Nel 1987, i ricercatori in India hanno valutato gli effetti della bacopa sulla funzione intellettuale dei bambini in età scolare. Durante lo studio di quattro settimane, hanno somministrato bacopa a 40 bambini di età compresa tra 6 e 8 anni. Gli scienziati hanno determinato che la bacopa ha aumentato la percezione e la memoria. I bambini sono stati in grado di risolvere gli esercizi del labirinto più velocemente e con maggiore precisione dopo aver ricevuto la bacopa. Molti genitori in India usano abitualmente la bacopa per migliorare lo sviluppo intellettuale dei loro figli.<br/><br/>Uno studio di 12 settimane pubblicato nel numero di agosto 2001 di Psychopharmacology ha studiato gli effetti della bacopa sulla funzione cognitiva. Gli scienziati hanno assegnato in modo casuale i volontari sani, di età compresa tra 18 e 65 anni, a ricevere bacopa o una sostanza inattiva. Hanno anche utilizzato una configurazione in doppio cieco per lo studio per nascondere le identità dei prodotti. I ricercatori utilizzano questo design per garantire che i risultati dei test siano validi perché elimina i pregiudizi da parte dei ricercatori e dei partecipanti. Il gruppo bacopa ha sperimentato un miglioramento significativo nella velocità con cui sono stati in grado di elaborare le informazioni visive. I partecipanti hanno anche imparato più velocemente e memorizzato nuovi ricordi in modo più efficiente.<br/><br/>Nel 2007, uno studio di laboratorio del Texas A & M College of Medicine ha rivelato uno dei meccanismi responsabili della capacità della bacopa di promuovere la salute del cervello. Secondo gli scienziati, la bacopa utilizza i polifenoli per prevenire lo stress ossidativo e il danno che causa alle cellule cerebrali sane. Bacopa riduce anche i depositi nocivi di una sostanza nota come beta-amiloide, che è il componente primario della placca nel cervello dei pazienti con malattia di Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Uno studio in doppio cieco pubblicato nel numero di luglio 2008 del Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine ha valutato l'effetto della bacopa sui pazienti anziani. Lo studio ha confermato che la bacopa ha aumentato le prestazioni cognitive riducendo allo stesso tempo lo stress. Secondo gli autori, i benefici ottenuti in questo studio hanno confermato i risultati di ricerche precedenti.<br/><br/>Uno studio di 90 giorni pubblicato nel numero di dicembre 2008 di Phytotherapy Research conferma i benefici cognitivi che sono stati precedentemente dimostrati in altri studi di bacopa. Bacopa ha migliorato significativamente la capacità dei partecipanti di memorizzare e utilizzare temporaneamente le informazioni necessarie per completare un compito complesso. Lo studio in doppio cieco ha anche dimostrato che bacopa ha ridotto il tempo necessario per elaborare le informazioni visive.<br/><br/>Oltre a migliorare la trasmissione del segnale nervoso, gli scienziati teorizzano che la bacopa aumenta la funzione cognitiva riducendo l'ansia. Numerosi studi indicano che l'ansia interferisce con la capacità di svolgere compiti che richiedono funzioni cognitive di livello superiore, come l'apprendimento e la memorizzazione. Lo stress interrompe i messaggeri biochimici e la trasmissione del segnale nervoso sano. Bacopa allevia lo stress e ripristina un senso di calma aumentando i livelli di acetilcolina, che riduce la frequenza cardiaca e consente di fare respiri più profondi.<br/><br/>Il doxiderol è un ottimo modo per ottenere i benefici della bacopa. Questo integratore olistico contiene anche altri ingredienti naturali che promuovono la salute del cervello e supportano la capacità di concentrarsi e concentrarsi su compiti complessi e memorizzare informazioni. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

Può anche percepire aure demoniache e aure malvagie. Quando è nata e cresciuta, tuttavia, i suoi poteri sono stati sigillati e lei era molto meno potente. Dalla sconfitta di colui che ha sigillato i suoi poteri, Kagome ha raggiunto il suo pieno potenziale.<br/><br/>PURIFICAZIONE Facendo una connessione fisica, Kagome ha la capacità di purificare sia il veleno che l'oscurità da un soggetto (vivo e inanimato). Per fare questo, proietta i suoi poteri spirituali attraverso la sua mano.<br/><br/>Con il suo pieno potenziale, Kagome ha la capacità di creare una barriera intorno a se stessa ed espanderla intorno agli altri. È una barriera a forma di cupola che può distruggere i demoni deboli che entrano in contatto con la barriera.<br/><br/>OCCHIO MIGLIORATO<br/>Kagome ha la capacità di vedere cose che sono spesso invisibili all'occhio umano: fantasmi, spiriti, aure divine e malvagie.<br/><br/>Abilità con armi<br/>Kagome ha la capacità di usare un arco e una freccia. È stata addestrata da sola, e dopo anni di pratica, la sua freccia raramente perde il suo segno. Insieme a questo, Kagome ha la capacità di infuso le sue frecce con poteri. Può infuso una freccia con i suoi poteri spirituali che consente loro di penetrare forze demoniache, distruggere incantesimi e purificare oggetti. Può infuso il suo arco con i suoi poteri e deviare gli attacchi nemici. Ha la capacità di infuso le sue frecce con energia purificante per purificare il veleno e potenti attacchi demoniaci lontani. E, infine, ha la capacità di aggirare gli altri con la sua freccia: se il suo obiettivo si trova dietro una barriera o un ostaggio, la freccia può teletrasportarsi e colpire solo il suo obiettivo.<br/><br/>Il resto delle sue abilità sono diventate piuttosto insignificanti in quanto sono legate al viaggio nel tempo (attraverso il Pozzo del Mangiatore d'Ossa), il Gioiello di Shikon, o la sua precedente incarnazione.<br/><br/>Il canone<br/><br/>Kagome è stata ritirata pochi giorni dopo il suo diploma di scuola superiore, tuttavia, prima che il pozzo del mangiatore di ossa si sia aperto di nuovo per permetterle di tornare al passato in modo permanente.<br/><br/>Freestyle<br/><br/>Memoria<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Il suono del suo nome era un morbido sussurro in fondo alla sua mente, come una chiamata soffocata dal vento. Era il suono di un lontano ricordo, una voce che aveva cominciato a dimenticare ma che si aggrappava disperatamente allo stesso. Era la voce di sua madre, contorta dal dolore della figlia perduta. Dopo tutto, Kagome fu bandita senza lasciare traccia. Ricordò vividamente quei momenti, il modo in cui la giornata era iniziata, ciò che aveva fatto a colazione e l'ultima cosa che aveva detto a sua madre. Era ossessionante, quei ricordi, perché era come ogni altra volta che era scivolata tra i mondi. Si era svegliata, avida, perché non aveva uno scopo al di fuori della scuola. Poteva trovare un lavoro, ed era in programma per un colloquio quel giorno. Il suo cuore non c'era, ma era quello che doveva fare.<br/><br/>Ricordò la sensazione di terrore, succhiandola e facendosi un discorso di incoraggiamento che poteva fare questo. Che poteva progredire nella vita che era destinata a ora che le cose erano state risolte in passato. Naturalmente, aveva la perenne sensazione di non appartenere più al suo tempo o alla sua vita, non con tutto ciò che aveva lasciato dietro di sé.<br/><br/>Kagome ricordò la sensazione del legno sotto le sue dita, il modo in cui la sua mano si era arricciata nella maniglia per aprire la porta. Ricordò che si era fermata, rivolgendosi a sua madre con un sorriso luminoso e vibrante mentre si scuoteva dal suo stupore. "Sto decollando." Ricordò quanto forte suonava la sua voce, il sorriso sulle labbra di sua madre mentre i suoi occhi brillavano di orgoglio. Sua madre le disse addio, il che non sembrava diverso da prima, ma in qualche modo il peso delle parole era più pesante sulle spalle di Kagome più rifletteva.<br/><br/>In breve, i pensieri lampeggiarono in avanti, chiedendosi se sua madre fosse preoccupata per lei, se la mancasse come lei. Kagome poteva apertamente ammettere che la forza di sua madre, il suo sostegno per il fatto che sua figlia scivolava nel tempo così spesso. Ci sono stati momenti in cui si riteneva debole per non avere la donna su cui appoggiarsi.<br/><br/>Tuttavia, si ricordò di aver raccolto una magra quantità di forza. Poteva ricordare il cambiamento nell'aria, la temperatura notevolmente diversa da quello che si aspettava, lampeggiando all'improvviso e sconosciuto ambiente circostante. Non era il santuario della sua famiglia. E quando si voltò per tornare indietro, per scivolare attraverso la porta che aveva attraversato, si trovò con metallo sconosciuto e freddo sotto la punta delle dita e un interno che non era l'ingresso della sua casa. Un uomo stava davanti a lei, dietro un bancone, che la fissava con occhi larghi come i suoi.<br/><br/>Almeno non si e' fatta prendere dal panico, essendo stata lacerata nel tempo e messa in situazioni impossibili, almeno ha costruito la tua forza di volontà per quanto riguarda gli strani avvenimenti. Perché non era ogni giorno che qualcuno si trovava trascinato nel passato da un demone, con l'intenzione di strappare un potente gioiello dal loro corpo che non sapevano nemmeno che c'era. E poi c'era il fatto che lei aveva fatto a pezzi quel potente gioiello in chissà quanti pezzi e aveva il compito di trovarli. Tali cose non erano normali, e aveva dovuto mettersi in piedi e rotolare con esso una volta che si rese conto che era la sua realtà. Era sembrato così semplice, basta raccogliere i frammenti e riparare il gioiello.<br/><br/>Ma non era stato facile, c'erano molti demoni dopo i frammenti e il gioiello stesso. E un demone particolarmente potente con un desiderio che era determinato a vedere realizzato. Fino ad oggi, non aveva mai appreso il suo desiderio, ma sapeva che non era mai stato concesso nemmeno una volta che aveva completato la cosa esplosa. Aveva rovinato così tante vite per nulla. Rovinato così tante vite per un compito così futile. Naraku era stato il nemico più difficile, e quello che era stato il centro di tutto ciò che era andato storto in tutte le vite della sua amica.<br/><br/>Ma, era quella imprevedibilità, quella necessità di rotolare con ciò che stava accadendo e la forza di volontà che aveva guadagnato dalla sua avventura che ricordava di disegnare su per venire con una storia che si adattava al momento che non sembrava troppo capriccioso o troppo ricercato. Aveva bisogno di essere creduto, aveva bisogno di sopravvivere.<br/><br/>Dopo tutto, ha affrontato peggio di un uomo in un negozio di macchine fotografiche. Aveva mentito tra i denti per salvarsi la vita prima.<br/><br/>"Stavo cercando un lavoro." Alla fine, non era una bugia completa. Dopo tutto, lei era uscita di casa con l'intenzione di partecipare a un colloquio di lavoro. Il suo stato di vestito lo avrebbe almeno attestato. Era uno dei fibs più facili che avesse mai detto.<br/><br/>E, per qualche ragione, quel pazzo l'ha assunta.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed si arrotolò nel suo letto mentre respingeva i ricordi lontani, rifiutando di riconoscere che era davvero sveglia. Si afferrò agli ultimi scorci di sonno, implorandola di tornare e di riportarla nel suo abbraccio. Chiuse gli occhi, volenterosa di venire a dormire, e si ritrovò solo con i ricordi. Gli echi di una canzone cantavano in lontananza dei suoi ricordi, una canzone che spesso l’aveva tormentata, dato lo stesso nome di lei. La voce che cantava non ricordava più sua madre, ma le voci dei bambini con cui aveva spesso giocato da grande. Hanno richiamato i ricordi, anche se erano passati anni da quando ha iniziato questo live, anche se era felice in questa vita, il richiamo di questi ricordi era troppo forte.<br/><br/>Improvvisamente, lei stava cadendo di nuovo in loro e il sonno le evadeva di nuovo. Lei stava guardando se stessa nell'abbraccio della sua famiglia mentre Inuyasha era stata tirata indietro nel pozzo, guardando come spaventata come si era sentita. I ricordi di quel momento, quei sentimenti, erano ancora così forti. La sensazione di dolore e di dolore si ripresentò anche se era passato così tanto tempo da quando aveva sentito di essere stata strappata via da tutto ciò che le importava.<br/><br/>Naturalmente la sua famiglia contava, e lei era felice di essere di nuovo tra le loro braccia. Lei non potrebbe mai pienamente, veramente descrivere come si era sentita in quei giorni. Non riusciva ancora a spiegare il modo in cui si sentiva divisa in due, con desideri conflittuali di essere sia nel suo passato che nel suo presente. Ricordò i futili tentativi di saltare attraverso il pozzo, con le dita afferrate al suolo in una disperata supplica di lasciarla tornare. Il primo mese a casa, non dormiva tanto quanto piangeva.<br/><br/>Elysion aveva guarnito una reazione simile, anche se non era così feroce perché non sapeva esattamente dove era scivolata attraverso né sapeva dove poteva verme la sua strada di ritorno. Le sue esplorazioni erano sottili tra lavorare il suo lavoro e cercare di stabilirsi in questa vita. Non aveva alcuna intenzione di rimanere, nessuna intenzione di indugiare più a lungo del necessario. E anche se non ci ha provato ferocemente come quando ha cercato di tornare al passato, la sua passione era decuplicata perché non aveva legami con questo mondo. Perché era veramente sola... senza speranza che nessuno la raggiungesse.<br/><br/>Nei suoi momenti irrazionali, pensò che il Gioiello l’avesse tirata indietro e avesse trovato un nuovo inferno in cui risiedere. Un nuovo inferno che la avrebbe costretta a fare un desiderio, ma si ricordò molto chiaramente che aveva desiderato che fosse andato per sempre. Questo non ha fermato i suoi sogni, i momenti in cui si svegliava piangendo nella notte, e quei ricordi del suo passato erano i più difficili da affrontare, i più difficili da dimenticare. Il suo cuore cominciò a correre nel panico mentre si girava di nuovo nel suo letto, il suo respiro divenne una lotta mentre combatteva contro un attacco di panico indotto dalla sua mente errante fino a tarda notte.<br/><br/>Odiava sentirsi così debole, così spaventata.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome si alzò finalmente dal letto, la sua stanza fu illuminata da una luce pallida che era sufficiente per guidarla al bagno. Lei stava davanti allo specchio, il lavandino correva mentre fissava il suo riflesso. I capelli colorati di Raven le coprivano il viso e lei si sentiva così male come sembrava. La sua prima mattinata ad Elysion era simile a questa, solo che lei era in peggiore forma.<br/><br/>Aveva trovato un posto dove dormire, riuscendo a trovare un accordo con il proprietario dell'edificio per permetterle di rimanere un breve periodo di tempo senza pagare. Forse era stata l'influenza di Miroku che le permise di fare tali accordi, poiché il monaco era noto per il suo modo di affascinare (o truffare) le persone per dare loro più che sufficiente per il lavoro che avevano fatto. Il monaco era sempre stato così, fin da quando si erano incontrati per la prima volta. Sosteneva che la dimora di un signore fosse infestata quando non lo era o, sosteneva che erano soggetti a un attacco quando non lo sarebbero stati. Vendeva i suoi rioni e i suoi amuleti a prezzi così alti. Funzionava praticamente ogni volta e si chiedeva perché la gente fosse così disposta a fidarsi di lui.<br/><br/>Forse era il suo sorriso, o il fatto che fosse un monaco che le persone del passato erano così disposte a sgretolarsi. Non ha mai predato i deboli, almeno. Ha sempre fatto ciò che era giusto ed è stato un simbolo di forza per lei in momenti in cui ha spinto attraverso tutto al fine di fare ciò che era giusto. Ha spinto attraverso il fatto che stava morendo, che era stato maledetto, e ha cercato di fare qualcosa al riguardo piuttosto che vacillare nel suo destino. Si era spinto al limite nel tempo che conduceva alla loro lotta finale. Ed era stata contenta che avessero sconfitto Naraku prima che potesse essere soggetto alla stessa sorte di suo padre, e suo padre prima di lui.<br/><br/>Per quanto riguarda il suo fascino, tuttavia, era più giusta della sua amica e rendeva l'affare ragionevole. Dubitava che qualcuno in questo mondo avrebbe pagato un prezzo pesante per un esorcismo o per bandire i demoni. Erano troppo tecnologicamente avanzati per questo. Ma era abbastanza intelligente, e abbastanza intelligente, per fare un buon affare.<br/><br/>Ma ora, Kagome era in un posto migliore, anche se l'aspetto sul suo viso sembrava lo stesso. Stregata, stanca, drenata...<br/><br/>Un rapido sguardo a un orologio sul muro le disse che avrebbe potuto cercare di dormire più a lungo. Ma lei scelse di non farlo, non volendo affrontare di nuovo i flashback. Ha preso una doccia invece, usando l'acqua fredda per scacciare i suoi demoni, per riempire i suoi polmoni con un forte apporto di respiro e forzarsi sveglia.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Non ha funzionato.<br/><br/>Non nel modo in cui voleva. L'acqua fredda certamente costrinse l'aria nei suoi polmoni, costrinse la sua mente a svegliarsi e i muscoli a cogliere. Una risata amara le fu tolta dalle labbra mentre inclinava la testa indietro e si ritrovò a ricordare di più. Oggi, non stava per sfuggire loro così facilmente. Non stava per riprendersi così semplicemente, per recuperare solo perché lo voleva.<br/><br/>A volte, non puoi evitare i pensieri che volevi, anche quando eri sicuro di averli superati.<br/><br/>Sango sarebbe stata di grande aiuto in questa situazione. L'assassina del demone era la sua migliore amica, sarebbe persino arrivata a chiamarla la sorella che non aveva mai avuto. Una sorella maggiore che era saggia, aveva sempre la sua parte quando si verificavano problemi. In particolare i problemi dei ragazzi, quando queste cose erano piuttosto banali, ma era divertente avere una cotta e per la sua amica essere arrabbiata per lei quando Inuyasha la rendeva triste. Dopo tutto, era stato spesso che il mezzo demone correva dalla parte del suo amante morto e le spezzava il cuore più di una volta.<br/><br/>Ma Sango la ispirò anche in altri modi: dopo tutto quello che aveva affrontato, era sempre stata così forte, così sicura... Anche nei momenti in cui aveva dubitato di se stessa, riusciva sempre a superare. Ammirava che avesse la capacità di sopravvivere dopo aver perso tutta la sua famiglia - il promemoria di questo spesso spinse Kagome a sopravvivere, perché perse tutti a questo mondo - e poi avere suo fratello diventato una pedina di Naraku. Non era facile, non poteva essere qualcosa che chiunque potesse affrontare e andare avanti. Sorrideva ancora, anche con quel dolore e quei promemoria... Era spesso così brillante, anche nei tempi più bui.<br/><br/>E in questo momento, voleva appoggiarsi al fianco della donna più anziana, per confortarsi nel fatto che lei era lì e lei era di supporto. Sentiva che Sango avrebbe in qualche modo superare questo, e offrire alcune parole di forza e comprensione. Sono stati momenti come questi che hanno peggiorato questi incantesimi, il costante promemoria che lei era senza la sua famiglia.<br/><br/>"Non voglio essere sola." Gridò ad alta voce nella sua solitudine, il suono della doccia affogando la supplica.<br/><br/>Non aveva paura di ammetterlo.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Un'altra ora era passata prima che se ne rendesse conto. La sua pelle era fredda dall'acqua e sembrava che il ghiaccio le scorresse attraverso le vene. Non si era resa conto che aveva iniziato a tremare fino a quando la sua mano ha raggiunto per spegnere l'acqua e terminare la sua doccia. Kagome non cercò di nuovo il suo sguardo nello specchio, ma si avvolse in asciugamani e usciva dal bagno, salendo le scale e entrando nella sua cucina. Ha iniziato a fare una colazione leggera, leggendo oziosamente i suoi appunti per il giorno mentre il cibo cucinava.<br/><br/>La sua carriera è davvero decollata in questi ultimi anni. Le sue foto sono state presentate in molte gallerie, il suo nome ha iniziato a frequentare molte labbra per coloro che erano interessati alla fotografia.<br/><br/>Il lavoro che aveva chiesto per un capriccio aveva scatenato tutto. Era stata molto più fortunata di quanto si aspettasse di essere in questo mondo. Mai abbastanza fortunata per scivolare indietro attraverso le crepe nel suo mondo, ma abbastanza fortunata da fare bene. Mentre tornava alla stufa, si ricordò del momento in cui aveva finalmente rinunciato a tornare a casa. Erano circa due anni della sua vita qui, poiché aveva iniziato ad avventurarsi nella fotografia come qualcosa di più di un semplice hobby, ma qualcosa con cui poteva farsi un nome.<br/><br/>Quella giornata era stata particolarmente piacevole, il sole era alto nel cielo e lei si era ritrovata a scattare alcune foto del paesaggio naturale. Un ragazzino si era nascosto in una delle piante, e lei aveva scattato una foto del momento in cui il suo viso si era sistemato in un sorriso allegro e malizioso prima che saltasse fuori per spaventare la sua preda. Le ricordava Shippou, il piccolo kitsune che aveva, essenzialmente, adottato. Anche lui era stato strappato dalla sua famiglia quando si erano incontrati per la prima volta. Suo padre lo uccise e lui era determinato a vendicarlo. Fin da giovane, sembrava così maturo nei loro primi incontri.<br/><br/>Forse era stata l'influenza di Inuyasha che ha permesso al kit di agire di nuovo come un bambino, di essere giovane e capriccioso a volte mentre altri lui era più maturo. Egli le offriva conforto a modo suo, e lei cercava di prendersi cura di lui come avrebbe fatto lei, anche se all’epoca era stata così giovane. Tuttavia, la sua giovinezza non le impediva di capire come prendersi cura di lui o prendersi cura di lui come suo figlio. Il suo cuore si gonfiò quando sorrise, quando era stato così felice per il suo dono di matite e si prese il tempo di fare arte. Era così orgogliosa di ogni disegno che aveva finito che sapeva che così si sentiva una madre in una situazione simile.<br/><br/>Il dolore che le aveva strappato era troppo, troppo improvviso. Le mancava e voleva vedere quanto era cresciuto da quando se n'era andata. Le era mancato così tanto...<br/><br/>Per risparmiarsi ulteriori sofferenze, false speranze... si arrese... e si concentrò sul miglioramento di se stessa.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>La colazione aveva un sapore sgradevole, noioso e ispirato. Solo dopo aver finito si rese conto di aver dimenticato qualsiasi tipo di spezie o sapore del cibo. Era troppo tardi per ricordarlo, perché la sua mente era troppo occupata a ricordare altri dettagli della sua vita che chiaramente erano diventati più importanti del suo cibo.<br/><br/>"Siediti!"<br/><br/>Naturalmente, non è successo nulla quando ha urlato con rabbia a un cliente particolarmente frustrante che le ricordava il mezzo demone. Era particolarmente testardo e scortese, voleva una foto presa a modo suo piuttosto che lasciarla funzionare naturalmente. Si poteva cercare di costringere gli animali selvatici a comportarsi come si voleva. Ma, raramente, qualcuno ha avuto successo con la forza. Inuyasha non era così male, tuttavia. Inuyasha aveva imparato prima di essere stata costretta via da lui. Era diventato più gentile, più comprensivo, più maturo, anche se a volte era ancora infantile e arrogante.<br/><br/>Ricorda come le sue guance fossero rosse, ma come si fosse alzata e lo avesse licenziato. Gli disse che si rifiutava di lavorare per chiunque o con chiunque volesse torcere qualcosa al di là della sua natura, al di là dei suoi propri desideri.<br/><br/>Avrebbe dovuto paragonare l'uomo a Naraku piuttosto che a Inuyasha. Anche se il suo cliente non aveva intenzioni così estreme. Almeno la sensazione dopo era un ricordo piacevole. La libertà di sapere che era arrivata così lontano da poter rifiutare un lavoro che non voleva fare, di essere la propria persona che era indipendente dagli altri. Anche se ha sentito voci giorni dopo con parole destinate a calunniarla.<br/><br/>Si è difesa con giustizia, come ha fatto verso la fine del suo viaggio. Dopo tutto, era l'unica in grado di proteggersi in questo mondo.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>La luce del mattino ha cominciato a strisciare nella sua casa, ricordandole ancora una volta il passare del tempo. Ancora una volta, ha considerato la lista delle cose che doveva fare e ha discusso su dove iniziare. O, se dovesse anche iniziare a tutti. Con il modo in cui la giornata è iniziata, non sapeva se poteva considerare una grande idea. Era dubbio che avrebbe avuto successo con quanto perso in se stessa stava diventando.<br/><br/>Non voleva rovinare il suo ultimo lavoro. Perché l'aveva fatto in alcune occasioni prima. Non era piacevole cercare di riprendersi da un disastro completo.<br/><br/>Kagome ricordò la sensazione della sua costosa macchina fotografica nuova di zecca che le scivolava dalle mani. Non era pronta a sostenerla, perché l'aveva appena rimossa dalla borsa. Parte di lei urlava all'interno. Un drammatico, over-the-top, pieno di urla che spesso faceva quando era molto, molto più giovane. Quando stava lottando per superare la scuola media mentre saltava tra le volte. L’altra parte di lei era rimasta congelata, mentre la sua lente si era completamente frantumata e il resto della fotocamera si era rotta.<br/><br/>Vedere il fratello di Inuyasha, un demone pieno, in piedi davanti a lei era l'ultima cosa che si aspettava quando si era fatta strada per le sue foto. Era orgoglioso come sempre, alto come sempre, imponente come lei ricordava. Non sembrava affatto sconvolto per essere in un mondo completamente diverso, anche se lei non era mai stata la migliore a leggere la sua mente. Il suo nome sulle sue labbra era così potente, che poteva ricordare i più piccoli sentimenti come faceva lei. Le labbra erano screpolate, la bocca secca e la sensazione di ansia nello stomaco la faceva sentire male.<br/><br/>Non voleva che le sue speranze finissero.<br/><br/>Ma voleva che fosse lì, anche se non erano amici. Erano alleati, se non altro, dal momento che avevano combattuto fianco a fianco. E qualcosa era meglio di assolutamente niente.<br/><br/>E Kagome ebbe il senso di non gettarsi contro di lui, di avvolgergli le braccia con sollievo che sapendo che non era sola, la sua macchina fotografica non contava più quando si avvicinò a lui. Si ricordò che per giorni non importava altro, poiché trascorreva del tempo con lui, non parlando del loro mondo, ma parlando (oppure, lei parlava e lui semplicemente riconosceva questo fatto).<br/><br/>Quando, esattamente, si innamorò di lui però... Kagome non se ne ricordava. Era una cosa sottile, proprio come lui. Ma sapeva che la sensazione era lì. E le fece sapere che non era sola nel fatto che lei era caduta, che i sentimenti erano in qualche modo fioriti.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Una sensazione di assenza di peso la colpì e improvvisamente i suoi occhi si aprirono mentre la sua mente si afferrava disperatamente per l’ultima cosa che stava facendo. Non ricordava quando si era addormentata sul divano, ma sapeva che l'ultimo posto in cui era stata era sui cuscini troppo comodi. Non ha lottato, tuttavia, o combattere l'assenza di peso come era in braccia familiari. La sua testa si inclinò contro il petto di Sesshoumaru, confortandosi nel fatto che lui era qui e lei non era sola.<br/><br/>"Benvenuto di nuovo." La sua risposta fu un morbido ronzio di riconoscimento. Non aveva bisogno di parlare molto per farle capire le sue intenzioni, o il resto di quello che aveva da dire.<br/><br/>La portò di nuovo al suo letto, la collocò in esso con facilità. I suoi occhi incontrarono i suoi e lei sorrise facilmente perché non c’erano più ricordi alla deriva, non c’erano più ricordi scherzati su di lei. No, ogni volta che lui era vicino, lei non ricadeva mai in quei pensieri. Aveva aiutato, e gli anni avevano aiutato. Oggi è stato solo... uno di quei giorni.<br/><br/>"Dormo." Comandò con facilità, i suoi occhi rotolarono verso di lui, ma lei non combatté perché era stanca. La sua mano si aggrappò strettamente a lui, mentre sentiva la sua mano opposta premere sulla fronte per valutare il suo benessere.<br/><br/>"Sto bene", ha detto, le sue parole ferma con la sua promessa.<br/><br/>Stava bene, era viva, ed era felice.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>Spedizioniere<br/><br/>Riassunto<br/><br/>Kagome, a un certo punto della sua vita, era un'adolescente piuttosto regolare fino a quando è stata attaccata da un demone all'interno della casa del pozzo della sua famiglia. Il demone l'ha trascinata giù nel pozzo, che magicamente l'ha trasportata circa 500 anni nel passato. Lì, ha appreso che un gioiello sacro era racchiuso nel suo corpo in quanto era la reincarnazione di una sacerdotessa che era morta 50 anni prima del momento in cui è stata trascinata. Il gioiello è stato strappato dal suo corpo e il demone che l'ha trascinata nel tempo è stato sconfitto dal mezzo demone che ha liberato che è stato bloccato all'albero. Kagome fece amicizia con il mezzo demone, Inuyasha, nel tempo e viaggiò con lui per ripristinare il gioiello che lei stessa distrusse. Anche se non era così semplice e facile da fare come molti demoni e umani cercavano il gioiello per i propri scopi. Ha stretto amicizia con un giovane demone kitsune, un monaco e un cacciatore di demoni che hanno viaggiato con lei per ripristinare il gioiello.<br/><br/>Il suo gruppo, tuttavia, non è stato quello di completare il gioiello, ma un semidemone malvagio che ha manipolato la maggior parte degli eventi importanti nella maggior parte della vita del suo compagno. Quando finalmente raccolse tutti i pezzi del gioiello e fece il suo desiderio sull'oggetto contaminato, Kagome fu attirata nel gioiello stesso con l'intenzione di lei facendo un desiderio egoistico di tenerla intrappolata dentro per sempre, mantenendo il gioiello in vita. Fu la testardaggine di Inuyasha che riuscì a salvarla dall'oscurità. Alla fine, tornò al suo tempo naturale, terminando il liceo come ci si aspettava da una ragazza della sua linea temporale. Anche se giorni dopo, Kagome finì in Elysion. È stata in questo mondo per cinque anni, e da molto tempo ha rinunciato a tornare a casa. Si è sistemata felicemente nella sua nuova vita.<br/><br/>platonica<br/><br/>È piuttosto facile per Kagome fare nuove amicizie, non è cambiata molto dalla sua giovinezza. È una giovane donna allegra che è empatica e accogliente per la maggior parte della sua vita. Nella sua giovinezza, ha stretto amicizia con i demoni quando la maggior parte avrebbe paura di loro.

Detto questo, è davvero facile diventare sua amica finché qualcuno è in grado di dimostrare che è disposto a essere redento, o mostrare che non sono completamente malvagi. Si sente molto per tutti quelli che incontra, quindi è difficile per lei non essere attratta dagli altri nel desiderio di essere amici.<br/><br/>Antagonismo<br/><br/>L'unico modo per guadagnare l'ira di Kagome e' essere cosi' deplorevole, cosi' malvagia, e cosi' oltre la redenzione che lei non puo' vedere niente di buono in te. E lei puo' vedere il bene in praticamente tutti e in tutto. Un mezzo demone che metteva due amanti l'uno contro l'altro, che malediceva l'intera linea maschile di una delle sue amiche, e poi faceva uccidere la famiglia dal fratello della sua migliore amica... Sentiti libero di provarci, comunque.<br/><br/>romantico<br/><br/>Quando è innamorata, Kagome è un forte sostegno, rimanendo sempre lì anche quando le cose possono essere difficili. Tuttavia, Kagome non è alla ricerca dell'amore, non era alla ricerca dell'amore quando è arrivata in modo che le relazioni passate non esistano. Questo non vuol dire che qualcuno non si sia innamorato di lei. Può sicuramente essere oggetto dell'amore non corrisposto di qualcuno, ma probabilmente lo ignorerà.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Perché dovresti essere su Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Non sono, né ho mai affermato di essere, un guru dei social media. Sono solo una persona che pensa molto alle cose, e questo è successo un certo numero di volte.<br/><br/>Non sono un early adopter. A volte mi ci vogliono anni per capire per cosa voglio usare qualcosa prima di arrivarci, e Twitter era una di quelle cose. Sono stato su Twitter seriamente da circa febbraio di quest'anno, quindi sono abbastanza nuovo in questo. Tuttavia, ho imparato un certo numero di cose, e volevo condividerle. Alcune persone dicono che sono un pusher di Twitter, e lo sono, perché ci sono un sacco di buone ragioni per farlo, e praticamente nessun lato negativo.<br/><br/>Quindi cos'è Twitter? Se sei su Internet, probabilmente ne hai almeno sentito parlare. È un social network che serve come forum per conversazioni, aggiornamenti e notizie in un mezzo più pubblico di qualcosa come Facebook o LinkedIn. Facebook riguarda chi vuole trovarti, ma Twitter riguarda chi vuoi trovare. I tuoi scrittori, attori, politici, cantanti e scienziati preferiti sono probabilmente su Twitter. Così sono le tue organizzazioni di beneficenza, stazioni radiofoniche, siti di notizie e negozi preferiti. E vogliono che tu li trovi e ascolti quello che hanno da dire. Tutti su Twitter, almeno inizialmente, vogliono parlare con te.<br/><br/>Ma perché unirsi a questo? Perché essere parte di esso? Ci sono tutti i tipi di ragioni, e vi darò alcuni.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter è un ottimo modo per scoprire gli eventi che si svolgono in tutto il mondo, ma anche nella tua comunità. Se sei in viaggio e cerchi cose da fare, è un ottimo modo per scoprire cose rilevanti per i tuoi interessi (perché le persone che segui sono persone che ti interessano). Anche se non stai viaggiando, conoscere i posti migliori in cui andare localmente o sapere che le persone a cui sei interessato stanno andando da loro crea l'opportunità di incontrarli e creare un rapporto più profondo con loro. Se tornate al mio post del partito, tutte le persone in esso, tranne due, ne ho sentito parlare su Twitter e poi ci siamo incontrati nella vita reale, e ora siamo piuttosto buoni amici. E più lo fate, più cose scoprirete, e più persone incontrerete. E se li segui su Twitter, sai già un po 'di come sono. Vogliono che tu lo sia. Anche il contrario è vero, perché twittare invita le persone a vedere come sei, e possono fare le stesse scelte su di te.<br/><br/>Ispirazione e motivazione<br/>L'ispirazione viene dai posti più strani, e l'afflusso di tweet significa che c'è sempre un contenuto fresco per la tua immaginazione. Ho una prima politica di follow, quindi seguirò praticamente chiunque, e poi periodicamente passare attraverso e smettere di seguire le persone. Non so chi pianterà il seme di un nuovo post sul blog o di un nuovo progetto in me, quindi mi piace mantenere le mie opzioni aperte. La motivazione accade anche, perché Twitter è proprio come la vita. Se ti circondi di persone ambiziose, dedicate, generose e laboriose, è più facile essere così e spingerti. È più facile pensare che se possono pianificare eventi, lanciare progetti o semplicemente alzarsi la mattina, beh, anche tu puoi farlo.<br/><br/>I blogger di apprendimento e stile di vita sono su Twitter. I blogger che non lo sono possono effettivamente essere pazzi. E le persone blog su quasi tutto. Se stai cercando di imparare qualcosa, le probabilità sono buone che qualcuno stia twittando su di esso. Oltre a questo, i servizi di notizie e i negozi sono anche collegati, il che significa che puoi ottenere le tue notizie fino al minuto e scoprire le vendite e le offerte all'inizio. Per quanto riguarda lo stile di vita, alla ricerca di nuove idee di ricetta? Seguire alcuni ristoratori e vedere cosa arrivano con. Hai bisogno di una svolta per quel cocktail party? Twitter ha persone per questo troppo. Raccomandazioni guardaroba, o semplicemente vogliono vedere cosa fanno le altre persone con la loro vita? È tutto lì.<br/><br/>Ci sono alcune sfide comuni che affronto quando parlo di questo, e sono ostacoli legittimi. Può sembrare piuttosto scoraggiante, soprattutto se stai salendo sul carro in ritardo, come ho fatto io. Ho passato mesi seguendo solo due persone e non sapendo cos'altro fare. Ma ci sono modi per superarli, e sentire che sono dal meno frequente al più.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter è per i narcisisti<br/>Penso che questo provenga dall'idea che la maggior parte delle persone twitti per e su se stessi come un modo per attirare l'attenzione. Quello che non capisco è perché c'è qualcosa di sbagliato in questo, o perché fare questo ti rende un narcisista o uno stronzo. Se qualcuno ha qualcosa da dire, vuole essere ascoltato. Una volta ti trovavi all'angolo della strada e urlavi. Ora puoi urlare in 140 caratteri o meno. Twitter è solo un nuovo modo di essere ascoltato. Ora, ci sono certamente stronzi narcisisti su Twitter. Sono praticamente ovunque. A volte le persone sono stronze. A volte una di quelle persone sono io, mi dispiace dirlo. Non seguire quelle persone. Se non ti piace ciò che qualcuno sta dicendo, che si tratti di punti che stanno facendo o di resoconti dettagliati delle loro attività in bagno, non devi ascoltare su Twitter.<br/><br/>#2 Non riesco a tenere traccia di tutto<br/>Il secondo ostacolo che le persone spesso sollevano è che semplicemente non hanno il tempo di tenere traccia di tutte le cose che stanno accadendo su Twitter. E sai cosa? Va bene. Tieni traccia di ciò che puoi. Forse vaghi solo ogni pochi giorni. Se sei un utente privato (piuttosto che twittare per la tua azienda), e soprattutto un principiante, va bene. Parte di qualcosa è meglio di tutto il nulla.<br/><br/>#1 Non ho nulla che voglio mettere lì<br/>Questa è di gran lunga la sfida più frequente che le persone sollevano. E non importa nemmeno. Non devi unirti a Twitter per parlare. Unisciti ad esso per ascoltare. Ancora una volta, i tuoi autori preferiti, cantanti, blogger e giornali sono qui. Questa è la tua occasione per ascoltarli. È la tua occasione per avere una finestra sulle loro vite e attività, e ti stanno invitando a farlo. Vuoi scoprire cosa farà Felicia Day al San Diego Comic Con? Finito. Conosco persone che ascoltano solo su Twitter, ed è fantastico. Questo è quello che ho fatto per un po '. Alla fine, forse troverai qualcosa su cui twittare, o fare qualcosa su cui twittare. Spero che lo faccia, perché voglio sentirne parlare.<br/><br/>In breve, se non stai usando Twitter, penso che dovresti farlo. Se non lo stai usando in tutta la sua estensione, prova a farlo. Non aver paura di seguire cinquecento persone, se tutte quelle persone stanno dicendo cose che ti interessano. Invita quelle persone a fare un po' della tua vita e vedi come l'interazione migliora. Non vedo l'ora di sentirti. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Canali radice<br/><br/>Il solo pensiero di ottenere un canale radicolare mette la maggior parte delle persone sul bordo. SCM Dental utilizza le ultime tecnologie e tecniche per rendere un canale radicolare una procedura praticamente priva di dolore e a basso stress.<br/><br/>L'endodonzia rotativa è una tecnologia e una tecnica avanzate per eseguire il trattamento endodontico, il termine clinico per un canale radicolareIl termine "canale radicolare" si riferisce alla cavità naturale al centro del dente. Il nervo del dente si trova nel tessuto molle (polpa) all'interno del canale radicolare. Se il dente è danneggiato da un trauma o da una carie, i detriti possono entrare nell'area sensibile del canale radicolare e causare un'infezione o, in circostanze estreme, un ascesso. Un ascesso dentale è molto grave e dovrebbe essere trattato come un'emergenza, in quanto può creare un'infezione che può diffondersi ad altre parti del corpo. Se si ritiene di avere un ascesso dentale, contattare il nostro ufficio immediatamente per programmare le cure di emergenza.<br/><br/>A seconda del caso, la terapia del canale radicolare può richiedere più di una visita. Una radiografia iniziale sarà presa per valutare il dente e il canale radicolare e determinare l'entità del danno e dell'infezione se presente. Ti verrà somministrata una forma di anestesia per rilassarti.<br/><br/>Quando l'area è intorpidita, il nostro dentista creerà una camera di accesso al canale radicolare utilizzando un manipolo elettrico. Successivamente, il canale radicolare verrà raschiato dal tessuto e dal nervo infetti o danneggiati. Una volta che l’intera area è stata completamente pulita e lucidata, il dente sarà riempito con un composto di gomma biocompatibile chiamato gutta percha. Il dente viene quindi coperto con un otturatore dentale o corona dentale per ripristinare la forza e la funzione.<br/><br/>La terapia endodontica ha una cattiva reputazione come una procedura dolorosa. Con l'endodonzia rotativa, una procedura del canale radicolare non è più dolorosa di avere un otturatore dentale posizionato. L’infezione e il danno al nervo è ciò che crea il dolore estremo e il disagio e i pazienti sperimenteranno un significativo sollievo dopo aver subito la terapia del canale radicolare. I canali radicolari hanno un tasso di successo del 95% e consentono alle persone di preservare i loro denti naturali. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Cimitero Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Guarda tutti gli hotel di Highgate<br/><br/>Il bosco della regina<br/><br/>Tra il 1860 e il 1880 il centro fu strappato fuori dalla City di Londra per costruire fognature, ferrovie e nuove strade. Le case furono demolite senza riguardo per gli inquilini che dovevano trovare altrove qualsiasi alloggio potessero. I manager sono andati a vivere a Kensington e St. John's Wood, mentre i più poveri si sono affollati nelle rookeries come Seven Dials e Lisson Grove. Per quelli in mezzo, gli impiegati e gli operai qualificati, costruttori speculativi messo su fila dopo fila di ville a schiera e il signor Pooter si trasferì in Holloway. La gente di Muswell Hill ha visto le case strisciare attraverso i campi di Finsbury Park, su Crouch Hill e giù per l'altro lato, in modo che nel 1880, Crouch End si stava sviluppando e non sembrava esserci modo di fermare il flusso. Dieci anni dopo vennero vendute le grandi proprietà di Muswell Hill. Upton Farm fu venduta e i commissari ecclesiastici volevano sviluppare il Churchyard Bottom Wood, ora chiamato Queen's Wood. La storia avrebbe fatto una commedia di Ibsen. Due gruppi di persone oneste e molto motivate che combattono per ciò che ognuno di loro pensava fosse giusto. I commissari ecclesiastici da una parte e il Comitato delle Carità Hornsey dall'altra, entrambi credevano di fare del loro meglio per gli altri, e il pubblico si rivoltò contro di loro entrambi in indignazione.<br/><br/>A quel tempo Muswell Hill Road era una strada di campagna, con Southwood Hall ad un'estremità e Upton Farm all'altra. Nel 1894, fu costruito Onslow Gardens, Connaught Gardens segnato, e i costruttori erano pronti a sviluppare la tenuta Woodlands. Tagliato da Churchyard Bottom Wood era un gruppo di cottage abbattuti, su un sito triangolare. Una mappa non datata, tenuta dai commissari ecclesiastici, mostra sei Wasteland Cottages con un'apertura tra di loro - non una strada, non metallizzata, ma una strada attraverso i letti di fragole dietro. Più avanti c'era un'altra lacuna che portava a sentieri attraverso il bosco. Queste due aperture dovevano essere la base del piano. Le stesse due lacune e il terreno pulito, che era il campo di fragole, si possono vedere nella mappa del 1894 qui sotto. Essi sono mostrati come 'Muswell Hill Cottages' e, proprio per caso, Peter Sellers doveva vivere sullo stesso sito molto più tardi. Per sviluppare il legno come un complesso residenziale, i commissari dovevano guidare due strade attraverso da Muswell Hill Road e costruire case lungo di loro. La facciata di Muswell Hill Road da sola non avrebbe fornito spazio per abbastanza case per rendere l'avventura utile.<br/><br/>La terra e i cottage erano stati donati molto prima come case di elemosina per ospitare gli anziani e furono detenuti per loro conto dai Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. Di spirito pubblico, volendo fare il meglio per i loro vecchi inquilini, i trustee non potevano migliorarli poiché non avevano soldi. Alcuni anni prima i commissari ecclesiastici avevano pianificato di sviluppare Gravel Pit Wood (oggi Highgate Wood) come un complesso residenziale, ma questo aveva incontrato una tale opposizione che si sono ritirati. Invece, nel 1886, hanno dato tutti i 69 acri di bosco al pubblico. Allo stesso tempo si offrirono di vendere Churchyard Bottom Wood al Consiglio distrettuale urbano di Hornsey per £ 25.000, ma questo era troppo per Hornsey da raccogliere da solo. Il Consiglio ha detto che anche le persone che vivono al di fuori di Hornsey hanno goduto del bosco e altre autorità dovrebbero aiutare, ma nessun aiuto è stato dato.<br/><br/>Mappa che mostra i Muswell Hill Cottages che erano al centro della controversia.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road circa 1880<br/><br/>Sembra probabile che queste tre coppie di cottage siano state quelle al centro della controversia.<br/><br/>I commissari ecclesiastici volevano raccogliere fondi per il suo lavoro ecclesiastico in Gran Bretagna e all'estero. Ritenevano di aver ricevuto la terra per essere utilizzata per la propaganda della religione e se questo significava vendere terreni o boschi, era un male minore rispetto a limitare il lavoro della chiesa. Avevano dato Gravel Pit Wood al pubblico: al suo posto avrebbero sviluppato Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>I Trustees of the Hornsey Charities volevano produrre un reddito per aiutare i loro poveri, così hanno fatto un'offerta ai Commissari. Il loro pezzo di terra triangolare era troppo imbarazzante per essere sviluppato economicamente, ma se i commissari avrebbero concesso loro un po 'più di terra per renderlo un sito quadrato, avrebbero costruito venticinque ville ordinate. Ciò consentirebbe alla Commissione di tagliare due strade attraverso le loro terre in modo che i Commissari potessero sviluppare i boschi.<br/><br/>Quando questa offerta divenne nota, la gente reagì immediatamente con allarme.<br/><br/>Il 16 dicembre 1893 il deputato Carvell Williams chiese alla Camera dei Comuni, se i commissari ecclesiastici avessero acconsentito a vendere una striscia di terreno ai curatori di Hornsey Charities a condizione che una strada esistente fosse allargata a 40 piedi, se questo fosse un preliminare a uno schema di costruzione e se la Camera del Parlamento avrebbe avuto l'opportunità di esprimere un'opinione.<br/><br/>Il commissario Leveson Gower ha risposto «Sì» alla prima parte.<br/><br/>Mr. Carvell Williams, "Capisco che sia l'intenzione di distruggere quella parte di Highgate Woods costruendoci sopra?"<br/><br/>Due giorni dopo The Star pubblicò un articolo degno di ogni tabloid moderno.<br/><br/>La Stella<br/>18 dicembre 1893<br/><br/>«Il Parlamento deve vigilare attentamente su quei vecchi vandali e confederati dei commissari ecclesiastici, che alienano sempre un pezzo di terra o favoriscono i costruttori piuttosto che il pubblico in generale. I Commissari non avrebbero venduto il legno di Churchyard Bottom ai contribuenti, ma ora propongono di "aprirlo" tagliando due ampie strade attraverso di esso in connessione con uno dei loro numerosi schemi di costruzione. Qualcuno non farà una domanda in Parlamento e verificherà la politica dei Commissari in materia di mattoni e malta?».<br/><br/>Al momento della stampa, la domanda era stata posta e la risposta era o falsa o subdola. Altri documenti hanno ripreso la storia. Il Times, in una lunga relazione, ha detto che i Comnussioners non erano disposti a dare un impegno che il Parlamento, o qualsiasi altro ente pubblico, dovrebbe avere l'opportunità di prendere in considerazione qualsiasi schema per la costruzione sul sito del legno.<br/><br/>La situazione continuò a bollire per diciotto mesi fino a quando i commissari ecclesiastici furono costretti ad aprire un'inchiesta, che iniziò a Highgate il 31 maggio 1895, presieduta da un commissario ecclesiastico assistente. L'Inchiesta ha prodotto una serie di lettere di giornale di cui questo era il più importante.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 giugno 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMO A HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Signore...<br/><br/>Una delle zone boschive più belle della Londra suburbana è minacciata. Ci aiuterebbe a scongiurare quella che sarebbe una calamità, non solo per il quartiere immediato, ma per tutto il nord di Londra densamente popolato? In nessuna parte della metropoli il costruttore è stato più attivo che a Crouch End e Hornsey. I bei prati di un anno o due fa sono ora case e negozi. Pile di zavorra hanno preso il posto di olmi signorili e castagne, e una volta piacevoli villaggi stanno condividendo il destino di Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury e Islington.<br/><br/>---- L'oggetto è la costruzione di due strade di quaranta piedi attraverso i boschi. In questo quartiere conosciamo il significato di strade di quaranta piedi attraverso i boschi. Significa che i boschi sono condannati. Dieci anni fa l'agitazione ha salvato il bosco gemello di sessantacinque acri - il Gravel Pit Woods - e nessuno che ha visto la folla di Bank Holiday affollare la Strada dell'Arco dalle strade tristi di Holloway, Islington e Clerkenwell, e ha guardato il godimento acuto dei bambini e le feste della famiglia ha sempre fatto il picnic sull'erba e tra gli alberi, non poteva non realizzare l'immen ----<br/><br/>--- I commissari ecclesiastici possiedono quasi un terzo della grande parrocchia di Hornsey. Con la spesa liberale del denaro dei contribuenti per l'apertura delle strade e lo sviluppo generale del distretto, il valore della loro proprietà è stato enormemente aumentato, e da questo aumento non guadagnato essi traggono ogni anno grandi entrate. Sicuramente i contribuenti il cui denaro ha così contribuito a creare l’immensa tenuta possono aspettarsi un trattamento liberale in cambio.<br/><br/>Tuo obbediente,<br/><br/>Firmato dal Vicario di St James, Muswell Hill, il Ministro di Park Chapel, Crouch End, un avvocato che vive a Onslow Gardens e tre membri del Consiglio distrettuale.<br/><br/>I loro capi religiosi e il Consiglio di Distretto, tutti in armi, dicevano in effetti che la chiesa era troppo ricca e che doveva essere caritatevole, non avida. L'inclusione dei due ecclesiastici fu una mossa astuta. Ricordate che questo era ancora all'apice della controversia di Darwin. Darwin aveva diviso la fede negli insegnamenti della Chiesa e molte persone si sarebbero risentite del potere della Chiesa solo da questo punto di vista. La Chiesa non era così sicura come pretendeva di essere.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 giugno 1895 ha detto:<br/><br/>"Se i Comnusionari Ecclesiastici non vengono affrontati in una sola volta, il polpo da costruzione otterrà una presa del legno che sarà molto difficile da allentare in seguito, ---. Pertanto, è necessario che i londinesi si alzino e facciano se vogliono salvare uno dei loro pezzi più deliziosi di paesaggio rustico. L’inchiesta pubblica è stata rinviata a giovedì prossimo, e prima di allora bisogna fare qualcosa per convincere i commissari che i cittadini di Londra non tollereranno la confisca di uno dei loro campi da gioco preferiti.<br/><br/>Una lettera nel Daily Chronicle il giorno dopo diceva:<br/><br/>..... È stato con grande sollievo che i residenti, circa dieci anni fa, hanno sentito che l'acquisto del Bosco Superiore era stato effettuato; e quanto sia stata una deliziosa benedizione, chiunque li abbia visitati può testimoniare, ma tutti coloro che si sono sforzati di salvare questi boschi superiori, che si trovano sul lato ovest della strada Muswell Hill, hanno sentito che la loro vittoria era incompleta finché i sessanta acri sul lato orientale sono rimasti in pericolo. E’ quasi un caso che i boschi siano divisi da un’ampia strada alta. Qualcuno può dubitare quale sarebbe l’effetto se il cimitero di Bottom Wood fosse sostituito da file di piccole ville, ognuna delle quali invia il suo contributo di fumo e fuliggine? Qualcuno può dubitare, anche, della seria differenza che farebbe alla cornice pittoresca dei boschi acquistati se una linea di nuove case fissi dovesse essere corsa proprio di fronte alla loro frondosa facciata?<br/><br/>Questo ha espresso le opinioni di molte persone. Infatti, il Gravel Pit Wood, che lo scrittore chiama il 'Upper Wood', non era stato acquistato, ma dato al distretto dalla Commissione Ecclesiastica, un punto che dovevano ripetere più e più volte nel corso degli anni, ma la maggior parte della gente lo ignorava. La Commissione non avrebbe ceduto un secondo legname, a prescindere da quello che qualcuno avrebbe detto, e ha mantenuto questa posizione fino alla fine.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, di 5 Cranley Gardens, in una lettera al Times datata 8 giugno 1895, sollecitò l'acquisto.<br/><br/>So che è comune parlare aspramente dei Commissari Ecclesiastici, ma come i trustee di un fondo sono tenuti ad amministrarlo al massimo vantaggio, e quindi, se qualcosa deve essere fatto per salvare la demolizione del legno, mi sembra che possa essere effettuato solo con l'acquisto della proprietà dai Comnussions, che io so che hanno già una certa, sono pienamente vivi alla protezione del libero e spazio libero.<br/><br/>(Questo si riferisce al Crouch End Playing Fields che era stato assicurato pochi anni dopo.)<br/><br/>Come presidente della Muswell Hill Conservative Association, sono costantemente in contatto con gli abitanti, e posso affermare con sicurezza che ogni persona che risiede nel quartiere farebbe di tutto per preservare.<br/><br/>(Tutto ciò che voleva personalmente era un reddito di beneficenza per sostenere la sua povera gente. Ha chiesto il suo ettaro di terra - non molto sicuramente - credeva che la garanzia dei commissari che il bosco non era in pericolo.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road era una delle migliori di Hornsey e sarebbe rimasta altrettanto bella, case o nessuna casa.<br/><br/>(e poi arrivò la grande fioritura retorica.)<br/><br/>'I poveri devono soffrire a causa delle obiezioni sentimentali e del grido isterico del 'lupo appena sollevato dai vostri corrispondenti? Qualcosa deve essere fatto e che presto. Un acro di terra aggiunto alla proprietà della carità non farebbe alcuna differenza apparente per la terra rimanente, mentre il profitto derivante da esso soccorrerebbe molte persone povere anziane e meritevoli nei loro anni in declino e ci permetterebbe di consegnare ai nostri successori una proprietà che in un lontano futuro sarebbe di grande valore nel rendere aiuti caritatevoli ai poveri meritevoli della parrocchia di Hornsey.<br/><br/>Leggendo la sua lettera si percepisce l'isteria molto vicino alla superficie. Perché ha pensato che i commissari volessero costruire una strada? Perché dovrebbero spendere tutti quei soldi se non per costruire case? Non sembrò mai rendersi conto che per un acro di terra tutto il bosco sarebbe andato perduto, ma era stato con il problema per molto tempo. Era la persona a cui i commissari avevano fatto l'offerta di vendita per 25.000 sterline anni prima ed è il suo nome che è onorato in una targa sulla Crouch End Clock Tower per aver salvato il legno, ma la sua fiducia nei commissari ecclesiastici sembra ingenua. È triste che all’Inchiesta egli fosse stato gettato come il diavolo.<br/><br/>L'inchiesta continua<br/><br/>Il 15 giugno 1895 si aprì a Highgate l'attesa di un grande raduno, la sala del Consiglio era stata completamente cambiata, i soliti tavoli erano stati rimossi e la sala era piena di sedie. Verso le sette e mezza la stanza era affollata, con la gente che cercava posti a sedere.<br/><br/>Il commissario Murray ha detto che l'inchiesta è stata davvero semplice. Hornsey Parrochial Charities desiderava acquistare un pezzo di terreno adiacente alla loro proprietà di beneficenza sul retro. La domanda era se la Commissione della Carità, che controllava tutte le organizzazioni di beneficenza, avesse abbastanza potere per fermarle. I Commissari della Chiesa erano disposti a vendere la terra a condizioni molto favorevoli e il reddito della Carità sarebbe aumentato molto considerevolmente.<br/><br/>Ci sono tre classi di obiezioni.<br/><br/>Il Trust originale aveva lo scopo di fornire cottage per i poveri, ma i trustee stavano proponendo di costruire ville che sarebbero state troppo costose per i poveri. Tuttavia, era nel potere dei trustee di variare i termini del trust, in modo che potessero costruire ville se pensavano che i poveri avrebbero beneficiato alla fine. I poveri stessi potrebbero opporsi, ma le disposizioni liberali erano già state promesse per loro; la terza obiezione riguardava il lato estetico e pubblico della questione. Ha preso da ciò che aveva letto che la Commissione della Carità dovrebbe interferire per impedire ai commissari ecclesiastici di esercitare la propria discrezione nel trattare con la propria proprietà.<br/><br/>L'Inchiesta ha discusso punti fini, ma gli oratori hanno continuato a tornare al problema principale di impedire qualsiasi distruzione del legno. Il Vestry Clerk di Islington, in rappresentanza di 300.000 persone, fece una protesta formale su qualsiasi parte del bosco, così prezioso per la gente di Islington e Hornsey da essere utilizzato per scopi privati. Wilfred White ha affermato che, se i Commissari avessero dato loro tempo, sarebbero stati in grado di raccogliere i fondi per compensare gli amministratori fiduciari.<br/><br/>Il signor Beaumont ha detto che non volevano ville, volevano cottage per i poveri che venivano cacciati dal distretto. Altri hanno detto che non c'erano soldi per costruire cottage per sostituire quelli in rovina, ma le ville sarebbero state una proposta economica. Altri hanno risposto che c'erano decine di ville da affittare a Highgate. Il Bosco era sacro. Attenersi alla questione del legno.<br/><br/>Il dottor Fletcher ha detto che il grido tra la gente del lavoro era che non c'era nessun posto dove andare. La gente del lavoro si avvicinò a lui con il grido: "Siamo cacciati da Highgate e siamo obbligati ad andare a Highgate New Town." Se il fronteggiamento della Muswell Hill Road fosse stato venduto, non c'era dubbio, ma le strade potevano essere tagliate direttamente attraverso i boschi in direzione di Hornsey, ma se i commissari non potevano ottenere la terra dalla Charity Commission non potevano tagliare la strada.<br/><br/>Era molto sicuro che i cottage potessero essere messi in uno stato adeguato di riparazione. Gli è stato chiesto dai poveri, dalla polizia e da un certo numero di classi lavoratrici di rappresentare questi due punti, che l'alloggio cottage era molto dolorosamente necessario a Highgate e che se una volta hanno permesso che la terra fosse venduta, non c'era alcun indizio dove la mano del costruttore sarebbe stata fermata.<br/><br/>(Allegri e prolungati applausi).<br/><br/>Numerose altre persone hanno parlato e il Comnussioner ha riassunto dicendo che ha preso in considerazione che l'opinione prevalente era a favore della conservazione dei cottage, ma l'incontro non dovrebbe trarre conclusioni da ciò che aveva detto (Grilli).<br/><br/>Altri hanno detto che i trustee della carità avevano fallito nei loro doveri lasciando i cottage cadere in rovina.<br/><br/>Il signor H.R. Williams, il curatore che aveva scritto al giornale in precedenza, ha detto che aveva la migliore autorità che i Commissari della Chiesa non avrebbero fatto alcuna strada e non avrebbero beneficiato di un iota dalle azioni dei Commissari della Carità. Altri erano molto meno fiduciosi e la riunione si chiuse dopo quasi tre ore.<br/><br/>“Ci troviamo di fronte al fatto che a Highgate e Muswell Hill ci sono un certo numero di persone che vogliono il Churchyard Bottom Wood e non saranno felici finché non lo avranno ottenuto – mentre nessuno sembra disposto a spendere un penny per pagarlo. Tutti dicono che sarebbe bello avere il legno come spazio aperto, ma tutti pensano che sia dovere di qualcun altro renderlo uno. L'Islington Vestry ha 'risolto' l'argomento, ma l'Islington Vestry non offre un pezzo di un centesimo verso l'acquisto. Non c'è problema più difficile da risolvere per la comunità o l'individuo che come ottenere il possesso della proprietà di altre persone senza pagarla.<br/><br/>Pagare per questo era davvero il problema come Churchyard Bottom Wood divenne oggetto di intenso dibattito locale e nazionale. Un comitato congiunto è stato costituito per raccogliere fondi per salvare il legno. Il 20 novembre 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Onorevole Tesoriere, ha scritto a The Standard, un quotidiano di quel tempo, chiedendo aiuto. Ha ricordato a tutti il pericolo di perdere il legno e ha detto che poteva essere salvato solo acquistandolo. I Commissari della Chiesa avrebbero venduto per £ 25.000 e un extra (5.000 sarebbero stati necessari per recinzioni e drenaggio, per un totale di £ 30.000. Questo era troppo per il Consiglio di Hornsey da raccogliere, ma avevano già votato £ 10,000 per il totale. I boschi erano di inestimabile valore per tutto il nord di Londra, quindi fece appello agli enti pubblici e ai privati per raccogliere i restanti 20.000 sterline. Egli avvertì che l'offerta attuale dei Commissari della Chiesa era aperta solo alla fine del 1898. Dopo di che i costruttori si sarebbero trasferiti.<br/><br/>L'appello è stato accolto calorosamente dalla stampa. Un disegno di legge privato è stato affrettato attraverso il Parlamento e Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, divenne legge. Il Conunittee ora aveva il diritto di pubblicizzare i contributi per l'acquisto del Bosco e la sua conservazione.<br/><br/>In tempi relativamente brevi sono stati raccolti quasi tutti i fondi, ma le ultime migliaia si sono rivelate molto difficili da raccogliere e la scadenza dei Commissari era a poche settimane di distanza. Cory-Wright ha scritto chiedendo più tempo, ma gli è stato concesso un mero tre mesi e poi solo se gli interessi al 4 per cento sono stati pagati per il periodo supplementare sull'intera somma. Alla fine il Consiglio della Contea di Londra, che aveva originariamente offerto 2.500 sterline, ha fatto questo fino a 5.000 sterline e il totale è stato raggiunto, ma era una cosa a breve termine.<br/><br/>Il Consiglio ha deciso di rinominare il Bosco come 'Queen's Woods' in onore del Giubileo di Diamante della Regina Vittoria e Hornsey ha fatto una bella dimostrazione di abbandono quando la Duchessa di Albany ha formalmente dichiarato il Bosco aperto 'per il libero uso del pubblico per sempre'.<br/><br/>Mentre la campagna per salvare Churchyard Bottom Wood era gestita e diretta da persone locali che provavano passione per questo particolare pezzo di bosco, hanno fatto appello all'aiuto e all'esperienza di una vasta rete di persone, alcune delle quali avevano lavorato insieme a campagne simili per oltre trent'anni. Il Comitato ha lanciato un appello, stampato su carta di ottima qualità e recante alcuni nomi famosi.<br/><br/>Le questioni degli spazi aperti e della salute pubblica sono stati i temi principali della visione vittoriana.<br/><br/>Il movimento degli spazi aperti<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, la grande riformatrice delle abitazioni, che aveva iniziato con tre vecchie case a Marylebone, acquistate per lei da Jolm Ruskin, era rapidamente diventata un'esperta nell'alloggiare i poveri nelle condizioni più sane possibili. La sua strada era quella di comprare i contratti di locazione e poi abbattere alcune delle case affollate per portare luce e aria al resto, credendo che l'aria fresca e la luce del sole fossero l'unico modo in cui i poveri potevano essere salvati dalla 'febbre putrida. Aveva imparato questo da bambina dal nonno, Southwood Smith, che sviluppò le sue teorie al Fever Hospital di King's Cross.<br/><br/>Aveva costruito le prime abitazioni industriali per i poveri e aveva dimostrato statisticamente che una buona aria e un drenaggio decente salvavano vite. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, è un risultato diretto delle idee di Southwood Smith. Maggiori informazioni su Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>L'importanza dell'aria aperta<br/><br/>Gli spazi aperti e l'opportunità di respirare aria pulita, erano essenziali per le persone che vivevano in una o due stanze affollate. Octavia Hill ha preso le sue cariche dai baraccopoli di Lisson Grove, su Fitzjohn's Avenue a Hampstead Heath. Amava così tanto i campi di Fitzjohn's Avenue che cercò di comprarli come parco pubblico. Dovevano costare 10.000 sterline e entro tre settimane di agosto erano state raccolte 8.500 sterline. Aveva bisogno solo della fine delle vacanze estive e del ritorno da vacanze di amici simpatici e le ulteriori £ 1.500 sarebbero state raccolte, ma i proprietari hanno improvvisamente ritirato la loro offerta. Nonostante tutte le suppliche, i campi erano coperti di grandi case.<br/><br/>Da questo sviluppato la campagna per salvare Parliament Hill, il prossimo open space a nord di Lisson Grove, l'acquisto di campi nel percorso dei costruttori per fare un cordone sanitariore permanente contro i mattoni che avanzavano. La campagna di Parliament Hill Fields ebbe così tanto successo che il Hampstead Heath Bill fu approvato e dall'appello vennero spesi soldi. Da questi soldi e dall'impulso verso gli spazi aperti, fu sviluppato il National Trust. Octavia Hill era stata interessata a proteggere aree come Church Bottom Wood per anni, quindi è stata un'alleata naturale nella lotta per salvare il Bosco.<br/><br/>Anche la Commons Preservation Society aveva familiarità con questo tipo di agitazione e raccolta di denaro. Avevano abbattuto le recinzioni quando i signori del maniero avevano racchiuso pezzi di terra comune, conducendo battaglie legali e illegali contro l'arrogante privatizzazione di terre tradizionalmente libere. Robert Hunter, il loro Onorario Richiesto dal 1868, si è sempre preoccupato di garantire spazi aperti, grandi o piccoli, per il pubblico. Egli, ora Sir Robert Hunter, divenne il Presidente del Church Bottom Appeal. Il presidente della Commons Preservation Society fu il deputato Shaw-Lefevre (poi Lord Eversley) che giocò un ruolo importante in questa e in altre campagne alla Camera dei Comuni.<br/><br/>Allo stesso tempo Octavia Hill stava facendo campagna per un Burials Bill.<br/><br/>I cimiteri della città erano diventati così affollati e così pericolosi per la salute, contaminando i pozzi da cui la gente attingeva l’acqua potabile, che le sepolture della città non erano più permesse, ma si creavano cimiteri alla periferia della città. Il cimitero di Abney Park era uno di questi. C'era allora un movimento per rimuovere le lapidi ai bordi dei cimiteri della città vecchia, re-interrare i corpi altrove e trasformare i cimiteri in giardini e spazi aperti, invece di costruire su di loro. Questa terra nel centro di Londra era molto preziosa e gli speculatori erano ansiosi di ottenerla: anche i quaccheri avevano costruito sopra uno dei loro cimiteri e minacciavano di farlo di nuovo costruendo sopra Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill aveva una rete di alleati in una dozzina di campi, quindi il suo aiuto per salvare il Bosco di Fondo della Chiesa deve essere stato inestimabile.<br/><br/>La Metropolitan Gardens Society, fondata nel 1882, aveva disposto circa duecento piccoli giardini nei centri della città entro il 1890. In seguito li hanno consegnati alle autorità locali, quindi il loro sostegno al Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal è stato assicurato sin dall'inizio.<br/><br/>La Kyrle Society è ormai dimenticata, ma ai suoi tempi aveva una grande influenza sulla pianificazione urbana e sulla legislazione sugli spazi aperti. La Società era stata istituita intorno al 1875 per 'la Diffusione della Bellezza', per portare colore e interesse nella vita delle persone che vivono in ambienti opachi e opachi. Colore brillante alle pareti e alla decorazione, buon canto, spazi aperti, Natura, Letteratura e Arte. C'era un ramo decorativo, per il quale William Morris teneva lezioni; un ramo musicale per promuovere i cori e le sere felici per le persone negli edifici scolastici locali; e un ramo letterario. La Società faceva regolarmente appello con lettere al Times, alle "classi più ricche" per la distribuzione di libri e periodici ai club per ragazzi e ragazze, alle case di elemosina e altrove. Il nome "Kyrle" deriva da "L'uomo di Ross" di Pope, il filantropo che diede alla gente il suo luogo di nascita come parco pubblico. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Con il Ringraziamento dietro l'angolo, ecco alcuni giochi di cartelle di file festivi che abbiamo fatto per le ragazze. Entrambi i giochi del Ringraziamento si concentrano sulle abilità matematiche. E sono ancora una volta grato a mio marito, Ed, per aver fatto tutte le clipart per me.<br/><br/>Giorno del Ringraziamento<br/><br/>Come dice il nome, questo gioco riguarda la creazione di modelli. I piccoli imparano solo a conoscere i modelli, possono semplicemente abbinare le immagini sulle strisce del modello, mentre altri possono continuare il modello con le schede dell'immagine sulle strisce vuote.<br/><br/>Per fare la cartella del file, si desidera tagliare la griglia di immagini per fare i pezzi di carta. Vi consiglio di laminarli per aiutarli a durare più a lungo. Quindi incollare le strisce di modello verso il basso sulla cartella del file.<br/><br/>Volevo avere anche le strisce vuote del modello in modo che le ragazze potessero vedere dove continuare il modello e quante da stendere. Li ho attaccati al lato della cartella usando il nastro in modo che potessero piegarsi per impacchettare il gioco e estendere per layout del modello.<br/><br/>Ho anche aggiunto uno in più vuoto in modo che le ragazze potessero fare il proprio modello pure.<br/><br/>Gioco del numero della Turchia<br/><br/>In questo gioco le ragazze aggiungono le piume al corpo del tacchino mentre praticano il conteggio e il riconoscimento numerico. Ho usato le piume incolori per fungere da guida per dove aggiungere le piume e in modo che le ragazze potessero abbinare i numeri. E assicurati di incollare il corpo del tacchino solo incollare al centro in modo che i pezzi dell'ala possono scivolare sotto il corpo.<br/><br/>Una volta che tutte le piume sono disposte, pratichiamo una semplice aritmetica, come togliere tre piume e vedere quante ne rimangono, quindi aggiungerne due per vedere cosa equivale.<br/><br/>Oltre alle ali in bianco e nero, abbiamo anche incluso un tacchino incolore nel caso in cui si desidera avere i più piccoli colore il proprio set. Invece di un gioco di cartelle di file è possibile trasformare questo in un mestiere, colorare i pezzi, tagliarli fuori, e incollarli insieme.<br/><br/>Un'altra opzione è usare i pezzi per fare una storia di feltro. A volte cantiamo una versione di tacchino di 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Mi piace questo:<br/><br/>Chi sono io?<br/><br/>Penso che qui sia dove dovrei dire qualcosa di spiritoso su di me. Oh beh. Sono una mamma a casa di tre fantastici bambini - le nostre figlie gemelle che ora hanno sette anni e un figlio di due anni che è pieno di energia. Nella mia vita di pre-bambini ero un insegnante e ora istruisco a casa i nostri figli. Sono anche sposato con Ed, che attualmente serve nell'Aeronautica, ed è l'amore della mia vita (sarebbe imbarazzante se non lo fosse). La nostra famiglia è grande su libri, artigianato, e divertirsi insieme. Ho solo pensato di condividere le nostre attività nel mio piccolo angolo di internet.<br/><br/>Zoe sembra avere tutto - ricco, bello marito, vita facile di New York - ma ha commesso errori nel suo passato e quegli errori stanno tornando nella sua nuova vita. Mi sono trovato sul bordo del mio sedile per la maggior parte del libro ed è stato sorpreso ...<br/><br/>Ho amato questo libro, amo la storia, e sono grato Margot Shetterly ha portato alla luce. La mia unica lamentela è stata che vorrei che lei ha discusso il ruolo di Katherine Johnson nelle missioni successive un po 'di più, ma credo che la storia ha dovuto finire così ...<br/><br/>Volevo questo libro e l'ho fatto per la maggior parte. Dana scopre che il marito estraneo e la sua fidanzata sono stati trovati morti nel deserto del New Mexico. Sono stato immediatamente attratto dal suo personaggio e dalla storia. Mi è piaciuto molto seei... |
| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | L'uso di alcol da parte di persone di età inferiore ai 21 anni è stato identificato come un grave problema di salute pubblica. Gli studi notano che aumenta i rischi di disabilità e può essere dannoso per il cervello in via di sviluppo. I minori che bevono hanno maggiori probabilità di suicidarsi, infrangere la legge o essere vittime di violenza. L'alcol è coinvolto in quasi un terzo delle vittime del traffico giovanile. Il costo totale annuo del bere minori è stimato in $ 62 miliardi. Mentre la maggior parte delle leggi destinate a prevenire il consumo di bevande alcoliche da parte di minori sono approvate a livello statale, c'è stata attività legislativa e interesse a livello federale per sostenere gli sforzi degli stati per frenare il problema. La presente relazione descrive l'entità dell'uso di alcol da parte di minorenni, le recenti attività legislative in materia e le varie implicazioni politiche e verrà aggiornata man mano che saranno disponibili nuovi dati. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite. The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: cibo vero<br/><br/>La scorsa settimana ho scritto sul Manifesto del cibo nordico e su come la Danimarca abbia creato una forte cultura del “cibo vero” in gran parte da uno sforzo intenzionale guidato da Claus Meyer. Non sono state le lobby politiche o le petizioni pubbliche che hanno portato alla riforma alimentare, ma piuttosto uno sforzo di base guidato dai cittadini con il potere di attuare e seguire il cambiamento.<br/><br/>Ho finito il post alludendo a una domanda: perché è così difficile per noi fare questo da soli, come individui? Se un intero paese può implementare e diffondere una visione comune verso il cibo, perché non possiamo?<br/><br/>Non c'è niente che ci impedisca di imitare il successo della Danimarca. Il problema è che siamo inondati da tanti messaggi su cosa dovremmo mangiare e come dovremmo vivere, è difficile sapere da dove iniziare. Quindi, piuttosto che seguire framework di successo che hanno dimostrato di funzionare (come il Manifesto del cibo nordico), la maggior parte delle persone salta dalla mania della dieta alla mania della dieta, cercando di trovare il "modo giusto per mangiare".<br/><br/>Ma come è riuscito Claus Meyer? Qual è stata la salsa segreta che ha aiutato il Manifesto a prendere piede? Ed è ragionevole pensare che possiamo applicare queste lezioni alle nostre vite?
