| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense.

È stato insignito del "Miglior poeta 2014 e 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in un kimono giapponese, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio pubblico], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Breve storia della poesia collaborativa, collettiva o a catena<br/><br/>La poesia collaborativa, collettiva o a catena è una tecnica alternativa e creativa per scrivere poesie da più di una persona. Lo scopo principale di questo tipo di poesia è quello di creare poesie attraverso la collaborazione di vari autori / poeti, cercando di formare una voce unificata pur mantenendo le loro voci individuali.<br/><br/>Gli esempi di collaborazione abbondano nella poesia giapponese, anche se i resoconti e le registrazioni precise di molti di questi eventi sono persi o mancano.<br/><br/>Uno degli esempi più famosi di scrittura poetica collettiva è la raccolta di poesie intitolata Ralentir Travaux dei poeti surreali francesi André Breton, Paul Éluard e René Char. Questi tre poeti collaborarono per scrivere le poesie di questa raccolta in soli cinque giorni nel 1930.<br/><br/>Durante gli anni '40, Charles Henri Ford, un poeta americano, inventò quella che chiamò "poesia a catena", in cui ogni poeta scrisse una riga e poi inviò la poesia a un'altra persona (per continuare) in un'altra parte del mondo, per posta.<br/><br/>Nel 2007 una raccolta di poesie collaborative americane Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry è stata curata e pubblicata da Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton e David Trinidad.<br/><br/>La scrittura poetica collaborativa è stata utilizzata nelle scuole e nei college per insegnare agli studenti il lavoro di squadra e per scoprire i modi in cui sono connessi.<br/><br/>Studio di una figura all'aperto: donna con un ombrellone, rivolto a sinistra, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio pubblico o dominio pubblico], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Lo scopo di questo articolo e come affrontare la sfida<br/><br/>Qualche anno fa ho scritto un articolo intitolato "Poem Without a End" che includeva una poesia natalizia a cui mi ero prestata ad essere aggiunta. Sono rimasta stupita dalla risposta in quanto a quel punto avevo solo pochi follower qui. La gente ha scritto una strofa di poesia ciascuno in "commenti" sull'hub per seguire dalla strofa del commentatore precedente. Ha funzionato molto bene e alla fine ho compilato tutti i contributi in un'unica poesia come parte dell'hub.<br/><br/>Sfide simili sono state emesse da allora, tra cui una di Frank Atanacio chiamata "Spirits Sat as Mourners" che ebbe anche molto successo. La differenza è che in quel caso i collaboratori hanno scritto i loro hub per la loro strofa di poesia e hanno inserito un link all'hub originale di Frank.<br/><br/>Per questa particolare sfida non mi aspetto che tutti passino un tempo prezioso a scrivere hub separati per una sola strofa di poesia (a meno che tu non lo voglia davvero). Il problema principale è che per renderlo efficace dovreste copiare le parti precedentemente scritte della poesia sul vostro hub e probabilmente verreste colpiti dall'etichetta "duplicazione".<br/><br/>Quindi, essendo questo il caso, e anche per evitare di dover lasciare link ovunque, chiedo solo che chiunque voglia partecipare scriva la sua strofa qui in "commenti". Controlla l'ultimo commento prima del tuo che sta contribuendo alla sfida e segui. Se vedo più di un seguito dalla stessa strofa, userò la mia licenza poetica per lavorarli nel modo che ritengo migliore.<br/><br/>Ad un certo punto, quando sento che ci sono state abbastanza strofe aggiunte, probabilmente chiamerò la fine della sfida e poi le compilerò tutte insieme come la poesia completata come parte dell'articolo (dando anche credito a ciascun contributore).<br/><br/>Fiorisce Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Dominio pubblico], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>La sfida!<br/><br/>Ora arriva la parte interessante. Se ti unisci a questa sfida di poesia a catena devi cercare di mantenere lo stile e la voce della poesia il più vicino possibile ai versi precedenti, in modo che ai lettori disinformati sembri che solo un autore abbia scritto l'intera poesia.<br/><br/>Suona facile, dici? Beh forse sarebbe se la poesia avesse uno stile tradizionale, rima o metro. Ma questo no! La poesia che aggiungerai è stata iniziata da una mia conoscenza Andriealphus come una "chain poem challenge" altrove. Al momento della scrittura ero l'unica altra persona che aveva accettato la sfida, e poiché amavo l'argomento ho pensato che sarebbe stata una grande sfida per i miei colleghi scrittori e ho deciso di usarlo qui e vedere se la risposta sarebbe stata migliore. (Conosco alcuni poeti qui la cui scrittura si adatterebbe a questo stile)<br/><br/>Regole:<br/><br/>Segui dalla strofa precedente nei commenti<br/><br/>Cerca di mantenere la voce e lo stile della poesia<br/><br/>Mantieni la tua strofa/verso all'incirca alla stessa lunghezza di quelle precedenti<br/><br/>Claude Monet è stato uno dei pittori più famosi della storia dell'arte e una figura di spicco nel movimento impressionista.<br/><br/>Nel 1883 Monet si trasferisce a Giverny, dove ama dipingere all'aperto nei giardini che ha contribuito a creare. I gigli d'acqua trovati nello stagno avevano un particolare fascino, e ne dipinse diverse serie per il resto della sua vita; anche il ponte in stile giapponese sopra lo stagno divenne oggetto di diverse opere.<br/><br/>Nel 1912 Monet dipinse una serie di 12 dipinti di ninfee commissionati dall'Orangerie des Tuileries, un museo di Parigi. Scelse di realizzarli su larga scala e di servire come "rifugio di meditazione pacifica". Questo progetto ha consumato gran parte degli ultimi anni di Monet. Monet una volta ha dichiarato: "Questi paesaggi di acqua e riflessione sono diventati un'ossessione per me. È oltre le mie forze da vecchio, eppure voglio rendere ciò che sento."<br/><br/>Quasi cieco, con entrambi gli occhi gravemente colpiti dalla cataratta, Monet alla fine accettò di sottoporsi a un intervento chirurgico per la malattia nel 1923.<br/><br/>I famosi gigli d'acqua di Monet diventarono più rossi mentre la sua cataratta progrediva. Dopo aver subito un intervento chirurgico correttivo, distrusse la maggior parte dei dipinti "gigli rossi", arrabbiato che nessuno gliel'avesse mai detto. Ironia della sorte, questi dipinti sono stati probabilmente ciò che ha reso il suo stile impressionista così famoso in quel momento - gli artisti hanno iniziato a correre più rischi con il colore e simili durante questo punto.<br/><br/>Il capolavoro<br/><br/>Il ragazzo seduto dietro di te dice che sembri un capolavoro.<br/><br/>Chiedetegli: ha mai visto un Monet da vicino?<br/><br/>Abbastanza vicino da non vedere nient'altro che colpi confusi di erbaceo sulla riva del lago?<br/><br/>Abbastanza vicino da immergere le dita nelle creste<br/><br/>dove le pitture ad olio si induriscono sotto lo sguardo di un artista?<br/><br/>Abbastanza vicino da respirare sui gigli di sangue?<br/><br/>Chiedigli, perché li ha dipinti di rosso?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Sorrideva come il gatto di Cheshire di Carroll.<br/><br/>Attraverso occhi nuvolosi e sanguinosi immagino.<br/><br/>Siate i miei gigli d'acqua!" dice,<br/><br/>"Senti il mio respiro e lascia che le mie dita scavino,<br/><br/>Diventa il mio capolavoro.<br/><br/>Un pennello non ha mai toccato una tela così fine come la tua pelle chiara.<br/><br/>I padroni piangano di gelosia,<br/><br/>e Van Gogh tagliare il suo orecchio in invidia alla bellezza della tua nudità.<br/><br/>Autoritratto con orecchio bendato<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Dominio pubblico], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Risposte<br/><br/>Ora è il tuo turno.

Penso che potrei avere tutti i versi che stanno per venire. Ho fatto del mio meglio per organizzarli come penso che sia meglio con solo un po 'di editing. Probabilmente pubblicherò il poema finito come un hub separato con un link su questo. Il mio libro è disponibile su Lulu e iBooks... c'è un link su uno dei commenti precedenti. Apprezzerei davvero se doveste purhase una copia. Tenete a mente che è il mio primo eBook in modo che la formattazione ecc non è perfetto, ma mi ha preso sette revisioni penso di portarlo dove è. Sarà tutto più facile la prossima volta. Se avete bisogno di aiuto fatemelo sapere.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia il 12 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ciao John, hai sicuramente avuto alcune ottime risposte alla tua sfida - sono sicuro che lo fonderai del tutto magnificamente anche se immagino un compito difficile. Mi interessano anche i tuoi libri di poesia - devo davvero mettere insieme il mio atto tecnologicamente - proverò a controllare tutto... ciao -<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 11 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ciao Jo, entrambi i libri 'On the Wings of Eagles' e "I Laughed a Smile" hanno per lo più lo stesso contenuto... tranne il primo ha una poesia in più. Originariamente erano in formati diversi, un ePub, l'altro PDF ma ora sono entrambi ePub. Sono disponibili tramite Lulu e iBooks, presto Barnes and Noble e Nook (non Amazon). Potrei provare a pubblicare un altro libro su Amazon presto solo per vedere come si confronta. Grazie ancora.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues da Lincolnshire, U.K. il 11 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>John, grazie mille, le informazioni sulla pubblicazione con Lulu saranno abbastanza utili come sto pensando di pubblicare, ma al momento sono diviso tra Amazon e Lulu. Volevo acquistare uno dei tuoi libri, ma non riuscivo a trovarli su Amazon. Comunque, probabilmente l'avro' da Lulu, augurandoti ogni successo, te lo meriti.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 11 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ehi Phyllis, grazie per il tuo commento.

Aspetto solo di vedere se c'è altro da aggiungere. Pubblicare con Lulu non è stato male e ora che l'ho fatto una volta sarà più facile la prossima volta. Ottenere la formattazione per guardare bene nell'eBook è stato il più difficile, anche se è sufficiente digitarlo in un documento di parola e Lulu produce automaticamente la pagina dei contenuti e converte il documento in ePub o PDF. È possibile utilizzare solo determinati font e devono assicurarsi che i nomi dei capitoli o i titoli delle poesie siano nell'intestazione 1. Forniscono anche un numero ISBN gratuito se lo si desidera. Nel complesso, tuttavia, è stato più facile del previsto.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues da Lincolnshire, U.K. il 11 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, questo è sintetico e bello, lo adoro.

Come hai trovato il processo di pubblicazione con Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 10 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>No, non è troppo tardi, sto ancora compilando la poesia finale quindi dovrebbe essere tutto da vedere in un giorno o due.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper dal sud degli Stati Uniti il 10 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ciao John,<br/><br/>Mi scuso per la mia presentazione tardiva qui alla vostra sfida meravigliosa.

Grazie a tutti coloro che hanno contribuito.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 2 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Grazie Genna. Sembra che Monet sia un arist preferito da molti qui. Spero che parteciperete anche voi a questa sfida :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 2 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Grazie per il grande contributo Shyron. Questo è un versetto molto bello. Ben fatto.<br/><br/>Genna East da Massachusetts, USA il 02 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ciao John...<br/><br/>Ho iniziato a leggere questa meravigliosa sfida (Monet è uno dei miei artisti preferiti), poi sono tornato per finire di leggere alcuni dei bellissimi contributi che danno a questo dipinto una voce mozzafiato attraverso la percezione e i sensi.

Prenditi cura e il mio meglio per te.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Grazie Deb, sì, sono impressionato dallo standard di presentazione. Non vedo l'ora di mettere tutto insieme.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Sì Ann, è bello vedere i poeti tra noi prendere la sfida con alcuni grandi contributi finora. Spero solo che Imcan faccia giustizia quando si tratta di metterla insieme.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ben fatto Jo. La parola "sublime" mi viene in mente. Speravo che tutti i poeti sarebbero saliti in primo piano, e lo hanno fatto. Lo amo, grazie per aver contribuito.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt da Stillwater, OK il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Non vedo l'ora di vedere che fine fate qui. Ci sono un certo numero di poeti raffinati che si alzano alla sfida, quindi andateci!<br/><br/>Ann Carr da SW England il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Fantastico, Jo!<br/><br/>Hai fatto partire tutti, John! Piuttosto che me, mettendo insieme tutto questo, ma sarà un umidificatore di una poesia quando finalmente arriverà alla fine - se mai lo farà! Hai davvero iniziato qualcosa.<br/><br/>Ann (personaggio)<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues da Lincolnshire, U.K. il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John qui non va niente! Seguendo da Kim. Spero che si legga bene.<br/><br/>E il ragazzo cominciò a camminare via<br/><br/>Ma sulla sua scia, l'ho sentito dire<br/><br/>"Ho fatto un viaggio all'Orangerie<br/><br/>Dove il fantasma di Monet dimora ancora<br/><br/>Mi sono seduto e ho guardato per un po '<br/><br/>Fino a quando non ho sentito una voce morbida piangere.<br/><br/>"Hai mai visto un sogno fluido?<br/><br/>Dove la luce si evolve in ciò che tocca<br/><br/>Dove la serenità scorre attraverso il velo nuvoloso<br/><br/>Dove la spazzola del mago corre come un fulmine<br/><br/>Avete mai visto uno spettacolo sublime?<br/><br/>Un bambino nato da un’illusione distorta<br/><br/>Questo stagno fiorito che intrappola la luce<br/><br/>Che solleva il cuore e fa cenno all'anima<br/><br/>Un astratto pulchritude su vicino<br/><br/>Ritornate indietro, ecco; una delizia così tranquilla».<br/><br/>Spero che questo sia in linea con quello che gli altri hanno fatto. Sentitevi liberi di modificare se necessario. Il mio meglio...<br/><br/>- Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues da Lincolnshire, U.K. il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Va bene.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>Sì Jo, per favore. Chiunque è invitato a fare più di una strofa. Posso aggiungere un'altra io stesso ad un certo punto.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues da Lincolnshire, U.K. il 01 agosto 2015:<br/><br/>John, ho deciso di andare, ma sono circa 16 righe, posso farlo in due strofe dopo la meravigliosa presentazione di Kim? Puoi sempre modificarlo più tardi.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 31 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Ciao Jo, mi dispiace sentire che sei sotto il tempo in questo momento. Non ho fretta di chiudere questa sfida quindi la terrò aperta fino a quando non sarai di nuovo a fuoco su tutti i cilindri e sarai in grado di contribuire. Sei uno dei bulli che non vedevo l'ora di ricevere una risposta da come ho pensato che sarebbe adatto. Grazie per le tue gentili parole, e guarire presto.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues da Lincolnshire, U.K. il 31 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Non riesco a credere di aver quasi perso la tua incredibile sfida. Questo è qualcosa a cui avrei voluto partecipare poiché Claude Monet è uno dei miei artisti preferiti di tutti i tempi. Purtroppo, devo piangere. Sono un po 'sotto il tempo con la testa piena di cotone, o così sembra. Se la sfida è ancora aperta quando mi sbarazzo di questa fastidiosa influenza potrei dare un'occhiata, ma devo dire, lo standard è eccezionalmente alto. Maj lo ha portato ad un altro livello ma tutte le proposte sono brillanti. Complimenti a te Andriealphus e agli altri scrittori che hanno partecipato finora a questo capolavoro artistico e creativo.<br/><br/>Il mio meglio sempre Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 31 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Ciao ancora Maj, sono contento che questa poesia ti abbia ispirato, e sì batte guardare il cricket soprattutto con i battitori australiani che si comportano male in questa terza prova. Sarà un esercizio interessante per me fondere tutte le strofe insieme, ma dovrebbe essere buono.<br/><br/>travmaj da australia il 30 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>John, grazie, sono molto felice che ti piaccia la mia offerta. Ho trovato la poesia intrigante e improvvisamente mi sono sentita ispirata a scrivere la mia versione nella stessa modalità. Non sono sicuro di aver scritto una continuazione della strofa prima (sempre esplorando) ma sono sicuro che la fonderete del tutto quando arriverà il momento. Adoro tutte le risposte. Non sono riuscita a scrivere nulla di creativo per gli yonks, non vedo l'ora di ricominciare da capo, mi serve solo un po' di tempo. (battiti guardando anche il cricket!!!)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 30 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Grazie per aver controllato Dana. Sono soddisfatto della qualità delle risposte finora. Devo solo aspettare e vedere quanti altri arrivano. Il finale, il poema dovrebbe essere grande.<br/><br/>Dana Tate da LOS ANGELES il 30 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Solo controllando per vedere come stanno andando le cose, non vedo l'ora per il prodotto finito. Ho frequentato un corso di poesia e abbiamo fatto questo anche è stato davvero divertente.<br/><br/>ocfireflies da North Carolina il 29 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Grazie mille per aver fornito la piattaforma per senza che sia facile cadere.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 29 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Grazie Devika, non ti vedo da un po', spero che tutto vada bene.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autore) da Gondwana Land il 29 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>Bellissimo lavoro Kim. Seguirà perfettamente da Maj come hai risposto alla domanda GIverny. Sono così soddisfatto della qualità delle risposte finora.<br/><br/>ocfireflies da North Carolina il 29 luglio 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>L'avevo inviato prima dell'incredibile contributo di travmaj, ma forse funziona ancora (ho fatto un po' di modifiche)<br/><br/>Seguendo in contrasto con il precedente - non so se<br/><br/>Sto facendo qualche senso. Se non funziona, non esitate a cancellare e ci riproverò. |

We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | In primo luogo, EEQT stesso deve essere ulteriormente sviluppato al fine di fornire una risposta teorica e computazionale alle esigenze della moderna ingegneria quantistica e della tecnologia. Abbiamo bisogno di includere sistemi classici con un numero infinito di gradi di libertà - come il campo elettromagnetico e / o gravitazionale. Abbiamo anche bisogno di includere sistemi quantistici infiniti in modo da comprendere e simulare il gas di Bose e le sue transizioni di fase. Ma ci sono anche passi che devono essere fatti ben oltre il paradigma dell’EEQT.<br/>Come abbiamo sottolineato tante volte: la teoria quantistica deve ancora essere compresa in termini di “teoria classica non lineare”. Ma ciò che intendiamo per "teoria classica" è qualcosa di molto più avanzato e più generale della meccanica classica o della teoria classica dei campi. Per "teoria classica" intendiamo prima di tutto una teoria che non si basa sulle probabilità fin dall'inizio; una teoria in cui le probabilità appaiono in una fase successiva, derivate dalla teoria; derivate forse, in modo necessario. Tale teoria deve non solo specificare gli oggetti matematici e le loro relazioni, ma anche fare "predizioni".<br/>Una teoria classica è, in particolare, una teoria in cui possono accadere eventi discreti, eventi che sono "oggettivi". Possono essere eventi che interessano principalmente lo strato fisico, ma possono anche essere "eventi mentali", cambiamenti di stati di "coscienza"; qualunque cosa siano, anche se sono interessati a ramificazioni di universi, - ACCEDENNO.<br/>Una tale teoria, che comprende la teoria quantistica come la conosciamo oggi, non esiste ancora, ma possiamo immaginare la sua forma possibile. Niente serve meglio di un esempio, quindi diamo qui un esempio di come una tale teoria può essere interpretata.<br/>Immaginate una teoria sviluppata dalla teoria del campo unificato di Einstein, ma con la firma metrica variabile, possibilmente con una rete causale complessa, multipla.<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (vedi anche [41]) ponti, cicli temporali, non differenziabilità, struttura frattale, il tutto ulteriormente complicato dalla dimensione variabile dello spazio e del "tempo" (cfr. Immaginate una tale teoria per essere in grado di accomodare tutte le quattro forze fondamentali che conosciamo, ma coinvolge anche un campo in più, che è diverso dai campi fisici, e che non è locale nel senso che non sopravvive prendendo un limite di macro-media quando la struttura causale spazio-tempo della relatività generale di Einstein viene recuperata. Questo campo in più sarebbe un luogo per "forme di pensiero" e la nostra teoria accoppierebbe queste forme di pensiero a livelli più "fisici" della realtà.<br/>Nulla impedisce che una teoria di questo tipo abbia strutture matematiche abbastanza ricche da accomodare la coscienza e la mente. A causa della sua complessità, densità di cicli temporali, struttura causale simile a una bolla, fare previsioni in tale teoria è possibile solo applicando la probabilità.<br/>come nel caso dei sistemi che evolvono secondo dinamiche deterministiche ma caotiche. La funzione d'onda quantistica emergerebbe in tale teoria come un modo efficace di prevedere. Questo tipo di spiegazione dell’indeterminismo quantistico è stata postulata molto tempo fa da I. J. Good.<br/>[3] ha ipotizzato che l'indeterminismo quantistico può essere compreso se ammettiamo che gli eventi quantistici individuali che effettivamente accadono qui e ora hanno future cause avanzate hanno anche cause ritardate passate.<br/>Un assaggio di tale pensiero potrebbe essere apparso ad Alan Turing quando ha scritto la sua famosa frase, già citata: "la previsione deve essere lineare, la descrizione deve essere non lineare".<br/>Una teoria che va parzialmente in questa direzione è stata sviluppata da L. Nottale.<br/>[43] che afferma l'osservazione, attribuita a Feynman, che "i percorsi tipici delle particelle di meccanica quantistica sono continui non differenziabili." Il comportamento quantistico diventa, in questa teoria, una manifestazione della geometria frattale dello spazio-tempo, nello stesso modo in cui la gravitazione è, nella teoria di Einstein della relatività generale (movimento), una manifestazione della curvatura dello spazio-tempo.<br/>Un altro passo in questa direzione proviene dal lavoro degli scienziati russi - che è iniziato con le idee più originali di N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>e A. Sakharov [45], e si sta sviluppando a Mosca, negli Urali e in Siberia, vedi ad esempio [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Miglior nutrizione ed esercizio per perdere peso<br/><br/>In che modo la colazione è davvero sana?<br/><br/>Al mattino come un imperatore, a mezzogiorno come un re, alla sera come un mendicante – va un proverbio ben noto. Uno studio dell'organizzazione medica Endocrine Society conferma il messaggio chiave dietro il detto: mostra che la colazione svolge un ruolo più importante di quanto spesso si pensi. Al mattino, il corpo umano ha in realtà più del doppio dell’attività metabolica rispetto ad altri momenti della giornata: una colazione abbondante non solo ti mantiene pieno per un lungo periodo di tempo, ma anche i livelli di zucchero nel sangue e di insulina aumentano lentamente. L'appetito per i dolci è regolato, mangiamo snack meno spesso durante il giorno. Pertanto, la colazione non dovrebbe essere saltata anche durante una dieta.<br/><br/>Naturalmente, avere una grande colazione non significa che dovremmo avere diversi croissant con crema di torrone di noci e pancake dolci per la colazione al mattino. La colazione è salutare quando è ricca di proteine e fibre, oltre a fornire vitamine e minerali. Pane integrale o muesli, fiocchi d'avena, frutta e noci sono fornitori di energia che sono buoni per te e ti tengono pieno per molto tempo.<br/><br/>Il fatto che una grande colazione sia migliore di una grande cena non significa necessariamente che la colazione sia essenziale per perdere peso. Una meta-analisi condotta nel 2019 ha mostrato che l’apporto energetico giornaliero totale delle persone che fanno colazione è in media superiore a quello di coloro che non fanno colazione. Questi ultimi erano in media poco meno di mezzo chilo più leggeri. Quindi, secondo i risultati di questo importante studio, non devi necessariamente fare colazione se vuoi perdere peso.<br/><br/>Perdere peso con la dieta giusta – ecco come è facile mettere sano nel vostro piatto<br/><br/>Mangiare sano non significa in alcun modo meno gusto. Verdure fresche, pesce o carne come fonti di proteine e altri ingredienti sani evocano il gusto nella pentola e un sorriso sulle labbra, idealmente anche quando si calpestano le scale. Uno studio statunitense ha dimostrato che le persone che cucinano il proprio cibo e si occupano consapevolmente di ciò che mangiano hanno un indice di massa corporea nell’intervallo normale. Le visite al ristorante o il fast food, d'altra parte, ti attirano rapidamente nella trappola dello zucchero: spesso non c'è alcuna indicazione di quanto zucchero è nei condimenti per insalate, di quanto grasso le patate sono state fritte o se la carne non è stata trattata.<br/><br/>Un pranzo sano è composto da tre parti: la maggior parte è costituita da frutta o verdura e dovrebbe coprire metà del piatto. Un quarto del pasto dovrebbe essere costituito da proteine, cioè pesce, carne o tofu. Il quarto rimanente è costituito da carboidrati ed è idealmente fatto di prodotti a base di cereali integrali. Importante: Non mangiare alla scrivania in ufficio, ma stimolare il metabolismo e idealmente fare una breve passeggiata prima o dopo pranzo.<br/><br/>Quando si dovrebbe mangiare per perdere peso?<br/><br/>La sera, dovresti concentrarti su pasti leggeri che sono piuttosto a basso contenuto di carboidrati. Questi sono i meno propensi a causare l'insulina a salire alle stelle, il che è un bene per il nostro corpo. Verdure, latticini e noci, per esempio, sono ben adatti per questo.<br/><br/>Dovresti anche stare attento a non cenare troppo tardi. È meglio aver mangiato fino alle 19:00 – quindi il corpo può rilassarsi e prepararsi per la notte. Un sonno sufficiente è importante per una sana perdita di peso. Uno studio statunitense ha scoperto che le persone che dormivano circa otto ore a notte avevano depositi di grasso migliori. Quindi buona notte! Concediti più di sei ore di sonno in modo da poter iniziare il giorno successivo in forma e rinfrescato.<br/><br/>Perdere peso senza esercizio fisico: è davvero possibile?<br/><br/>Sarebbe così facile, se il peso dei sogni potesse essere raggiunto semplicemente abbassando l'apporto calorico. Ma probabilmente conosci la saggezza che la dieta è solo un lato della moneta e l'esercizio è l'altro. Quindi nulla aiuta: Mettiti l'abbigliamento sportivo e vai!<br/><br/>Chiunque, oltre al programma sportivo come fare jogging, camminare o nuotare, lascia anche l’ascensore andare da solo e prende le scale, fa una piccola deviazione o usa la bicicletta al posto dell’auto, sta facendo wellis anche chiamato qualcosa di buono. Anche una semplice camminata fa bene alla salute. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Perché abbiamo aperto il server di applicazioni Anvil<br/><br/>Perché l’open source?<br/><br/>Un po’ di tempo fa, abbiamo aperto l’Anvil App Server. La reazione della comunità è stata grande, anche un po’ schiacciante (sì, ogni risposta a quell’annuncio è davvero arrivata nella mia casella di posta!). Abbiamo già incorporato un sacco di feedback nella nostra versione 1.2, ma continuiamo a chiederci: "Perché hai aperto una parte così importante del tuo prodotto?"<br/><br/>Perche' lo fate?<br/><br/>Anvil è uno strumento che rende il più semplice possibile costruire un'applicazione web. Lo facciamo consentendo di costruire l'intera applicazione in un unico linguaggio, Python.<br/><br/>Il semplice hosting fa parte di questo.<br/><br/>La piattaforma web è rotta e Anvil è il nostro tentativo di risolverlo. E, poiché c'è così tanta complessità nell'implementazione di un'app web, un servizio ospitato nel cloud è stato il modo migliore per fornire la semplicità che desideriamo. In questo modo, puoi creare la tua app nell'Editor Anvil e renderla live su Internet con un solo clic.<br/><br/>Ma continuavamo a sentire da persone che dicevano: "E' fantastico, ma..."<br/><br/>"...ma ho bisogno di eseguire questo su una piattaforma offshore senza accesso a Internet affidabile"<br/><br/>"...ma voglio imballare la mia app in un dispositivo IoT che vendo"<br/><br/>o semplicemente, "...ma se sto mettendo le mie uova in questo cestino, come posso essere sicuro di poter ancora eseguire la mia app tra dieci anni?"<br/><br/>Questi sono tutti buoni punti! Un servizio cloud non è la soluzione giusta per tutti. Se vogliamo servire questi utenti, deve esserci un modo per loro di ottenere le loro app da Anvil e gestirle localmente, sotto il loro completo controllo.<br/><br/>Open Source: Portello di fuga, non un sedile di espulsione<br/><br/>Nelle conferenze, a volte ci viene chiesto: "Posso esportarlo come app Flask+JS?". Certo, sarebbe possibile – potremmo generare un pacchetto server, compilare il client-side Python in Javascript, e sputare fuori una classica applicazione web. Ma avrebbe gravi inconvenienti, perché:<br/><br/>Non una corsa comoda.<br/><br/>Generazione di codice è un posto espulsore. Il codice generato è meglio di niente – almeno è possibile modificarlo! Ma nel momento in cui si modifica quel codice, si perdono tutti i vantaggi del sistema che lo ha generato. Se stai usando Anvil a causa del suo editor drag-and-drop e Python nel browser, perché i nostri utenti ospitati localmente dovrebbero utilizzare vim e Javascript?<br/><br/>Quindi l'abbiamo fatto nel modo giusto: abbiamo aperto il motore di runtime di Anvil. È lo stesso codice che serve la tua app nel nostro servizio ospitato e rappresenta la tua app allo stesso modo. È possibile modificare il codice con un editor di testo, eseguirlo, quindi git spingerlo indietro nel nostro IDE online. Non è un sedile di espulsione: non c'è transizione esplosiva. È un portello di fuga: si può salire fuori, e salire di nuovo.<br/><br/>E il nostro modello di business?<br/><br/>Anvil non è mai stato pensato per essere uno di quei sistemi low-code aziendali che ti addebitano $ 20 / mese per ogni persona che utilizza la tua app. Anvil è uno strumento di sviluppo. Le app che sviluppi sono tue. Consentire di eseguirli su un Raspberry Pi è bello, ma non cambia il nostro modello di business.<br/><br/>Stiamo facendo quello che siamo sempre stati: realizziamo e vendiamo uno strumento di sviluppo che rende drasticamente più semplice la creazione di applicazioni web. Forniamo hosting per le applicazioni Anvil. Offriamo l'intera piattaforma di sviluppo e hosting in loco per i clienti aziendali. E, naturalmente, offriamo un piano gratuito in modo che tutti possano utilizzare Anvil per hobby o scopi educativi - o per iniziare a costruire qualcosa e vedere come va.<br/><br/>Abbiamo open-source Anvil App Server per il (relativamente piccolo) numero di persone che ne hanno bisogno e per fornire la polizza assicurativa definitiva. Certo, puoi creare un'app con vim e ospitarla da solo, senza nemmeno registrare un account con noi (abbiamo documenti per mostrarti come!). Ma Anvil Editor è il modo più semplice al mondo per costruire un'app web, e il nostro servizio ospitato è il modo più semplice per distribuirlo - quindi questo è ciò che ci aspettiamo che la maggior parte dei nostri utenti continui a fare. E puoi costruire con fiducia, sapendo che il codice open source è proprio lì se ne hai bisogno.<br/><br/>Provate voi stessi<br/><br/>Se la nostra filosofia di sviluppo risuona con voi, perché non provare Anvil da soli? |
