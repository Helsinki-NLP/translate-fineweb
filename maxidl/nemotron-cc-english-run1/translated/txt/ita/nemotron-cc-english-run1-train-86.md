| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Lo storico quartiere di Leclaire, una volta indicato come "periferia a sud di Edwardsville", fu fondato come comunità cooperativa nel 1890 e rimase un villaggio separato fino all'annessione alla città di Edwardsville nel 1934. Giornali e riviste in tutti gli Stati Uniti e in Europa hanno riportato l'esperimento Leclaire, in particolare durante i primi 20 anni della sua esistenza. Nel 1979, a causa della sua storia unica, l'ex villaggio è stato elencato nel Registro Nazionale dei Luoghi Storici.<br/><br/>Leclaire è stata fondata da Nelson Oliver Nelson, un produttore di impianti idraulici di St. Louis che, per molti anni, ha cercato di far avanzare la situazione della classe operaia. Nelson voleva migliorare le condizioni di lavoro per i suoi dipendenti e fornire alloggi vicino alle fabbriche in modo che i lavoratori e le loro famiglie potessero facilmente partecipare ai programmi ricreativi ed educativi offerti gratuitamente dall'azienda. Prima del 1890, mentre era ancora a St. Louis, le attività di produzione e distribuzione della N. O. Nelson Company iniziarono a fornire una condivisione dei profitti insieme a opportunità educative e ricreative. L'esperimento cooperativo Leclaire porterebbe ulteriori benefici.<br/><br/>Quando i dipendenti di Nelson hanno indicato che volevano trasferirsi in una località rurale, i rappresentanti dell'azienda si sono avvicinati ai leader di piccole città in diverse comunità del Missouri e dell'Illinois vicino alla loro sede di St. Louis. Cercavano una proprietà adatta per costruire nuove fabbriche e un villaggio modello. A sud di Edwardsville trovarono un appezzamento di terreno di 125 acri con accesso ad acqua, carbone e trasporti. Gli imprenditori locali agirono rapidamente per offrire un incentivo finanziario. In meno di tre settimane, la comunità ha raccolto un fondo di $ 20.000 da contributi individuali tra $ 1 e $ 1.000 per invogliare Nelson a scegliere Edwardsville per la sua impresa.<br/><br/>I leader della città avevano sperato di localizzare la proprietà all'interno dei limiti della città di Edwardsville, ma quando non è stato possibile trovare un sito adatto, erano fiduciosi che l'investimento di Nelson a sud della città sarebbe presto diventato una parte di Edwardsville. Anche se Nelson ha soddisfatto tutte le contingenze per la costruzione e la creazione di posti di lavoro nel suo contratto, ci sarebbero voluti 44 anni prima dell'annessione a Edwardsville. Leclaire, delimitato da Madison / Brown Avenues a est, le ferrovie a ovest, Hadley / McKinley Avenues a sud e Wolf Street a nord, è rimasto un villaggio indipendente dal 1890 al 1934. Durante questo periodo si è guadagnato una reputazione per le innovazioni nel mondo degli affari, dell'istruzione e della pianificazione residenziale.<br/><br/>Il villaggio di Leclaire su una mappa del 1931 di Edwardsville<br/>Per gentile concessione di Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Alla fine degli anni ottanta del XIX secolo Nelson divenne un leader internazionale nei settori della cooperazione e della condivisione dei profitti, scambiando teorie sociali con altri in tutto il mondo e espandendo la sua attività a St. Louis. Chiamò il suo villaggio sperimentale in onore dell'attivista parigino Edme Jean Leclaire, ma visitò molti altri visionari sociali che fornirono informazioni e ispirazione. Compilando le migliori idee da questi esempi, Nelson fondò Leclaire per, nelle sue parole, "dare lavoro, promuovere l'intelligenza, fornire ricreazione, promuovere la bellezza e fare case". Più tardi gli scrittori hanno usato queste parole per formulare i principi fondanti di Leclaire: lavoro, case, educazione, ricreazione e bellezza, ma con l'ulteriore principio importante della libertà.<br/><br/>Lavoro<br/><br/>Il lavoro potrebbe essere considerato il più importante di questi fattori dal momento che senza i posti di lavoro in fabbrica a Leclaire, non ci sarebbe nessun villaggio. Gli edifici della fabbrica di mattoni sono stati progettati dall'architetto E. A. Cameron per fornire luce naturale, ventilazione in estate e pavimenti riscaldati in inverno. C'era un sistema di soppressione degli incendi e, anche se gli incidenti industriali non sono stati eliminati, ogni sforzo è stato fatto per garantire la sicurezza dei lavoratori. Gli edifici in mattoni ricoperti di edera erano circondati da prati ben curati e giardini fioriti che davano al complesso un aspetto simile a un campus. Nel 1894, la giornalista del New York World Nellie Bly ha definito gli edifici "la perfezione ideale degli edifici per l'uomo di lavorare in".<br/><br/>Il complesso manifatturiero della N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company a Leclaire<br/>Amici di Leclaire<br/><br/>Le politiche aziendali di Nelson sono state progettate per proteggere la stabilità finanziaria dei dipendenti. I lavoratori potrebbero guadagnare una parte dei profitti e avere una voce nell'azienda se scegliessero questa opzione. Il piano di condivisione dei profitti ha dato ai dipendenti Nelson un orgoglio di proprietà che si è tradotto in una forza lavoro solidale. Ci sono stati alcuni scioperi del lavoro di breve durata nel corso degli anni, ma per la maggior parte, i problemi di lavoro erano rari. I lavoratori avevano anche orari ragionevoli e salari competitivi. C'era un fondo di previdenza che prevedeva pensioni e congedi di malattia, nonché pensioni di vedova in caso di decesso di un lavoratore, indipendentemente dal fatto che il decesso fosse legato o meno al suo impiego.<br/><br/>La sede della N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) rimase a St. Louis, ma tutta la N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company fu trasferita a Leclaire. Nel 1900, i negozi divennero società indipendenti a fini fiscali, ma tutti erano ancora di proprietà della N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Gli abili artigiani che lavoravano qui ebbero anche contratti speciali, tra cui gabbie per bancomat per una banca locale e un altare ancora in uso nella Chiesa episcopale di Sant'Andrea a Edwardsville. Il Marble Shop si è specializzato in marmi architettonici che sono stati tagliati e installati dagli equipaggi di Nelson in case, aziende e persino capitali di stato in tutto il Midwest. Il negozio di macchine, che divenne Bignall e Keeler, realizzò macchine per il montaggio di tubi, pompe, calibri e vari strumenti meccanici attesi nel settore idraulico. Si diramarono anche per produrre articoli speciali come la bicicletta Leclaire a metà degli anni 1890. Il Brass Shop comprendeva una fonderia dove venivano fabbricati vari tubi e utensili idraulici. Questi esempi rappresentano solo alcuni dei lavori effettuati negli stabilimenti Leclaire. Il logo dell'azienda era un "NONCO" stilizzato che può ancora essere visto su apparecchi idraulici e alcuni idranti antincendio a Edwardsville oggi.<br/><br/>Abitazioni<br/><br/>Prima che le case potessero essere costruite, era necessario un alloggio per i lavoratori che stavano completando gli edifici della fabbrica e costruendo case. Per soddisfare queste esigenze, l'azienda costruì la "Club House", un grande edificio che serviva a molti scopi. Oltre all'alloggio, fu il primo edificio educativo della comunità e conteneva una biblioteca ben fornita.<br/><br/>La costruzione della parte residenziale di Leclaire iniziò subito dopo la fondazione del villaggio nel giugno del 1890. Julius Pitzman, l'innovativo architetto paesaggista che ha progettato i primi lotti a Leclaire, li ha allestiti con una serie di patti protettivi. I patti prevedevano strade ampie e curvilinee, grandi lotti e una restrizione di proprietà che limitava le proprietà solo a scopi residenziali o educativi. L'azienda ha pavimentato le strade, fornito lampioni elettrici, installato marciapiedi e piantato centinaia di alberi lungo le strade di Leclaire. Sezioni successive di Leclaire sono state disposte con un design a griglia convenzionale e lotti più piccoli, ma includevano ancora le restrizioni degli atti.<br/><br/>Un cottage vittoriano Leclaire nel 1907<br/>di Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inizialmente le case furono costruite dall'azienda e poi vendute a un costo vicino ai dipendenti di Nelson per incoraggiare la proprietà della casa. Se un lavoratore si ammalò e non poteva fare il suo mutuo, i pagamenti furono sospesi fino a quando non tornò al lavoro. Le case sono state offerte in una varietà di progetti di case e la società ha pubblicizzato che non c'erano due abitazioni uguali. Le prime case erano principalmente cottage vittoriani che venivano con elettricità e acqua corrente. I residenti potevano acquistare una casa costruita dall'azienda o acquistare un terreno vuoto e costruire una casa da soli, a condizione che il design architettonico rispettasse gli standard aziendali.<br/><br/>Negli ultimi anni, i lotti sono stati venduti agli investitori, di solito i residenti di Edwardsville, e molte case negli anni '20 sono state costruite da appaltatori locali che poi li hanno venduti ai residenti della zona.<br/><br/>Istruzione<br/><br/>Nelson credeva nell'educazione per tutti, compresa la classe operaia. La programmazione educativa iniziò con un asilo alla Club House nel 1892 e continuò nel nuovo edificio educativo al 722 Holyoake Road. Comunemente chiamato la "School House", questo edificio forniva una grande sala per riunioni e programmi, ma aveva partizioni mobili per dividerlo in spazio aula durante il giorno. La sera, c'erano balli, incontri o programmi del Leclaire Self-Culture Club che presentavano lezioni settimanali di professori della Washington University o oratori noti a livello nazionale che, come N. O. Nelson, facevano parte del movimento per il miglioramento sociale alla fine del secolo. Questi includevano Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, e l'autrice Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tra gli altri.<br/><br/>Bambini iscritti all'asilo Leclaire nel 1913<br/>di Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nei dieci anni successivi alla costruzione del 1895 dell'edificio educativo, ci furono una serie di esperimenti educativi tra cui una scuola industriale, un college, una scuola notturna e un'accademia. La prima e più longeva impresa fu la scuola materna mattutina, fondata nel 1892, che utilizzava il modello Fröbel. Questo programma di due anni era gratuito per tutti, compresi i bambini di Edwardsville, fino al 1931, quando per motivi finanziari l'azienda iniziò a pagare lezioni a studenti che non erano figli di dipendenti. Nelson Manufacturing gestiva un asilo fino al 1934, quando l'edificio fu consegnato al distretto scolastico di Edwardsville per una tassa nominale.<br/><br/>Ricreazione<br/><br/>Navigatori sul lago Leclaire nel 1915<br/>di Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>La ricreazione era una caratteristica importante di Leclaire. La società forniva strutture sportive per il baseball, il tennis e, in seguito, il calcio. Fu costruito un bowling e una sala da biliardo e c'era un lago per la nautica, il nuoto, la pesca o il pattinaggio su ghiaccio in inverno. Il parco Leclaire è stato arredato con barche, bagni maschili e femminili e un grande padiglione. I residenti organizzavano balli, hayrides, ortografia delle api e altre attività, e la compagnia sponsorizzava una band che suonava regolarmente ad intrattenimento nel villaggio o a Edwardsville. Come le funzioni educative della Club House e della School House, le strutture ricreative di Leclaire erano aperte a tutti e spesso erano una destinazione per i visitatori di Edwardsville e persino di St. Louis.<br/><br/>Bellezza<br/><br/>Prima fotografia del lago Leclaire<br/>di Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>L'ultimo dei fattori che Nelson ritenne importanti per una vita soddisfacente riguardava l'ambiente. Nelson sapeva dell'importanza di una vita sana. Apprezzò la bellezza e la pulizia che si potevano trovare nel paese, e incoraggiò tutti a Leclaire ad abbellire la loro proprietà piantando giardini e frutteti. Nelson stesso ha dato l'esempio, quindi una serra aziendale ha fornito fiori gratuiti e si sono tenuti concorsi per i cortili più belli. Leclaire è stato progettato in modo che l'intero villaggio avesse un ambiente simile a un parco ancora evidente oggi.<br/><br/>Libertà<br/><br/>Il negozio Cooperative Leclaire<br/>di Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson ha elencato cinque principi fondanti per Leclaire, ma gli scrittori moderni aggiungono un sesto: la libertà. Tutti i programmi offerti dalla società erano disponibili per i dipendenti così come per i residenti locali, ma nessuno era obbligatorio. La libertà di scegliere se partecipare o meno ai programmi aziendali dipendeva interamente dall'individuo. I residenti di Leclaire potevano lavorare per Nelson Manufacturing o altrove, e i lavoratori non erano obbligati a vivere a Leclaire. La partecipazione a programmi ricreativi ed educativi era anche facoltativa. C'era anche un negozio dell'azienda dove i dipendenti potevano fare acquisti, ma a differenza di altre città dell'azienda, nessuno era in debito con il negozio dell'azienda. Il Leclaire Store era una cooperativa in cui i membri venivano addebitati prezzi di mercato equi, ma venivano poi pagati dividendi trimestrali.<br/><br/>Una città diversa<br/><br/>Tutti questi vantaggi hanno reso Leclaire unico in altre città dell'azienda. Ma ci sono stati anche singoli casi in cui l'azienda ha mostrato compassione e cura per i dipendenti. La società chiuse le fabbriche e noleggiò treni escursionistici per portare i lavoratori e le loro famiglie a St. Louis per un giorno all'Esposizione Universale di St. Louis del 1904. Quando i soldi erano stretti, Nelson occasionalmente metteva denaro extra in ogni busta paga per rendere la vita più facile per i lavoratori, e se istituiva un programma con cui gli uomini non erano d'accordo, lo parlavano e, ogni volta che non lo faceva, Nelson si sarebbe capovolto.<br/><br/>Nato a Lillesand, in Norvegia, nel 1841, N. O. Nelson era un uomo complicato. Era un capitalista che credeva nella libera impresa, ma anche un socialista, un seguace della "Regola d'oro", e un patriota che ha servito per l'Unione nella guerra civile. Nel 1900, era un multimilionario, ma al momento della sua morte nel 1922, aveva dato tutto per il miglioramento della classe operaia.<br/><br/>Sebbene Leclaire non fosse l'unico esperimento sociale di Nelson, è considerato il suo sforzo di maggior successo. Altri importanti sforzi per il miglioramento sociale includevano una catena di negozi di alimentari cooperativi a New Orleans, un asilo nido per i figli dei dipendenti neri nel suo Bessemer, Alabama, fabbriche e una casa per i consumabili a Indio, California.<br/><br/>Il Villaggio di Leclaire di Nelson fu riconosciuto a livello internazionale come un esperimento degno di nota e di successo. È stato descritto nel New York World in numerose occasioni, ma in particolare dalla giornalista Nellie Bly nel 1894 che ha scritto a lungo sulla città modello in cui "La questione del lavoro è risolta e tutti felici in un piccolo villaggio vicino a St. Louis". Il Los Angeles Times ha anche regolarmente riferito su N. O. Nelson, così come il Chicago Daily Tribune e numerose altre pubblicazioni.<br/><br/>In un discorso alla celebrazione del quindicesimo anniversario di Leclaire nel 1915, Nelson disse: "Leclaire ti offre un'ospitalità ampia e aperta, e ti offre di goderti oggi la comodità, il comfort, la bellezza e l'ispirazione di cui godiamo ogni giorno". Più di un secolo è passato da quel giorno, ma l'invito è ancora valido. Residenti e ricercatori sono invitati a conoscere la storia di Leclaire e considerare le lezioni che potrebbero essere apprese per il miglioramento delle generazioni future.<br/><br/>Uno degli ex edifici del complesso manifatturiero nel 2019, che ora serve come N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autore Visite via Zoom o Skype<br/><br/>Sono entusiasta di visitare con i tuoi studenti via Zoom o Skype! Skype è un'ottima opzione per le scuole / classi che non portano autori di persona, ma che vogliono esplorare libri e poesie, connettersi con un autore e porre domande uno-a-uno.<br/><br/>Costo<br/><br/>Offro visite Zoom o Skype di 30-45 minuti con le scuole per $ 125 a sessione (o $ 200 per due sessioni che si svolgono entro tre ore al mattino o al pomeriggio; $ 325 per tre sessioni in un giorno; $ 425 per quattro sessioni in un giorno). In ogni sessione, cerco di coinvolgere i bambini nel modo più attivo possibile. No, non è lo stesso tipo di connessione che offre una visita di persona, ma può ancora essere stimolante e motivante per i bambini!<br/><br/>Cosa faccio<br/><br/>Ogni sessione per un massimo di 50 studenti include:<br/><br/>5 minuti di tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segmenti di 10ish-minuti ciascuno — È possibile scegliere tra:<br/><br/>Come sono diventato uno scrittore<br/><br/>Scrivere questo libro in particolare (si sceglie il libro su cui mi concentro)<br/><br/>Lettura (leggo alcune poesie e i bambini mi aiutano a leggere altre)<br/><br/>Presentazione in classe (i tuoi studenti hanno messo una lettura o una performance per me, un pubblico molto apprezzato!)<br/><br/>Scrivere una poesia insieme<br/><br/>Sessione di domande e risposte<br/><br/>5 minuti di wrap-up/addio<br/><br/>Chiacchiero anche con classi di insegnanti pre-servizio o gruppi di insegnanti in servizio su poesia e scrittura.<br/><br/>Suggerimenti per una grande visita virtuale<br/><br/>Suggerimenti per una visita virtuale di successo<br/><br/>Uno dei miei obiettivi per le visite scolastiche virtuali è catturare l'interattività che rende le visite di persona di successo e divertente. Ma la verità è che a volte è difficile essere virtualmente interattivi! Il timing potrebbe non sincronizzarsi correttamente, il che rende la lettura insieme una sfida, ed è davvero difficile per me ascoltare singoli studenti a meno che non vengano e parlino direttamente nel microfono / computer. Ma dopo qualche tentativo ed errore, ho scoperto alcuni modi per avere le migliori visite virtuali possibili. Eccoli: 10 modi per rendere la mia visita con i tuoi studenti una grande esperienza!<br/><br/>Prima della visita<br/><br/>Fai in modo che i bambini siano il più entusiasti possibile della visita. Visita il mio sito web con loro. Leggi alcuni dei miei libri con loro. Raccogli alcune domande che gli studenti hanno per me. Tutto ciò che fai in anticipo per farti sentire come un grande affare andrà un lungo cammino verso l'impegno degli studenti.<br/><br/>Posizionare la videocamera o il laptop con webcam in modo da poter vedere il più possibile il pubblico. È difficile valutare l'impegno degli studenti quando posso vedere solo un paio di studenti.<br/><br/>Limita ogni gruppo a 50 studenti. È incredibilmente difficile coinvolgere grandi gruppi tramite video.<br/><br/>Passerò rapidamente da un argomento all'altro o da una poesia a una poesia. Ricordate agli studenti che dovranno ascoltare attentamente per capire cosa sta succedendo.<br/><br/>Occasionalmente, faccio un po 'di Reader's Theater con gli studenti. Se ti invio parti di studenti con sceneggiatura in anticipo, stampa una copia per OGNI sessione e taglia a pezzi, se necessario.<br/><br/>Durante la visita<br/><br/>Quando parlo di un libro, se avete quel libro stampato, per favore tenetelo per gli studenti a vedere.<br/><br/>Tu sei il mio proxy. Spesso non posso chiamare gli studenti e sentire le risposte individuali. Quindi, potrei dire, "Otterremo 3 idee. Alza la mano se hai un'idea." Poi VOI prendete il comando, chiamate tre studenti, e annunciate quelle risposte a tutti nella stanza e a me.<br/><br/>Scegli gli studenti fiduciosi e in uscita per le parti dello studente con script (se ne invio uno in anticipo). Durante le mie visite scolastiche di persona, cerco di attirare alcuni degli studenti meno fiduciosi, ma ho scoperto che questo non funziona così bene durante le visite virtuali perché non riesco a sentirli.<br/><br/>Chiedi agli studenti di sedersi davanti e, quando è il momento, ricorda loro di parlare ad alta voce.<br/><br/>Nelle visite virtuali, la gestione del comportamento ricade esclusivamente su di te. Spesso non riesco a vedere esattamente cosa sta succedendo, quindi ti preghiamo di intervenire se necessario. Se c'è una grande interruzione, chiedimi solo di trattenermi per un momento in modo da non chiacchierare mentre nessuno sta prestando attenzione:>)<br/><br/>Sentitevi liberi di scattare foto di me sullo schermo e condividere sui social media, anche se le mie foto spesso sembrano ridicole perché sto facendo facce divertenti o qualcosa del genere mentre leggo!<br/><br/>Se avete domande, vi preghiamo di chiederle prima o durante la visita!<br/><br/>Programmare una sessione virtuale<br/><br/>Sei interessato a programmare una visita virtuale con me? Basta inviarmi un'email per fissare un appuntamento, e andremo da lì |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Archivio Notizie<br/><br/>Un nuovo libro esamina i modi in cui affrontare le sfide dell'HIV<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis con Marjorie Human che ha progettato la copertina del libro, Agire sull’HIV.<br/><br/>La pandemia dell’HIV ha messo in evidenza il meglio e il peggio degli esseri umani in termini di risposta. Da un lato ha provocato stigma e violenza e dall’altro ha portato a risposte costruttive e di sostegno da parte di vari individui e gruppi. Un nuovo libro, Agire sull’HIV, a cura del Prof. Dennis Francis, Decano della Facoltà di Educazione dell’Università dello Stato Libero, esamina come il dramma possa essere utilizzato per promuovere cambiamenti sociali vitali e cambiamenti comportamentali individuali.<br/><br/>Agire sull'HIV offre un'indagine sistematica sul dramma come approccio per discutere l'HIV / AIDS e atteggiamenti e comportamenti correlati. Il libro è un testo accademico e comprende il lavoro di una ventina di autori eccezionalmente creativi. Gli autori che hanno contribuito al libro includono, tra gli altri, il Prof. Hazel Barnes (Università del Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Università Stellenbosch) e Yvonne Sliep dell’Università del KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>“Questo progetto è iniziato nel 2009 e mi ha preso molto tempo per riunire il lavoro di autori eccezionalmente creativi. La ricerca che viene comunicata attraverso il libro è originale e tempestiva e dà un contributo significativo alle conversazioni sul ruolo e il significato del dramma nell'affrontare le questioni dell'HIV e dell'AIDS ", afferma il professor Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Dalla prima apparizione di Lara Croft in Tomb Raider (1996), le sue imprese come avventurosa e veloce esploratrice hanno risuonato ampiamente con i giocatori, guadagnandole un posto nel pantheon dei grandi personaggi della cultura pop. Per questo motivo metteremo The World of Lara Croft sotto i riflettori dal 22 dicembre 2021 al 6 marzo 2022.<br/><br/>Costruire un Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft è stata creata dallo studio Core Design, a Derby (Regno Unito), nel 1996. Lo studio era alla ricerca di un personaggio principale per il loro prossimo gioco di avventura 3D per PlayStation 1. Un gioco in una prospettiva in terza persona in cui i giocatori vedrebbero il personaggio principale in pieno in ogni scena.<br/><br/>Dato che il gioco si trattava di "radicare tombe misteriose in profondità sotto le piramidi", il personaggio principale avrebbe bisogno di apparire avventuroso e avere il cervello per sopravvivere a complesse missioni di raid. Dopo qualche deliberazione, nacque Lara Croft, una donna giovane, di classe alta e del tutto britannica, che era enigmatica e intelligente quanto era dura e autosufficiente.<br/><br/>Successo e polemiche<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) è stato un successo fulminante per Core Design, che ha rapidamente raddoppiato la costruzione di Tomb Raider 2 (1997) e 3 (1998). Gran parte del successo è stato attribuito alla protagonista dei giochi, che ha trovato ammiratori sia con giocatori maschili che femminili. Questo ha sconcertato i critici che hanno appena visto Lara Croft come un cartone sessista.<br/><br/>Esplora il mondo di Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>Questa mostra esplora il franchise di successo in profondità. Si esamina la storia dei giochi e perché la sua protagonista risuona con così tante persone. Si tuffa anche nel mistero di ciò che rende i giochi di Tomb Raider, dalla costruzione del mondo profondo agli enigmi e trappole intelligenti, e dai fantastici disegni nemici e mostri al design del personaggio della leggendaria eroina.<br/><br/>Dopo tutto, i misteri sono lì per esplorare, e lo sono stati per gli ultimi 25 anni.<br/><br/>Biglietti<br/><br/>Acquista i tuoi biglietti per Storyworld online con data di inizio e orario di ingresso da mercoledì 22 dicembre.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Immobiliare Parola del giorno: Opzione<br/><br/>Opzione: Un accordo per mantenere aperta, per un periodo prestabilito, un'offerta per vendere o affittare immobili. Un'opzione può essere utilizzata, ad esempio, per dare all'acquirente il tempo di risolvere le questioni di finanziamento, titolo, zonizzazione e fattibilità prima di impegnare l'acquirente all'acquisto. Le opzioni sono spesso utilizzate nel processo di assemblaggio del terreno. L'opzione deve essere supportata dalla sua effettiva considerazione, separata e indipendente dal prezzo di acquisto della proprietà. Il mero considerando di controprestazione da solo non è sufficiente se non in un'opzione di locazione in cui le disposizioni del contratto di locazione sono di per sé sufficienti per sostenere l'opzione. Un'opzione crea semplicemente un diritto contrattuale; non dà al beneficiario dell'opzione alcuna proprietà nella proprietà. Al momento della firma dell'opzione, il proprietario non vende, né l'acquirente acquista, la proprietà. Anche se il proprietario è obbligato a vendere se dato preavviso dall'acquirente, l'acquirente non è obbligato ad acquistare. Un'opzione di acquisto è anche conosciuta come una chiamata; un'opzione di vendita è conosciuta come un put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Benefici dei carotenoidi per la pelle<br/><br/>Avete mai sentito parlare di carotenoidi? Questi potenti fitochimici sono i costituenti pigmentati che si trovano nelle piante che danno fiori, frutti e lasciano i loro colori giallo, arancione e rosso.<br/><br/>Dal 1930, gli scienziati hanno identificato circa 800 carotenoidi e circa 40 si trovano nel corpo umano, tra cui lo strato più esterno dell'epidermide, il derma e il grasso sottocutaneo. I carotenoidi più comuni sono beta-carotene, alfa-carotene, luteina, zeaxantina, licopene e astaxantina. Puoi leggere di più sull'astaxantina qui.<br/><br/>Il contenuto di carotenoidi nella pelle è influenzato da numerosi fattori, tra cui l'assunzione di frutta e verdura, la loro biodisponibilità da vari alimenti, l'integrazione, l'esposizione ai raggi UV, l'inquinamento atmosferico, il consumo di alcol, il fumo e lo stress.<br/><br/>In che modo i carotenoidi aiutano la mia pelle?<br/><br/>I carotenoidi sono alcuni degli antiossidanti più noti per la pelle e hanno anche importanti funzioni come agenti antinfiammatori.<br/><br/>Invecchiamento sano e riparazione della pelle<br/><br/>Gli antiossidanti sono essenziali per una pelle sana perché aiutano a prevenire i danni dei radicali liberi alle cellule. I danni dei radicali liberi causano l'invecchiamento precoce e l'insorgenza di vari tipi di tumori della pelle. I carotenoidi, insieme alla vitamina E, alla vitamina C e all'enzima Co Q10 sono importanti antiossidanti cutanei.<br/><br/>Grazie alla loro attività antiossidante, i carotenoidi supportano e incoraggiano la produzione di collagene ed elastina nella pelle. Questo aiuta ad aumentare la densità, lo spessore, l'elasticità e la compattezza della pelle. Collagene ed elastina diminuiscono con l’età, quindi assumere abbastanza carotenoidi nella dieta e localmente è fondamentale per invecchiare bene.<br/><br/>I carotenoidi possono migliorare i segni di fotoinvecchiamento, scolorimento della pelle, elasticità, idratazione, consistenza e possono ridurre la perdita di acqua transepidermica.<br/><br/>L'astaxantina in particolare stimola i fibroblasti a produrre collagene ed elastina, inibisce l'attività degli enzimi che scompongono collagene ed elastina e mostra effetti antinfiammatori e filtranti UV. È stato dimostrato che riduce la melanina nella pelle, che si traduce nella diminuzione della comparsa di lentiggini e melasma.<br/><br/>Attività anti-acne: l'attività anti-infiammatoria dei carotenoidi aiuta a smorzare l'infiammazione e l'irritazione associata all'acne. I carotenoidi aiutano anche a normalizzare e bilanciare le secrezioni di olio dalle ghiandole sebacee. Sono agenti preziosi nella riparazione della pelle e stimolano la rigenerazione epidermica, aiutando a levigare e ammorbidire la pelle.<br/><br/>Dove posso trovare i carotenoidi?<br/><br/>Ci sono due modi per ottenere la dose giornaliera di carotenoidi: attraverso la dieta e attraverso l'applicazione topica. La combinazione di entrambi è l'approccio ideale per la cura della pelle di invecchiamento.<br/><br/>I carotenoidi sono liposolubili, quindi il tuo corpo ha bisogno di grassi per assorbirli (pensa a pomodori e olio d'oliva, broccoli e burro, o spinaci e avocado). Fonti comuni di carotenoidi negli alimenti sono avocado, tuorli d’uovo, cavolo, spinaci, carote, patate dolci, papaia e pomodori.<br/><br/>Mentre sosteniamo di ottenere il maggior numero possibile di nutrienti e antiossidanti dal cibo piuttosto che dall'integrazione, uno studio ha dimostrato che l'astaxantina combinata con l'idrolizzato di collagene ha migliorato significativamente l'integrità della barriera, ha ridotto la perdita di acqua transepidermica e ha aumentato l'espressione del mRNA del procollagene di tipo I.<br/><br/>L'applicazione topica è la chiave per una pelle sana. Gli studi dimostrano che le alte concentrazioni di antiossidanti nella pelle umana offrono la migliore protezione per una pelle sana a qualsiasi età.<br/><br/>In Sarka Botanicals misceliamo piante intere ricche di carotenoidi come la calendula, il dente di leone ed estratti come l'astaxantina con oli pressati a freddo e ingredienti funzionali. Gli studi dimostrano che i carotenoidi miscelati con il coenzima Q10 sono particolarmente efficaci nel ridurre l'infiammazione e rallentare l'invecchiamento precoce della pelle a causa dell'esposizione al sole. |
