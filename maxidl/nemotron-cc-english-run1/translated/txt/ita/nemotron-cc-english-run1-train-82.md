In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blog di certificazione CPR online<br/><br/>Data: 23 luglio 2014<br/><br/>La malattia renale interstiziale autosomica dominante è una rara collezione di malattie che interessano le funzioni conosciute del rene. In termini semplici, la condizione è caratterizzata da: si sviluppa una malattia renale e subisce un trapianto di rene e altre malattie associate alla concentrazione acida nel sangue e nella gotta. In teoria, la condizione si verificherà anche se il cambiamento genetico è ereditato da un genitore e si verifica sporadicamente quando non c'è storia familiare.<br/><br/>Nomi comuni di malattia renale interstiziale autosomica dominante<br/><br/>La condizione ha anche altri nomi, vale a dire: malattia renale cistica midollare, anche se questo nome non è usato tanto perché la maggior parte delle persone che soffrono di questa condizione non hanno cisti midollare. È anche indicato come nefropatia iperuricemica giovanile. La malattia tende a colpire le persone di età compresa tra 20 e 50 anni. Quest'ultima condizione come menzionato si verifica nei bambini piccoli, qualcosa che si traduce in ottenere da entrambi i genitori.<br/>La malattia renale cistica è una condizione ereditaria in cui le cisti al centro di ciascun rene perdono gradualmente la loro capacità di funzionare correttamente. Le cisti si riferiscono a vesciche anormali di liquido nel rene. La condizione spaventa ulteriormente il rene rendendo incapace di concentrare l'urina e di conseguenza, producendo troppa urina. I suoi sintomi includono minzione eccessiva, voglie di sale, debolezza, confusione, sanguinamento, affaticamento, singhiozzo frequente, bassa pressione sanguigna, nausea e vomito, mal di testa, pelle pallida, sensazione ridotta nelle mani, perdita di peso tra molti altri. Altre complicazioni includono: anemia, ulcere, perdita di densità ossea, infertilità e altri problemi legati al cuore.<br/>La sua analisi comprende esami del sangue per verificare i livelli di sodio e le funzioni renali generali, esami delle urine per verificare i livelli di concentrazione e altri squilibri, raggi X per verificare la dimensione dei reni che possono essere alterati a causa di concentrazioni urinarie aumentate, biopsia renale e test genetici per verificare eventuali cambiamenti genetici che potrebbero aver avuto luogo in tempo.<br/>Mentre la malattia non ha un taglio e trattamento a secco ad esso, si può concentrare su misure di controllo, che includono l'assunzione di liquidi e sale per integrare quello perso come la malattia progredisce nelle ultime fasi. Questo aiuta anche a ridurre la disidratazione. Altri trattamenti includono l'assunzione di farmaci prescritti e cambiamenti nella dieta e assunzioni minime di alimenti contenenti fosforo e potassio. Ulteriori complicazioni possono anche richiedere un trapianto di rene. Fondamentalmente, questa non è una malattia curabile, ma piuttosto una malattia gestibile una volta rilevata nelle fasi iniziali.<br/><br/>Il fattore comune ma diverso della malattia renale interstiziale autosomica dominante<br/><br/>La nefronoftisi e la malattia renale cistica midollare sono principalmente raggruppate perché, in sostanza, condividono le stesse caratteristiche, ma con una leggera differenza nei modelli ereditari rispetto ai primi che colpiscono i bambini e ai secondi che colpiscono i giovani adulti e le fasce di età più anziane. Caratteristiche simili per entrambi sono la concentrazione di urina ADH resistente che porta a poliuria e polidipsia, anemia e malattie renali.<br/>La prima condizione di cui sopra è autosomica recessiva che rappresenta il 15% delle malattie croniche e causa ESRD durante la prima infanzia, mentre la seconda è autosomica dominante con alcune nuove mutazioni sporadiche e causa ESRD per le persone di età compresa tra 30 e 50 anni. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Il racconto di Hobbes vs. Locke sullo stato di natura<br/><br/>Argomento: FilosofiaParole: 2539Pagine: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes e Locke sono tra i filosofi politici più influenti che abbiano mai scritto in inglese. Lo stato di natura, che precede l'organizzazione delle società complesse, è la premessa comune che sia Hobbes che Locke condividono ma interpretano in modi diversi. Il primo vede gli esseri umani nel loro stato naturale come ugualmente pericolosi e liberi di perseguire i loro obiettivi egoistici senza restrizioni dalle nozioni inesistenti di giustizia, motivo per cui il suo stato naturale equivale alla "guerra di ogni uomo contro ogni uomo" (Hobbes 76). Quest'ultimo, d'altra parte, considera gli esseri umani nella loro condizione originale come ugualmente preziosi e limita la libertà naturale con l'idea di giustizia che richiede di non nuocere agli altri, che consente di definire lo stato di natura come "assistenza reciproca e conservazione" piuttosto che la guerra (Locke 15). La differenza chiave tra i due resoconti filosofici dello stato naturale è che Locke utilizza considerazioni etiche mentre Hobbes non lo fa, e alla fine porta Hobbes a prevedere uno stato che esercita un potere illimitato sugli esseri umani, mentre Locke limita il governo dai principi morali, che considera una legge naturale.<br/><br/>Hobbes basa le sue ipotesi sullo stato di natura sul fatto che tutte le persone sono approssimativamente uguali nelle loro capacità fisiche e mentali. Egli ammette che alcuni individui possono dimostrare una maggiore forza fisica o un intelletto superiore, ma insiste che "quando tutto è calcolato insieme, la differenza tra l'uomo e l'uomo non è così considerevole" (Hobbes 74). Poiché gli esseri umani sono approssimativamente uguali nelle loro capacità, hanno anche speranze simili di raggiungere i loro scopi e soddisfare i loro bisogni (Hobbes 75). Come risultato logico di questa uguaglianza, quando le persone iniziano a competere per risorse scarse, nessuno può sentirsi completamente sicuro nei suoi possedimenti. Anche se una persona potente, astuta e capace riesce a soggiogare "le persone di tutti gli uomini che può", non garantisce ancora la sicurezza ultima (Hobbes 75). Poiché nessun essere umano può ottenere una tale superiorità sugli altri che lo rende completamente immune alla loro forza d’intelletto, nessun essere umano può sentirsi completamente al sicuro quando è circondato dai suoi pari. L'uguaglianza di Hobbes nello stato naturale è l'uguaglianza della paura, dove tutti gli esseri umani si vedono come pericolosi concorrenti.<br/><br/>Proprio come Hobbes, Locke considera tutti gli esseri umani fondamentalmente uguali, ma attribuisce un significato molto diverso al termine. Dal suo punto di vista, non è l'uguaglianza delle capacità, ma, piuttosto, l'uguaglianza del valore. Egli ritiene che le persone "promiscuamente nate con tutti gli stessi vantaggi della natura" dovrebbero logicamente godere della perfetta uguaglianza tra di loro, poiché non c'è motivo di considerare nessuno intrinsecamente più prezioso (Locke 8). L'unico fondamento possibile per designare alcune persone come superiori ad altre sarebbe se Dio "per qualsiasi manifesta dichiarazione della sua volontà, pone uno sopra l'altro" (Locke 8). Poiché tale sanzione divina di superiorità è assente, Locke conclude che l'uguaglianza naturale di tutti i rappresentanti dell'umanità non deve essere messa in discussione. Hobbes si avvicina pragmaticamente all'uguaglianza e sottolinea che le persone nel loro stato naturale sono ugualmente pericolose, ma Locke impiega un approccio etico e sottolinea che gli esseri umani sono ugualmente preziosi agli occhi di Dio. Questo disaccordo è solo la prima differenza tra i due autori basata sul fatto che Locke include Dio come premessa nella sua filosofia politica, mentre Hobbes non lo fa.<br/><br/>Un'altra caratteristica del racconto di Hobbes dello stato naturale è la sua interpretazione della libertà. Secondo Hobbes, lo stato di natura implica la libertà illimitata di fare tutto ciò che è necessario per la propria esistenza continua. Il filosofo definisce la libertà come "l'assenza di impedimenti esterni" nell'uso delle proprie capacità per raggiungere i propri obiettivi (Hobbes 79). Lo scopo primario di ogni essere senziente è quello di mantenere la sua esistenza continua. Di conseguenza, la libertà hobbesiana equivale all'opportunità senza ostacoli di fare qualsiasi cosa che, a suo giudizio, sarebbe più adatta a preservare la propria vita e i propri beni (Hobbes 79). L'unico limite alla libertà è che una persona non può fare nulla di contraddittorio per sostenere la sua vita o distruggere "i mezzi per preservarla" (Hobbes 79). A parte questo, non ci sono confini, e ognuno ha "il diritto a tutto, anche al corpo dell'altro" se ciò favorisce la propria sopravvivenza (Hobbes 80). Così, la libertà naturale, come vista da Hobbes, è l'assenza di ostacoli forzati dall'esterno nel perseguire il proprio diritto a tutto per sostenere e garantire la propria esistenza continua.<br/><br/>Locke sostiene anche l'idea della libertà naturale, ma, senza sorpresa, la affronta in un modo significativamente diverso da quello di Hobbes. Non appena inizia a discutere della libertà nello stato di natura, nota immediatamente che uno stato di libertà non equivale a "uno stato di licenza" (Locke 9). Il filosofo identifica due limitazioni specifiche alla libertà umana nello stato di natura. Il primo è identico a quello introdotto da Hobbes: per quanto libero e indipendente, una persona nondimeno "non ha la libertà di distruggere se stessa" (Locke 9), tuttavia il secondo limite contraddice direttamente le preposizioni di Hobbes. Secondo Locke, ogni essere umano ha l'obbligo naturale di non "danneggiare un altro nella sua vita, salute, libertà o possedimenti" (9). Proprio come con la sua interpretazione dell'uguaglianza, l'autore basa questa affermazione su motivi etici e religiosi: le persone dovrebbero preservare l'esistenza dell'altro poiché sono tutte creazioni dello stesso "onnipotente e infinitamente saggio creatore" (Locke 9). Così, Locke limita la libertà nello stato naturale molto più rigorosamente di Hobbes introducendo l'obbligo di astenersi dal danneggiare se stessi e gli altri.<br/><br/>Le differenze tra i due autori si manifestano anche nei loro resoconti della giustizia nello stato naturale dell'umanità. Per quanto riguarda Hobbes, delineare pratiche giuste e ingiuste è solo questione di legge. Non c'è giurisprudenza nello stato di natura, e l'unica legge che governa gli esseri umani nella loro condizione originale è una legge naturale che li obbliga solo a cercare la sicurezza personale. Di conseguenza, nulla può essere ingiusto nello stato originale dell'umanità: "le nozioni di giustizia e ingiustizia giusta e sbagliata" non hanno posto e significato in assenza della legge rigorosamente applicata (Hobbes 78). Finché le persone usano la loro libertà praticamente illimitata per competere spietatamente tra loro per le risorse, alle quali hanno ugualmente diritto, non hanno criteri per distinguere tra azioni giuste e ingiuste. Pertanto, lo stato di natura hobbesiano sfida l’idea stessa di giustizia, poiché l’autore la interpreta come una mera funzione della legge formalizzata e stabilita.<br/><br/>Locke attribuisce un significato diverso alla giustizia e la vede non tanto in termini legislativi quanto in termini etici. Questo articolo ha già menzionato che, a differenza di Hobbes, Locke impiega nozioni etiche e generalmente basa la sua filosofia politica su presunzioni morali piuttosto che puramente pratiche. La legge naturale di Locke, a differenza di quella di Hobbes, obbliga gli esseri umani a prendersi cura l'uno dell'altro piuttosto che semplicemente lasciare che tutti si difendano da soli. Di conseguenza, c'è un posto per la giustizia e l'ingiustizia nel suo stato di natura. L'autore stesso sottolinea questo fatto quando osserva che nessuno dovrebbe privare un altro della sua vita dei mezzi per preservarla "a meno che non sia per rendere giustizia a un trasgressore" (Locke 9). Questa affermazione rivela con la massima chiarezza che, secondo Locke, c’è giustizia nello stato di natura, e, inoltre, gli esseri umani devono preservarla attivamente. Il criterio della giustizia, che manca allo stato naturale di Hobbes, è la seconda limitazione alla libertà naturale imposta da Locke: un'azione è ingiusta se costituisce una minaccia ingiustificata alla vita e ai beni di un'altra persona.<br/><br/>Queste differenze nel trattamento dei due autori di uguaglianza, libertà e giustizia o ingiustizia culminano nella loro interpretazione del rapporto tra lo stato di natura e lo stato di guerra. Dal punto di vista di Hobbes, i due sono sinonimi, perché la concorrenza spietata è l'unico risultato logico di mettere le persone con capacità equivalenti e bisogni simili in un ambiente con risorse limitate. Egli afferma questa connessione apertamente: "se due uomini desiderano la stessa cosa, che tuttavia non possono entrambi godere, diventano nemici" e sono, quindi, in stato di guerra l'uno con l'altro (Hobbes 75). Tuttavia, poiché gli esseri umani sono numerosi e tutti possiedono capacità e bisogni simili, questa competizione si manifesta non solo nelle interazioni individuali, ma anche a livello di umanità nel suo complesso. Finché tutti gli uomini hanno diritti uguali e illimitati su tutte le risorse e persino sui corpi e sulle vite degli altri, lo stato di natura è una guerra di "ogni uomo contro ogni uomo" (Hobbes 76). Questa cupa interpretazione deriva direttamente dal ritratto di Hobbes dello stato di natura governato esclusivamente dagli impulsi egoistici degli individui.<br/><br/>Locke, d’altra parte, distingue tra lo stato di natura e lo stato di guerra e sottolinea che, sebbene possano verificarsi simultaneamente, non è motivo di identificarsi l’uno con l’altro. La definizione di Locke dello stato di guerra è praticamente identica a quella offerta da Hobbes. Secondo Locke, "chi tenta di mettere un altro uomo nel suo potere assoluto si mette così in uno stato di guerra con lui" (14). Questa spiegazione si allinea perfettamente con l'idea hobbesiana che il diritto universale di tutti a tutto, compresi i corpi e le vite degli altri, porta allo stato di guerra. Eppure Locke rifiuta di equiparare lo stato di guerra e lo stato di natura proprio perché nega l'interpretazione di Hobbes della libertà naturale. Poiché lo stato naturale di Locke impedisce alle persone di danneggiarsi a vicenda attraverso la seconda limitazione della libertà, un attentato alla libertà di un'altra persona è una trasgressione della legge naturale. Mentre per Hobbes, la guerra è la condizione dell'umanità per impostazione predefinita, Locke la ritrae come una perversione dello stato di natura piuttosto che del suo dominio.<br/><br/>Queste differenze nel delineare lo stato sulla natura e sui suoi costituenti, come la libertà, l'uguaglianza, la giustizia e la guerra, aprono la strada agli autori che contraddicono ritratti di governo. Sulla base della sua valutazione pessimistica dello stato di natura, l'autore del Leviatano conclude che, in condizioni di guerra, non può esserci alcuna speranza definitiva di "vivere il tempo che la natura ordinariamente permette agli uomini di vivere" (Hobbes 80). La soluzione è quella di stabilire il diritto universale a tutto e lasciare a tutti "tanto libertà contro gli altri uomini, quanto egli permetterebbe ad altri uomini contro se stesso" (Hobbes 80). I partecipanti al contratto sociale risultante investono le libertà illimitate che hanno ceduto in un sovrano – il portatore del potere supremo il cui scopo è quello di preservare lo status quo raggiunto punindo tutte le trasgressioni contro di esso. Il potere del sovrano è assoluto: il sovrano ha l'autorità di "fare tutto ciò che riterrà necessario" per promuovere la pace tra i suoi sudditi in modo che nessuno possa assaltare la vita o la proprietà di un altro (113). Hobbes conclude che senza una tale figura inattaccabile con il diritto di fare qualsiasi cosa ai soggetti, non ci può essere pace e nessuna garanzia di sicurezza.<br/><br/>Mentre Locke è d'accordo con la necessità di creare società politicamente organizzate, si oppone tuttavia all'idea di Hobbes del potere sovrano come illimitato e inattaccabile. Come accennato in precedenza, lo stato di natura di Locke non è così terribile come quello dipinto da Hobbes a causa dell'obbligo del popolo di preservare non solo se stessi ma anche l'un l'altro. Pertanto, la necessità del contratto sociale non nasce dalla paura degli altri, ma dalla semplice convenienza. Le piccole comunità potrebbero non aver bisogno di numerose leggi per risolvere i conflitti e "ufficiali per sorvegliare il processo", ma le associazioni più grandi ritengono consigliabile istituire governi per questo scopo (Locke 57). Tuttavia, il potere del governo non può essere illimitato, perché si tradurrebbe nel sottomettere i sudditi a una "volontà incostante, incerta, sconosciuta, arbitraria di un altro uomo" (Locke 17). Accettando il potere assoluto di un'altra persona sulla sua vita, un soggetto violerebbe la sua prima limitazione vietando di danneggiare se stesso. Per quanto riguarda il sovrano, distruggere la libertà di un'altra persona costituirebbe un danno diretto e, come tale, sarebbe in contraddizione con la seconda limitazione.<br/><br/>Come continuazione diretta della sua causa per l'autorità governativa illimitata, Hobbes nega la separazione dei poteri come principio. Dal suo punto di vista, il sovrano, una volta istituito, possiede "tutto il potere di prescrivere le regole" che governano la vita dei sudditi o, in termini più brevi, il potere legislativo (Hobbes 114). Il sovrano si riserva anche il diritto di "ascoltare e decidere tutte le controversie" - cioè il potere giudiziario (Hobbes 114). Infine, poiché l’intero scopo del sovrano è quello di costringere i sudditi ad astenersi dal nuocere l’un l’altro, non c’è dubbio che il potere esecutivo è anche la sua prerogativa esclusiva. La separazione dei poteri come concetto è estranea a Hobbes a causa delle sue opinioni sullo stato della natura. Creare un’entità politica in cui i rami esecutivo, legislativo e giudiziario si verifichino a vicenda – cioè competono – significherebbe ricreare lo stato Hobbesiano della natura-come-guerra ad un livello superiore. Dal momento che le persone stipulano un contratto sociale e istituiscono un governo per mettere lo stato di natura dietro di loro, non per ripristinarlo in una forma diversa, la separazione dei poteri è direttamente contraddittoria con le opinioni di Hobbes.<br/><br/>Locke, d'altra parte, abbraccia la separazione del potere come principio fondante della sua teoria politica. Il suo caso per la separazione è evidente nella discussione dei limiti del potere legislativo. Come dice Locke, sarebbe difficilmente consigliabile "che le stesse persone, che hanno il potere di fare leggi, abbiano anche nelle loro mani il potere di eseguirle" (76). Il filosofo indica le imperfezioni della natura umana e il desiderio intrinseco di "afferrare il potere" come una logica per questa misura precauzionale (Locke 76). Proprio come nel caso di Hobbes, il racconto di Locke sulla separazione dei poteri deriva direttamente dalla sua interpretazione dello stato di natura. Se c'è già giustizia nello stato di natura e il popolo può capirla, qualsiasi governo è inevitabilmente soggetto alla stessa legge naturale. Poiché il potere assoluto sulle persone viola entrambe le limitazioni di questa legge, è consigliabile separarlo e distribuirlo in modo che il governo funzioni in modo appropriato.<br/><br/>Questo articolo ha dimostrato che, mentre le differenze tra i resoconti di Hobbes e Locke sullo stato naturale dell'umanità sono numerose, alla fine ammontano alla presenza di assenza di premesse morali. Hobbes vede lo stato naturale come quello della libertà illimitata, dove le persone dotate di uguali capacità e non vincolate da alcuna nozione morale, come la giustizia, competono incessantemente per le risorse. Locke, tuttavia, interpreta l'uguaglianza e la libertà eticamente piuttosto che praticamente e ritiene che la guerra sia una perversione dello stato naturale, poiché la legge naturale obbliga gli esseri umani a non danneggiarsi a vicenda. Hobbes insiste su un sovrano onnipotente, poiché, in assenza di restrizioni etiche, nessun'altra autorità potrebbe costringere gli esseri umani ad astenersi dal danneggiarsi a vicenda. Eppure, secondo Locke, concedere al governo poteri illimitati sarebbe in contraddizione con le limitazioni etiche incorporate nella legge della natura, motivo per cui lui, a differenza di Hobbes, sostiene la separazione dei poteri. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: cosa ha vomitato Game of Thrones<br/><br/>Il cantante canadese-francese Abbas Hasan ha fatto uno sforzo accecante per superare tutta l'umanità alla Fashion Parade 2014. Non c'è niente di sbagliato in questo, tranne che la sicurezza è una priorità e il musicista è un pericolo per la salute qui.<br/><br/>Sappiamo che vuole essere una star. Purtroppo, non ha ricevuto il memo in cui dicono ai disperati e agli infami che la star è una metafora. Non devi sembrare uno e letteralmente incendiare la nostra vista. Inoltre, l'All Pakistan Aunty Association ha presentato ufficialmente una denuncia contro di lui. Il mercato locale è asciutto di falsi cristalli e mostruosità a paillettes. Non hanno nulla da indossare ai loro tè alti bi-settimanali e sostengono che sia lui il colpevole. A quanto pare, l'outfit è ispirato a Game of Thrones. Può per favore attenersi a comporre canzoni tristi sul cane morto del suo vicino invece di concettualizzare gli outfit? O forse è il trauma di perdere il cane, la cui morte non è chiaramente finita mentre indossa ancora la sua carcassa.<br/><br/>Il foglio di carica Outfit<br/><br/>Nessuno può decidere dove inizia l’outfit e dove finisce Abbas. Si guarda con fascino, affondando in un profondo abisso e chiedendosi perché indossa pantaloni di pelle. Chi cavallo ha ucciso per rubare la sella drappeggiata sulle spalle? Era in prigione proprio prima del suo aspetto sul tappeto rosso e ha dimenticato di togliersi le catene? Come sopravviverà all'eruzione cutanea sintetica e post-paillettes che è destinata ad essere letale in dosi così elevate? Perché sono ancora vivo?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>La sua ispirazione era apparentemente Game of Thrones, ma alla fine finì per sembrare come se fosse stato buttato fuori da un ristorante vichingo. Se avesse incontrato uno dei personaggi dello show, sarebbe stato ucciso nei primi cinque secondi del primo episodio.<br/><br/>La salute mentale o la mancanza di esso: Qualcuno lo porta a un consulente ASAP! Sembra essere sotto l'ipotesi che indossare un cane morto significa che l'unico amico che aveva nella sua vita è ancora vivo. Caro Abbas:<br/><br/>1. La negazione non è un fiume in Egitto<br/><br/>2. La tua psiche torturata non sta aiutando la tua musica, quindi ottieni aiuto<br/><br/>3. Prova amici immaginari<br/><br/>Salvataggio!<br/><br/>Tutti noi al quartier generale della polizia di moda siamo gravemente traumatizzati. Abbas è qualcuno che non ci è piaciuto arrestare. Attualmente è in custodia e sta cercando vendetta indossando abiti di altri spettacoli fantasy. Come messaggio di servizio pubblico e per prevenire ulteriori crisi nervose, gli abbiamo dato i seguenti esempi di uomini dal tappeto rosso dello stesso evento.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>In caso di dubbio, gioca al sicuro. Il cantante sembra tuo zio medio in uno shaadi. Un vestito nero semplice senza accessori, anche se è un po 'sproporzionato, è fattibile. L'aspetto di Zohaib si fonde in tutto e niente, e quando non hai un senso della moda o i soldi per assumere uno stilista, questo va bene. Non comporta il rischio di arresto cardiaco per i compagni partecipanti a un evento. Data la delicata condizione mentale di Abbas, questo look è quello a cui dovrebbe puntare. Sempre e per sempre.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Un giorno, dopo decenni di terapia, Abbas potrebbe aspirare a indossare abiti come quelli di Ali Zafar. Ali si è avvicinato molto a sembrare un maître d in un ristorante francese con la sua giacca bianca estiva con risvolti neri, ma la camicia lo salva, non importa il raso. I suoi pantaloni sarebbero stati ridicoli se non fossero stati piegati alle caviglie. Le scarpe sono ciò che hipster chic happy endings sono fatti di. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Determinazione delle proprietà idrauliche del suolo con diversi liquidi umidificanti: una tesi presentata in adempimento parziale dei requisiti per il Master of Science presso la Lincoln University<br/><br/>Astratto<br/><br/>Le proprietà idrauliche del suolo, come la conduttività idraulica, la ritenzione idrica e le relazioni con l'acqua delle piante, dominano i processi di movimento dell'acqua, ad esempio l'infiltrazione, l'evaporazione e il flusso d'acqua all'interno del suolo. Come fenomeno diffuso nel suolo, la idrorepellenza del suolo altera le funzioni idrauliche del suolo resistendo al flusso d'acqua nel suolo. Inoltre, le proprietà idrauliche non solo dipendono dal sistema dei pori del suolo, ma sono anche influenzate dalle proprietà fisico-chimiche delle superfici dei pori. Rispetto all'acqua, l'etanolo non è influenzato dalla idrorepellenza a causa della sua minore tensione superficiale. Lo scopo dell'uso di etanolo è quello di eliminare l'effetto della idrorepellenza del suolo sulle misure delle proprietà idrauliche. Tuttavia, l'applicazione di etanolo puro nel suolo naturale può degradare i materiali organici del suolo e portare a cambiamenti nelle proprietà fisiche. Pertanto, le soluzioni acquose di etanolo possono essere un'opzione alternativa. Tuttavia, la fattibilità dell'uso di etanolo acquoso per determinare la curva di ritenzione di liquidi del suolo rimane sconosciuta. Questo studio ha lo scopo di testare la fattibilità delle soluzioni acquose di etanolo (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % e 100 % v/v) per stabilire la curva di ritenzione di liquidi sotto una piccola gamma di pressione applicata in campioni di sabbia grossolana con diversa umidità e terreno naturale organico modificato (terreno limoso Templeton (TSL) con compost di funghi, biochar, was tasso di effluenti municipali. Il risultato ha mostrato che il desorbimento delle soluzioni acquose di etanolo di prova rispetto all'acqua è stato più veloce di circa 1 a 3 volte in base al contenuto di liquido alla stessa pressione applicata e al tempo per raggiungere ogni equilibrio. I risultati dell'esperimento sulla sabbia hanno suggerito che quando la concentrazione di soluzione acquosa di etanolo era inferiore al 50 %, le perdite per evaporazione erano inferiori all'1 % e le differenze relative tra il liquido di prova e l'acqua erano inferiori al 10 %. Tuttavia, le perdite per evaporazione sono state dell'11,06 % e del 24,6 %, mentre le differenze relative sono state di circa il 15 % e il 30 % rispettivamente in soluzione al 50 % e al 100 % in soluzione di etanolo. Al contrario, le modifiche organiche nel limo di Templeton non solo hanno aumentato la capacità di ritenzione idrica, ma hanno anche ridotto le perdite di evaporazione. Le perdite di evaporazione nel suolo TSL e TSL con modifiche organiche del suolo sono state dell'1 % in soluzioni con un contenuto di etanolo inferiore al 50 %. Le perdite di evaporazione del 50 % e del 100 % di etanolo sono state rispettivamente del 2,8 % e del 2,9 %. Le differenze relative tra acqua e liquido di prova erano simili all'esperimento della sabbia quando le concentrazioni di liquido di prova erano inferiori al 50 %. Tuttavia, le differenze relative nella soluzione di etanolo al 50 % e al 100 % erano più piccole rispetto al campione di sabbia con circa il 10 % e il 15 %, rispettivamente. Inoltre, l'analisi della differenza relativa ha suggerito che quasi tutte le soluzioni acquose di etanolo avevano un contenuto di liquido volumetrico inferiore alla stessa pressione fornita rispetto all'acqua, che era un riflesso delle soluzioni acquose di etanolo desorbiti più velocemente dell'acqua sotto pressione equivalente. Pertanto, il 10-40 % delle soluzioni di etanolo potrebbe essere considerato un'alternativa per determinare le proprietà idrauliche del suolo a causa del loro tasso di desorbimento più rapido e non essere influenzato dalla idrorepellenza del suolo. A causa dell'evaporazione e della dissoluzione del materiale organico, le soluzioni acquose di etanolo al di sopra del 50% di concentrazione non erano adatte per sabbia grossa o terreno di consistenza media....
