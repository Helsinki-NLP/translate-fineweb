| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Gjennom Bibelen C2000 SeriesSkal vi slå til Apostlenes gjerninger, kapittel ett, som vi begynner vårt studium av den tidlige kirken.<br/>Lukas, forfatteren av Apostlenes gjerninger, en følgesvenn av apostelen Paulus, som også var forfatter av evangeliet i henhold til Lukas, skrev disse to avhandlingene til en venn, Theophilus. Theophilus er et gresk navn. Det er et navn som har en vakker betydning. Navnet betyr elsker av Gud. Det er noen som tror at det ikke var et menneske i det hele tatt, men at evangeliet og Apostlenes gjerninger ble adressert til dem som elsker Gud, hvem dere enn er. Det er andre tradisjoner som sier at Teofilus faktisk var Lukes herre. At i de dager var leger slaver, vanligvis slaven til en velstående patron. Så at Lukas 'mester var Teofilus, og han slapp Lukas til å være med Paulus på misjonsreiser. Dermed skriver Lukas tilbake til sin tidligere mester. Dette er en tidlig tradisjon i kirken, men det er selvfølgelig umulig å bevise, som så mange av tradisjonene.<br/>Det er også de som tror at da Paulus var i Troas, og han fikk et syn av en mann som ropte til ham: Kom over til Makedonia og hjelp oss! For den første som Paulus virkelig møtte da han kom til Makedonia var Lukas. Og som vi er i Apostlenes gjerninger, vil du finne at når vi kommer til den delen av Apostlenes gjerninger, begynner Lukas å skrive mer i den første personen i stedet for den tredje personen. Så det er, tydeligvis, på dette punktet i Apostlenes gjerninger at Lukas ble en følgesvenn av Paulus og begynte å reise med ham. Han begynte å bruke pronomenene "vi" og "oss" i stedet for "dem" og "dem". Dette er uten tvil hvor Lukas ble en deltaker og et øyenvitne til de tingene som skjedde fra dette punktet på. Vi vil bringe dette ut til deg når vi kommer til det punktet.<br/>Han begynner Apostlenes gjerninger ved å knytte det med evangeliet i henhold til Lukas. Det er interessant at det aller siste som Lukas registrerer i sitt evangelium er det aller første han registrerer i Apostlenes gjerninger. Vi finner Lukasevangeliet lukke som Jesus forteller sine disipler å vente i Jerusalem til de er påført med kraft fra det høye. Og så Jesus fór opp til himmelen, og så lukker han evangeliet. I åpningen av Apostlenes gjerninger, skriver han,<br/>Den tidligere avhandlingen [det vil si evangeliet ifølge Lukas] har jeg skrevet til deg, Teofilus, om alt det som Jesus begynte både å gjøre og lære (Apg 1: 1),<br/>Nøkkelordet er begynt. Evangeliet ifølge Lukas er ikke hele historien om Jesu Kristi tjeneste. Det er bare begynnelsen av Jesu Kristi tjeneste. Jesus fortsetter å tjene til behovene til mennesker. Jesus fortsetter å helbrede de syke. Jesus fortsetter å tjene sin kjærlighet og sitt evangelium til verden, bare nå tjener han gjennom de disiplene som er blitt salvet med sin Hellige Ånd. Men Kristi tjeneste fortsetter; i utgangspunktet er premisset som Lukas tar i Apostlenes gjerninger. Den tidligere avhandlingen av alt som Jesus begynte, både å gjøre og å undervise.<br/>På grunn av dette er Apostlenes gjerninger en uferdig bok: ved at Herren i dag fortsetter å arbeide gjennom livene til dem som har innviet seg til å være Guds redskaper. Å bli ledet og veiledet og salvet av Hans Hellige Ånd, for å fortsette Jesu tjeneste i verden i dag. Nå har Gud forordnet at hans arbeid skal utføres gjennom menneskelige instrumenter. Jeg sier ikke at det må utføres. Gud kan bruke engler til sitt verk, og det vil komme en tid under Åpenbaringsboken da Gud vil bruke engler til å forkynne sitt evangelium for mennesker over hele verden. Åpenbaringen, kapittel 14, "Den første engelen flyr midt i himmelen har evig evangelium" (Åp 14,6). Men i dag, Gud har valgt å bruke menneskelige instrumenter. Så ufullkommen som de kan være, men det er det Gud har ordinert til å bruke. Det spennende med det er, Gud vil bruke meg og Gud vil bruke deg. Så mange ganger, vi ber av, "O Herre, jeg kan ikke snakke. Jeg har aldri vært i stand til å snakke før eller til og med nå, Herre." Som Moses prøvde å tigge av Guds kall. Jeremia sa: "Herre, jeg er bare et barn; ingen kommer til å høre på meg." Og vi har alle våre unnskyldninger for hvorfor vi ikke kan bli brukt. Ikke sant? Vi vet alle årsakene til at Gud ikke kunne bruke oss.<br/>En gang da Herren kalte en profet til å gjøre Hans arbeid, sa han: "Herre, send hvem du vil." Herren sa: "Hei, jeg har kalt deg." "Herre, god ide; send hvem du vil." Så ofte er vi i den posisjonen, "Herre, send ved hånden av hvem du vil, noen andre enn meg Herre." Og likevel har Gud ordinert å bruke oss.<br/>Nå, hver av oss kan vise våre egne ufullkommenheter. Hver av oss kan peke ut våre egne mangler, og vi kan alle finne en unnskyldning for hvorfor Gud ikke vil bruke meg. Men likevel, Gud har valgt å bruke deg. Du lurer på når Gud har slike instrumenter for å bruke hvordan han noen gang fikk jobben gjort, ikke sant?<br/>inntil den dag da han blev optatt, efterat han ved den Hellige Ånd hadde gitt sine bud til de apostler som han hadde utvalgt sig,<br/>Det er hva han avsluttet Lukasevangeliet med. Den dagen Jesus ble tatt opp, etter at han hadde fortalt apostlene å vente på begavelsen av makt.<br/>For ham viste han seg også levende for dem etter sin lidelse (eller død) ved mange ufeilbare bevis (Apg 1:3).<br/>Det er vanskelig å nekte det faktum av Jesu Kristi oppstandelse. Jeg ble underholdt, så vel som irritert og irritert, av en artikkel jeg leste i Santa Ana Register denne siste lørdagen. Om skapelsesvitenskapen og evolusjonsteoriene som blir presentert i fylkesskolene. Hvordan det, sa denne ene professoren at han underviser i en vitenskapsklasse, og dermed handler de bare om fakta, og at de ikke har noe sted for teorier. Fordi vitenskapen er basert på fakta og skapelsen er basert på religiøs overtro. Det tar mye tro å tro på de religiøse teoriene. Når du har å gjøre med fakta, kan du bare akseptere dem. Jeg tenkte, "Veldig interessant i den vitenskapsklassen, de lærte meg at det var et faktum at verden var fire milliarder år gammel. Nå lærer de i dag at det er et faktum at verden er tolv milliarder år gammel. Og det er ikke så lenge siden jeg gikk på skolen.»<br/>Det er interessant at Bibelen aldri har behøvd å bli revidert eller oppdatert for å møte dagens data som menn har oppdaget. Og likevel, hvis du ville ta mine high school science lærebøker i dag og prøve å lære en science klasse fra dem, ville du finne at mange av de tingene som ble lært som vitenskapelig faktum da jeg var i high school er ikke lenger anerkjent som vitenskapelig faktum. Den enkle cellen protoplasma er ikke lenger en enkel celle, men ekstremt kompleks. Hvis det er noe faktum som kan attesteres i historien, er det faktum av Jesu Kristi oppstandelse fra de døde.<br/>Vi har et rettssystem som er basert på vitneutsagn. Hvis en mann er anklaget for en forbrytelse, og det er folk som var vitne til at forbrytelsen ble begått, og de er brakt til standarden, og de sverger å fortelle sannheten, hele sannheten, og ingenting annet enn sannheten, så hjelpe dem Gud. Og i deres avhør bekrefter de at: "Jeg så den mannen i banken den tjuetredje mai. Jeg så ham trekke ut en pistol fra kappen sin. Jeg hørte ham kreve at alle pengene ble gitt til ham. Jeg så ham da han forlot banken. Og jeg så ham da betjenten grep ham utenfor. Og hvis du kan få tre eller fire vitner til å peke på denne mannen, og vil holde sitt vitnesbyrd under korsprøve, da blir denne mannen dømt skyldig. Det er han som har gjort det. Vi har to eller tre vitner som vitner om den samme historien om den mannen, og det er akseptert som faktum at han er den som begikk forbrytelsen og er skyldig. Du har vitner som har sverget å fortelle sannheten som de bekrefter.<br/>Etter Jesu død, da han sto opp igjen, viste han seg for mange forskjellige mennesker som avla ed på at de så ham, at de snakket med ham, at han viste seg for dem på forskjellige steder under forskjellige omstendigheter. og han var hos dem i firti dager, og på én gang viste han sig for så mange som fem hundre mennesker som var kommet sammen til ett sted, og det er vanskelig å fornekte eller avvise dette folks vidnesbyrd. Å gjøre det er å diskreditere hele vårt rettssystem. Men ikke bare det, disse mennene som vitnet om at de så den oppstandne Herren, at de snakket med ham, at de spiste sammen med ham, de, alle unntatt en, møtte voldelige dødsfall fra andre mennesker fordi de bekreftet at historien de fortalte var sann. Du snakker om vitner som sverget å fortelle sannheten, hele sannheten, ingenting annet enn sannheten. Hvis en persons liv ble truet på grunn av det vitnet, og det var en løgn, ville minst en av dem ha brutt under presset. De ville ha tilstått hele bløffen. "Han viste seg levende etter sin lidenskap ved mange ufeilbarlige bevis."<br/>Han ble sett av dem i førti dager og talte til dem om det som hører Guds rike til (Apg 1,3).<br/>Noen ganger klandrer vi disiplene på grunn av deres spørsmål om tidspunktet for Guds rike. La det bli husket at Guds rike var favorittemnet til Jesus Kristus. Han snakket alltid om Guds rike, og det er et stort håp at han var plantet i hjertene til alle mennesker. Ting er ikke alltid kommer til å fortsette fordervet som de er. Verden skal ikke for alltid gå under mørkets makt, under ondskapens trelldom. Gud skal en dag etablere sitt rike på jorden. Et rike med rettferdig glede og fred. "Jesus skal regjere der hvor solen går, og hans rike skal strekke seg fra kyst til kyst." Og den dagen vil være den mest strålende dagen verden noensinne har sett, da sykdom og lidelse og smerte vil bli avskaffet i hans rike. Som synd og grådighet og disse tingene som har gjort verden til et uutholdelig sted, vil bli avskaffet i hans rike. Den gudløse kommersialismen, utnyttelsen av mennesket, alle disse tingene avskaffet i hans herlige rike når han regjerer. Ikke rart disiplene var ivrige etter å få det på. Jeg er ivrig etter å få det på; Jeg er ivrig etter at hans rike skal komme. Og Jesus fortalte oss når vi ber, den første bønnen er: "Komme ditt rike. La din vilje skje på jorden, som det er i himmelen" (Matt 6:10 ). Dette er den rette slags ønske som vi alle bør ha. Jeg ønsker Guds rike. Og så talte han til dem, i løpet av denne førti dagers perioden, om riket.<br/>Og da han var kommet sammen med dem, bød han dem at de ikke skulde vike fra Jerusalem, men bie på det som Faderen hadde lovt, som I, sa han, har hørt om mig.<br/>Han sa: «Se, nå må dere vente her i Jerusalem til dere får det som er lovt av Faderen.» Og det skal skje i de siste dager, sier Herren, da vil jeg utøse min Ånd over alt kjød, og eders sønner og eders døtre skal tale profetiske ord, og eders unge menn skal ha drømmer, og eders oldinger skal se syner; og over mine tjenere og mine tjenestepiker vil jeg utøse min Ånd, sier Herren. Den dag kommer da Gud skal utgyte sin Ånd over alt kjød, over alle de troende, og de skal alle få kraft av Gud.<br/>For Johannes døpte med vann, men dere skal om ikke mange dager bli døpt med Den Hellige Ånd» (Apg 1,5).<br/>Ideen om dåpen var at av emersion, the bapteedzo. John døpte med vann, nedsenket folk i vann, "du skal bli nedsenket i Den Hellige Ånd i ikke mange dager."<br/>Da de nu var kommet sammen, spurte de ham og sa: Herre! gjenreiser du på den tid riket for Israel?<br/>"Når vil det være, Herre? Når er tiden for denne gjenopprettelsen?" Og Jesus snakker til dem nå, ikke om riket, men om den kraften som de skal få for tjeneste. Og så Han børster til side deres spørsmål.<br/>7 Han sa til dem: Det tilkommer ikke eder å vite tider eller timer som min Fader har fastsatt av sin egen makt;<br/>"Det er ikke for deg å vite." De levde hele tiden i påvente av den umiddelbare opprettelsen av riket. I hele Jesu levetid ventet de ham når som helst å gå inn i telefonkiosken og komme ut som verdens frelser. Shazzam! Viser sin makt og styrter verdens regjeringer, etablerer Guds rike på jorden. Og de ventet daglig på at denne forandringen skulle skje. Og hver gang Jesus talte om å dra til Jerusalem, bli overgitt i hendene på et syndig menneske, og så bli korsfestet, sa han: Å nei, Herre. Nei, du forstår ikke riket, Herre. Så langt borte fra deg være! Da Jesus døde på korset, ble alle skuffet.<br/>De to disiplene på vei til Emmaus, så trist. "Hei, karer. Hvorfor er du så trist som du går sammen? "Hva mener du? Du må være en fremmed rundt her hvis du ikke vet hva som har skjedd i det siste i Jerusalem." "Hvilke ting?" "Å, en mann ved navn Jesus fra Nasaret ... å menneske, det var mektig og mektig. Guds salvelse var over hans liv. Vi hadde håpet at i ham var Israels utfrielse, men de korsfestet ham. Vi hadde håpet . . . nå er han død." Nå har Han stått opp, og Han sier: "Om noen få dager, karer, skal dere få Faderens løfte." "Å, hvilket løfte? Løftet om opprettelsen av riket?" Du skjønner, det var legitimt at de skulle spørre. "Er dette Herre? Greit! Er dette tiden? Vil du opprette ditt rike nå? "Nei. Det er ikke for dere å vite de tider som Faderen har bestemt, eller som Faderen har i sin egen makt. Men dere skal få kraft når Den Hellige Ånd kommer over dere."<br/>Nå her, den greske preposisjonen epi brukes til å betegne et nytt forhold som de skulle ha med Den Hellige Ånd. I evangeliet ifølge Johannes, kapittel 14, som Jesus er der lovende å sende Den Hellige Ånd, sa han: "Jeg vil ikke forlate deg ukomfortabelt. Jeg vil komme til dere og be Faderen, og han skal sende dere en annen talsmann, sannhetens Ånd, som verden ikke kan ta imot fordi den ikke ser ham og heller ikke kjenner ham, men dere kjenner ham, for han blir hos dere og skal være i dere» (Joh 14:17-18). Samme greske preposisjon som vår, bare de staver det "en" i stedet for "i". Todelt forhold der i Johannes: Han er med deg, men han skal bo i deg. Men nå sa Jesus at du skal få kraft når Den Hellige Ånd kommer over deg. Den greske preposisjonen epi, som er oversatt i forskjellige tekster gjennom hele Det nye testamente som "på" eller "over" eller jeg liker det, "overløper".<br/>På den siste dag, den store festdag, da Jesus stod på tempelberget og ropte til folket: Om nogen tørster, han komme til mig og drikke! og den som drikker av det vann jeg vil gi, fra hans liv skal det strømme ut strømmer av levende vann. Johannes sa: "Dette sa han om Ånden, som ennå ikke var gitt, som de som tror på ham skulle få" (Joh 7:37-39 ). Hva sa han om Ånden? At det skulle være som en strøm av levende vann som strømmer ut. Jeg liker, "Når Ånden flommer over deg," over deg, eller over deg, eller flommer fra deg. Så det trefoldige forholdet: Han er med deg før din omvendelse, han er den som får deg til å innse at du er en synder, han er den som peker på Jesus Kristus som svaret når han overbeviser verden om synd, om rettferdighet og om dom. I det øyeblikket du åpner ditt liv og hjerte for Jesus Kristus og inviterer ham til å komme inn, kommer Den Hellige Ånd og begynner å bo i deg. Han skal være i deg. "Vet dere ikke at dere ikke er deres egne, dere er kjøpt for en pris, så herliggjør derfor Gud i deres legeme og i deres ånd som er Hans. Og vet dere ikke at deres legeme er et tempel for Den Hellige Ånd som er i dere? Drikk dere ikke fulle på vin, som det er overflod av, men bli fylt av Ånden" (1 Kor 6:19-20, Ef 5:18). Men her er et tredje forhold. Dette er en styrkende erfaring.<br/>Dere skal få kraft når Den Hellige Ånd kommer over dere, og dere skal være vitner om meg (Apg 1:8).<br/>Og så dynamikken, å være et vitne for Jesus Kristus. Det er interessant at ordet vitne på gresk er ordet martus fra der vi får vårt ord martyr. Og på gresk betyr det martyr. Et vitne er en som ikke bare forkynner hva han tror, han lever hva han tror, han er hva han tror, og han tror det så sterkt, at hvis det er nødvendig, vil han dø for det han tror. Det er hvor sterk hans tro er. Han er en martus. Han er ikke redd for å dø for det han tror på.<br/>Dere husker da Paulus var på vei tilbake til Jerusalem og Agabus var kommet ned fra Cæsarea, og han tok beltet til Paulus og bandt seg selv opp og sa: «Slik er det også med den mannen som eier dette beltet, at han skal bindes når han kommer til Jerusalem.» Og Paulus' venner begynte å gråte og sa: "Å, Paulus, ikke gå, ikke gå." Og han sa: "Hva mener du med disse tårene? Tror du at du vil avskrekke meg? Tror du jeg er bekymret for å bli bundet? Jeg er klar til å dø." Han var en martus. Jeg er rede til å dø; men blev du drept for din tros skyld, så var det ikke til martyrdøden du blev drept, fordi du var en martyr, men til et vidne, fordi du trodde så fast på det. Så det gjorde deg ikke til et vitne, det viste bare hva du var. Du var et vitne hele tiden. Hvis du ikke hadde vært en martus, ville du aldri ha gått i døden. Du ville ha trukket seg; du ville ha sagt, "Whoa, whoa, vent, vent. Hold ut, la oss endre kurs her. Jeg tror jeg kan ha gjort en feil." Så sier du, "Vel, han var ikke en martus. Å stjele en hest gjør deg ikke til en hestetyv; det beviser bare at du var. Ingen stjeler en hest med mindre han er en hestetyv. Så å stjele det gjør deg ikke til en hestetyv, det beviser bare at du var hele tiden. Å være martyr beviser bare at du var et vitne, en martus. "Og du vil være vitner." Og er det ikke interessant at de fleste av dem ble martyrer? "Vitner til meg."<br/>Vitnet skulle være både i Jerusalem og i hele Judea (Apg 1:8).<br/>Vitnet begynte hjemme. Det vanskeligste stedet, er det ikke? Det er å starte rett hjemme i Jerusalem, og deretter området rundt Jerusalem, området av Judea. Og så var det å spre seg inn i Samaria. Og så var det å gå ut til de ytterste delene av verden. Og når vi studerer Apostlenes gjerninger, vil vi se denne selve progresjonen. Hvordan vitnet begynte i Jerusalem. Vi får det i neste kapittel. Og så skal vi se, hvordan det begynte å utbre seg i Judea, og så drog Filip opp til Samaria, og til sist ble Paulus og Barnabas kalt til å dra til de fjerneste deler av verden. Og slik spredte vitnesbyrdet seg gjennom salvelsen og Den Hellige Ånds kraft.<br/>Da han hadde sagt dette, ble han løftet opp mens de så på, og en sky tok ham bort fra deres øyne (Apg 1,9).<br/>Dette er det siste løftet Jesus ga sine disipler. Dette er det, de siste ordene før Hans himmelfart. Selvfølgelig, senere kom han og snakket med Paulus og andre, men før Hans himmelfart, dette er Hans siste ord. Og da han hadde sagt dette, blev han løftet op mens de så på, og en sky tok ham bort fra deres øine.<br/>Og mens de stirret opp mot himmelen idet han fór opp, se, da sto to menn hos dem i hvite klær (Apg 1,10).<br/>Vi antar at de var engler.<br/>Og han sa: I galileiske menn! hvorfor står I og ser op mot himmelen? denne Jesus som er optatt fra eder til himmelen, han skal komme igjen på samme måte som I så ham fare op til himmelen.<br/>De så ham da han fór opp til himmelen, og de skal se ham når han kommer igjen. ”Se, Herren kommer med sine tusener av hellige for å holde dom over jorden” (Jud 1:14-15). Og så, "Til ham som elsket oss og ga seg selv for oss, og som har gjort oss til vår Gud, konger og prester som skal regjere med ham på jorden: Se, Herren kommer, og hvert øye skal se ham, og de som har gjennomstunget ham, skal sørge" Åp 1:5-7. Så Herrens komme. Hvert øye skal se ham. Jehovas vitner sier at han allerede er kommet, men det var et hemmelig komme. Siden det bare var disiplene som så ham gå, var det bare disiplene, av Jehovas vitner, som så ham komme tilbake. Men Jesus sa: «Hvis de sier til dere: ‘Han er kommet i det skjulte’ og har gått inn i et hemmelig rom, så tro det ikke.» (Matt 24:26) Så dere må velge, om dere vil tro Jesus eller dem.<br/>«Denne Jesus, som er tatt opp fra dere til himmelen, skal komme igjen på samme måte som dere så ham fare opp til himmelen.»<br/>Nå er det et veldig interessant vers i II Joh, vers 1:7 , "For mange bedragere er kommet inn i verden som ikke bekjenner at Jesus Kristus er kommet i kjød." Det er dessverre en dårlig oversettelse av det greske. For dette partisipp er i nåtid og skal oversettes "kommer i kjødet." De som ville benekte at Jesus Kristus kommer i kjødet. Hva sier Johannes om dem? "De er en bedrager og en antikrist. Ta eder i vare at I ikke mister det I har vunnet ved eders gjerninger, men at I kan få full lønn! for den som bryter Kristi lære og ikke blir i den, han har ikke Gud. Den som blir i Kristi lære, han har både Faderen og Sønnen. Og om nogen kommer til eder og ikke fører denne lære, da ta ikke imot ham i eders hus, og by ham ikke farvel! For den som sier farvel til ham, er delaktig i hans onde gjerninger" (2 Joh 1:7-11). Spør dem ett spørsmål, "Kommer Jesus i kjød?" Bare spør dem det spørsmålet. Og hvis de sier nei, bare husk hva Johannes advarte deg og hva Johannes fortalte deg. "Hvis noen ikke bekjenner at Jesus Kristus kommer i kjødet." Husker du da han var sammen med disiplene og sa: "Gi meg noe å spise?" Han sa: "Dere vet, ånder spiser ikke; rør meg. Se? Det er meg." Så kommer da denne Jesus igjen, likesom de så ham fare op til himmelen, og jeg tror at han kommer snart.<br/>Da vendte de tilbake til Jerusalem fra det berg som kalles Oljeberget og ligger nær ved Jerusalem, en sabbatsreise derfra. Og da de var kommet dit, gikk de op på den sal hvor de holdt til både Peter og Jakob og Andreas, Filip og Tomas og Bartolomeus og Matteus, Jakob, Alfeus' sønn, og Simon ivreren og Judas, Jakobs bror. Og alle disse fortsatte i enighet i bønn og påkallelse, med kvinnene, og Maria, Jesu mor, og med hans brødre (Apg 1:12-14).<br/>Dette er den siste omtalen av Maria, Jesu mor. På dette punktet og fra dette punktet er det ingen ytterligere omtale av henne i Apostlenes gjerninger eller i brevene. Ingen omtale av hennes død eller hennes mirakuløse oppstigning til himmelen, uten død. Det står ikke noe om det i Skriften, det er taushet.<br/>Hans brødre ville sannsynligvis være en referanse til Jakob og til Judas og til de andre brødrene som var sønner av Josef og Maria.<br/>Det øvre rommet - det er noen som sier at det er det samme øvre rommet der Jesus hadde det siste måltidet med disiplene sine. Og likevel er det andre som holder til dette øvre rommet som et rom i tempelområdet der den tidlige kirken møttes. Ta ditt valg.<br/>Og i de dager stod Peter opp midt iblant disiplene, og sa, (antallet av deres navn var rundt ett hundre og tjue,) menn og brødre, dette skriftstedet må nødvendigvis ha blitt oppfylt, som Den Hellige Ånd talte ved Davids munn før om Judas, som var en veileder for dem som tok Jesus (Apg 1:15-16).<br/>De venter i bønn og påkallelse, og Peter reiser seg og sier: "Dere, det er et skriftsted som må oppfylles." Og du vet at han kommer til å gå videre, "La oss få programmet til å gå, la oss kaste lodd og finne ut hvem som skal ta Judas plass." Jeg føler at Peter var igjen i kjødet, og manifesterte den impulsive naturen som var hans. Og jeg tror at menighetens fremtidige historie i Apostlenes gjerninger peker på dette. Jeg er interessert i Peters forståelse av skriftene, hvordan han siterer fra så mange steder i Det gamle testamente. Peter viser en veldig stor forståelse av de gammeltestamentlige skriftene som er et poeng i hans favør.<br/>Legg merke til at Peter tilskriver til Den Hellige Ånd de tingene som David skrev. Så, "Hele Skriften er gitt ved inspirasjon fra Gud" (2Ti 3:16). Ikke en del av Skriftene. Fordi, hvis du forteller meg at en del av Skriftene er gitt ved inspirasjon fra Gud, så må jeg spørre deg: "Hvilke deler er ved inspirasjon og hvilke deler er ikke ved inspirasjon?" Og så er du autoriteten som forteller meg hvilken del jeg kan tro på og hvilken del jeg ikke kan tro på, og så snart Gud ikke lenger er autoriteten, men du er autoriteten, er jeg i trøbbel. Ta dere i vare for dem som sier: «Dere kan ikke tro alt som står i Skriftene, for Skriftene selv sier: Alt som står i Skriftene, er inspirert av Gud.» Og her skriver Lukas om det som Peter sier: David var virkelig en talsmann for den Hellige Ånd, og om Judas talte den Hellige Ånd ved Davids munn.<br/>For han var regnet blant oss, og han hadde fått en del av denne tjenesten. Men nå har denne mannen kjøpt en åker for urettferdighetens lønn, og falt hodestups (Apg 1:17-18)<br/>Han kjøpte åkeren, pottemakerens åker, slik Sakarja sier i det ellevte kapitlet.<br/>og faller hodestups, han brast i midten, og alle hans innvoller strømmet ut (Apg 1:18).<br/>Det er de som finner en uoverensstemmelse i skriftene, fordi i et av evangeliene blir vi fortalt at da Judas kom tilbake og prøvde å returnere pengene, og de sa, "Hei, det er ditt problem. Vi kan ikke ta det." Og legg det tilbake i tempelkassen. "Det er blodpenger." Så kastet han det der på gulvet i templet, og han gikk ut og hengte seg. Her forteller Peter oss at han falt hodestups og bare spratt. Og det er de som forestiller seg en uoverensstemmelse. Veldig enkelt, han gikk opp i treet for å henge seg, bundet tauet rundt halsen og bundet den til lem og hoppet. Og kraften av fallet enten knakk tauet eller hodet, og han falt på ned i canyon og akkurat som han sa det her.<br/>Og det blev vitterlig for alle dem som bodde i Jerusalem, at marken kalles med deres tunge Akeldama, det er blodåkeren. For det står skrevet i Salmenes bok: La hans bolig bli øde, og la ingen bo der; og: Hans biskop la en annen ta (Apg 1:19-20).<br/>Nå i virkeligheten siterer han fra to forskjellige salmer her. Fra Sal 69:25 setter han det sammen med Sal 109:8 . Og setter de to sammen finner han disse profetiene om Judas.<br/>Derfor av disse menn (Apg 1:21)<br/>Nå er det her de leter etter noen til å ta Judas plass som apostel. Her er kvalifikasjonene de lette etter på den tiden.<br/>Derfor, av disse menn som har fulgt oss hele tiden Herren Jesus var iblant oss (Apg 1:21),<br/>Nå husker du at det var mange disipler, mange disipler som Jesus valgte ti til å være apostler. Og ordet apostel betyr "en som er sendt ut." Eller valgte tolv til å være apostler, så han sendte ut de tolv. Tallet på menneskelige regjeringer. "Vi har bare elleve. Vi trenger en til å ta Judas plass, men vi trenger en som har vært med oss hele tiden fra begynnelsen med Jesus."<br/>Fra den tiden han ble døpt av Johannes, til den dagen han ble tatt opp fra oss, må en bli ordinert til å være et vitne [om hva?] av hans oppstandelse (Apg 1:22).<br/>Og dette var de krav som de ventet på, noen som hadde vært rundt hele tiden, fra tiden av Johannes dåp til himmelfarten. Og en som så den oppstandne Herren, og slik kunne bære vitnesbyrd om oppstandelsen, deres vitnesbyrd om dette faktum.<br/>Nå apostelen Paulus, senere i å hevde det faktum at han var en apostel sa: "Har jeg ikke sett den oppstandne Kristus?" Tydeligvis var det en av kravene til apostelskapet. Noen spurte meg: "Er det apostler i dag?" Vel, jeg vet ikke. Jeg tror ikke at det er i samme forstand som de var i Det nye testamente. Sikkert er det ingen i dag som kan vitne om oppstandelsen som de gjorde.<br/>Og de stilte frem to, Josef, som kaltes Barsabbas, han som hadde tilnavnet Justus, og Mattias, og bad og sa: Du, Herre, som kjenner alles hjerter! vis oss hvem du har utvalgt av disse to,<br/>Jeg tror at vi ofte gjør denne feilen ved å gi Herren to valg, begge feil. Begrense Gud, du skjønner. Vi er så tilbøyelige til å gjøre dette. Åpenbart var Paulus Guds valg. Peter var impulsiv, og hoppet på pistolen og sa, "Hei, vi må gjøre noe, du vet, vi må hjelpe Gud ut. Du vet, en er savnet, og vi må fylle ham ut." Og likevel, "Gud, hvilken av disse to vil du ha?" Og gi Gud de to valgene.<br/>forat han skulde få del i denne tjeneste og dette apostelembete, som Judas ved sin overtredelse falt fra, forat han skulde gå til sitt eget sted. Og så kastet de lodd om dem (Apg 1:25-26)<br/>En interessant måte som de forsøkte å bestemme Guds vilje. La oss kaste terninger, finne ut hva Guds vilje er her. Det er interessant for meg, de ulike måtene som folk har tenkt å skjelne Guds vilje. Nå, i Det gamle testamentes tid hadde de en interessant måte å komme til presten på, som ville spørre Herren for dem gjennom urim og tummim, "lysene og fullkommenhetene." Nøyaktig hva disse urim og tummim var, vet vi ikke. Jeg er sikker på at de ikke var de fargede brillene som Joseph Smith fant med Golden Tablets; de magiske brillene, at når du setter dem på, kan du plutselig lese hieroglyfisk skriving.<br/>Det er de som sier at urim og tummim faktisk var en svart og en hvit stein som ble båret i en pose på prestens bryst. De ville be og spørre Herren et bestemt spørsmål. Du husker at David spurte Herren bestemte spørsmål: "Herre, skal vi gå ut mot filisterne?" Svaret var: "Nei." Så igjen, neste dag: "Herre, skal vi gå ut mot filisterne?" Svaret var: "Ja." "Når skal vi gå ut?" De ville stille spesifikke spørsmål, og Herren ville lede dem gjennom Urim og Tommen. De sier at presten ville be, søke Gud, og deretter nå inn og trekke ut en av de to steinene. Hvis det var den hvite steinen, var det et ja svar. Hvis det var et nei, så ville det være den svarte steinen som han ville trekke ut. Noen sier til og med at vi får begrepet svartballed fra dette Urim og Thummim. Faktisk, tilbake i originalen er det en nei-stemme mot et bestemt prosjekt eller en ide. Vi vet ikke hva urim og tummim var, men i Det gamle testamentet brukte de en metode for å kaste lodd for å finne ut hva som var Guds vilje.<br/>Så her plukker disiplene opp det samme som de kaster terningene for å se hvilken av de to karene som Gud hadde valgt å erstatte Judas Iskariot.<br/>Loddet falt på Mattias, og han ble regnet sammen med de elleve (Apg 1:26).<br/>Nå hvem i verden er Matthias? Ingen har hørt om ham før eller siden. Det vil være interessant å møte Matthias og finne ut hvem han er og hva han gjorde. Jeg tror fra den etterfølgende historien, er det åpenbart å anta at Gud valgte Paulus som apostel. Paulus sier det selv. Nå er det siste gang vi leser om dem som søker å skjelne Guds vilje ved å kaste lodd eller ved en slags tilfeldighet.<br/>Jeg kjenner en medarbeider i dag, som søker å skjelne Herrens vilje, vil be og stille Herren et spørsmål. Han har ti pennies i lommen, og mens han ber, tar han pennies med øynene lukket og legger dem på bordet, og hvis de alle kommer opp hodene, er det et ja. En interessant ting, hver gang på en stund, vil de alle komme opp hoder, og det er ganske gode odds. Likevel finner vi ikke noe mønster for dette etter at Den Hellige Ånd ble gitt. Når Den Hellige Ånd kom over menigheten, da begynte Den Hellige Ånd å tale til dem og lede dem. Og Den Hellige Ånd sa: "Avdel meg Paulus og Barnabas for tjenesten der jeg har kalt dem" (Apg 13:2 ). Og Den Hellige Ånd sendte dem ut. Så finner vi menigheten mer direkte ledet av Den Hellige Ånd. Når Den Hellige Ånd kom, ble denne kaste terninger for å finne ut Guds vilje satt til side.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James versjon<br/><br/>Dette er King James Version of the Holy Bible (også kjent som den autoriserte versjonen) fra 1769. |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stemmespolen er festet til membranen som da vil bevege seg frem og tilbake og skape en lydbølge. Det samme skjer i omvendt, hvis du flytter en spole gjennom en magnet, produserer du en strøm i stedet.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell er nerfing brawlers i stedet for nerfing stjernekrefter. Jeg var på 750 forrige sesong med power 8 nita, og det er veldig vanskelig å gå forbi at, som, stjernekrefter spiller en virkelig dominerende rolle. Matchmaking er også søppel. Når jeg spiller gem grab (rundt 600 trofeer), er det ofte matchups hvor fiendens lag har en mer spiller enn oss som er maksed, og det er ikke engang at vi har en lvl 9 for å konkurrere mot det. Noen ganger er det til og med matchups der fiendens lag er fullt maksimert og ingen av oss er. Dette er grunnen til at jeg ikke spiller brawl stars seriøst lenger. Det er ikke engang som om det ikke er mange spillere som ikke er maksimert og rundt 600 trofeer. Det er irriterende.<br/>Edit: Jeg tror supercell bør ha minst en grunnleggende mekanisme som tar gjennomsnittet av nivåer av bråkmakere når du setter opp kamper.<br/><br/>Bortsett fra trofeer indikerer egentlig ikke ferdighetene dine. De indikerer ferdighetene til lagkameratene du er plassert med. Og jeg har det bra med å spille mot høyere nivåbrawlere, men når ett lag er på nivå 10 og det andre laget ikke er, er det klart at det er ubalansert.<br/><br/>Jeg reccomend å få noen gode venner til å spille med, meg og 2 venner fikk mine venner makt 1 hake til å rangere 28 ved å spille perle grab med en viss sammensetning hele dagen, og vi gjorde det uten at en eneste av oss blir maksed med våre bråkmakere.<br/><br/>Jeg vet hvordan du føler at jeg pleide å ha bråkmakere i høye trofeer med lavt nivå, og det er for vanskelig å gå videre og alt jeg sa til meg selv "Jeg vil ha stjernekrefter" virkelig supercell trenger å gjøre balanse til stjernekrefter eller i det minste gjøre en bedre matchmaking system.<br/><br/>Jeg føler dette. Jeg er ikke så god på spillet som deg, men jeg fikk Emz til 500 på makt 1 og matchmaking var forferdelig. Maxed ut spillere overalt! Og det hjalp ikke at flertallet av mine lagkamerater hadde rundt 5-8k trofeer ... Jeg måtte ty til solo-oppgjør i siste øyeblikk fordi jeg enten kan overfalle intetanende spillere eller bare spille litt aggressivt til rett tid. Men jeg skulle virkelig ønske at det kunne være litt enklere for folk som ønsker å presse bråkmakere til virkelig høye troféområder uten å ha luksusen av stjernekrefter.<br/><br/>Altho spike er fortsatt bra uten curveball. Curveball var bare en hjelp for å treffe skuddene dine oftere som spike. Men selv før curveball ble utgitt, var spike en veldig sterk bråkmaker, så han vil forbli den samme nå.<br/><br/>Jeg er enig i at de burde ha nervert bakhold, men jeg tror de prøver å balansere både Snappy Sniping og Ambush, da de begge blir slått sammen med denne endringen. Hun ble litt kraftig, men fortsatt ikke nerveverdig<br/><br/>Jeg er ikke sikker på dette, men nå som Darryl fikk en merkbar buff, ser det ut til at Darryl kan overskygge Bull, da han ikke bare alltid kan håndtere mer skade enn Bull, han vil ikke dø så tidlig lenger, så deres overlevelsesevne vil være lik uten stjernekraft (selv om Bulls overlevelsesevne fortsatt er merkbart bedre enn Darryls hvis han hadde Tøffe Guys). Ikke bare det, Darryl super kan automatisk regenerere, noe som betyr at Darryl kan spilles effektivt både som en tungvekter OG en leiemorder på samme tid (før han suger som en tungvekter, men anstendig som en leiemorder)<br/><br/>Men han er overvurdert af. Og du får trofeer med ham veldig lett. Så im kinda ok med nerven. Jeg har ikke engang spilt ham siden da jeg fikk ham til 500 (rundt 5 måneder siden), så ikke at jeg bryr meg så mye heller.<br/><br/>Hvorfor får ikke Poco/Penny en HP nerve, hvis de er Marksman/Healer henholdsvis ikke en tank?<br/>Hvorfor er ikke Rosas tankyness nervøs, hoste 70% skadereduksjon?<br/>Hvorfor er Tick lov til å ha den høyeste rekkevidden og den mest gratis pokedamage i hele spillet?<br/>Hvorfor får ikke Leon en HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Vær det som det kan, det var Ambush som var OP, ikke base Piper. Jeg vil hevde at Ambush er den beste stjernekraften i spillet (nå enda mer så siden prosentandelen av skadeøkning indirekte gikk opp) og base Piper var en bunn-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Hva Supercell bør gjøre er å reversere begge nerver, redusere Ambush til 600, og redusere Snappy Sniping til 0,25 siden det ville bli indirekte buffed av basen skade buff.<br/><br/>Ja, og jeg tror de gikk litt for langt med Rosa, for nå er hun i utgangspunktet den bedre oksen nå når det gjelder tanking, som hun har vært en stund. Nå kan Darryl like gjerne være en mindre, kraftigere okse<br/><br/>Hvorfor? Jeg føler at hun trenger en buff i nesten alt unntatt hennes stjernekraft. Hennes helse og fart gjør henne super litt vanskeligere å bruke, fordi hun kan dø ganske enkelt, og det er veldig vanskelig for henne å fange raskere bråkmakere som Crow. Hennes stjernekraft er litt ødelagt, men... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Selvstendig næringsvirksomhet del 1<br/><br/>Når du aksepterer en sysselsetting i enhver organisasjon, må du utføre ulike jobber i henhold til kravene til arbeidsgiveren din, og du kan få et fast inntektsbeløp som lønn. Du kan drive en liten butikk, skreddersøm butikk, restaurant, bakeri og konfekt, skjønnhetssalong, etc. i din lokalitet. Du kan bli engasjert i handel eller produksjon på en liten skala eller gi noen tjeneste for en pris. Slike økonomiske aktiviteter er kjent som selvstendig næringsdrivende.<br/><br/>Betydningen av selvstendig næringsvirksomhet<br/><br/>Vår far, mor, brødre, søstre og andre kan være engasjert i ulike økonomiske aktiviteter som de tjener sitt levebrød. Disse personene er engasjert i en økonomisk aktivitet som kalles lønnsarbeid eller lønnet arbeid. Men det er mange personer som engasjerer seg i et yrke eller en virksomhet som de starter og administrerer på egen hånd. De legger i sin beste innsats og ta alle typer risiko for å forfølge sine karrierer med hell. Hele inntekten av sitt arbeid går til dem. Alle av oss har sett små dagligvarebutikker, skreddersøm butikker, medisinske butikker etc. i vår lokalitet. Disse eies og styres av en person, med eller uten hjelp av noen assistenter. Deres økonomiske aktiviteter kalles selvstendig næringsdrivende. Så når en person engasjerer seg i noen økonomisk aktivitet og styrer den på egen hånd, er det kjent som selvstendig næringsdrivende.<br/><br/>Målsettinger<br/><br/>Etter å ha studert denne leksjonen, vil du kunne:<br/><br/>Bilde av mål<br/><br/>Bilde av mål<br/><br/>Kjennetegn ved selvstendig næringsvirksomhet<br/><br/>Det innebærer eierskap og styring av aktiviteter av en person selv om han / hun kan ta hjelp av en eller to personer for å hjelpe ham / henne. Dermed kan selvstendig næringsdrivende gi sysselsetting til andre personer også.<br/><br/>Inntjeningen fra selvstendig næringsdrivende er ikke fast. Det avhenger av inntekten man kan tjene ved å produsere eller kjøpe og selge varer eller tilby tjenester til andre til en pris.<br/><br/>I selvstendig næringsdrivende må eieren alene ta overskuddet og bære risikoen for tap. Så finner vi en direkte sammenheng mellom innsatsen og belønningen i selvstendig næringsdrivende.<br/><br/>Det krever en viss mengde kapitalinvesteringer, selv om det kan være lite.<br/><br/>I selvstendig næringsdrivende er en person fri til å ta beslutninger med hensyn til å drive sin virksomhet lønnsomt og benytte seg av enhver mulighet som kan komme opp for utvidelse av sin virksomhet. Det gir full frihet til å arbeide etter sin egen vilje og innenfor rammene av de rådende lover.<br/><br/>Selvstendig næringsvirksomhet kan således defineres som en økonomisk aktivitet som man kan utføre på egen hånd som lønnet arbeid, og dette kan bestå av produksjon og salg av varer, kjøp og salg av varer eller gjengivelse av tjenester til en pris. |
