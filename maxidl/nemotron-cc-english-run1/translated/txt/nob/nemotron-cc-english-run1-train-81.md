| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | I dag er det 49 år siden president Lyndon B. Johnson signerte stemmerettsloven av 1965.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>For nesten et århundre siden erklærte det 15. tillegget til grunnloven: "Retten til amerikanske borgere til å stemme skal ikke nektes eller forkortes av USA eller av noen stat på grunn av rase, farge eller tidligere tilstand av trelldom." Og nesten et århundre før det, satte vår nasjons grunnleggere i gang det store eksperimentet med amerikansk demokrati ved å erklære at "alle menn er skapt likeverdige."<br/><br/>Stemmerettsloven av 1965 var en forsinket anerkjennelse av at selv i Amerika bærer våre grunnleggende idealer liten vekt hvis de ikke er beskyttet av rettsstaten. Det er derfor avsnitt 2 i det 15. endringen ga kongressen "makt til å håndheve denne artikkelen ved passende lovgivning."<br/><br/>Og faktisk var det kodifiserte språket i stemmerettsloven i stand til å oppnå det som Reconstruction-era-kongressen og Thomas Jefferson ikke kunne. Borgerrettighetsloven av 1964 og Stemmerettsloven – og borgerrettighetsbevegelsen som de kom fra – fungerte som katalysator for en dramatisk økning i muligheten for svarte amerikanere til å delta i den demokratiske prosessen.<br/><br/>I 1962 var for eksempel bare 6,7 prosent av de svarte innbyggerne i Mississippi registrert som stemmeberettigede, og i 1969 hadde tallet nådd 66,5 prosent.<br/><br/>Beskyttelsene som ble innført ved stemmerettsloven, var lenge forsinket da de ble vedtatt, noe som representerte den harde kampen de ble oppnådd med. Men utenkelig er disse beskyttelsene nå under angrep, og truer fremgangen vår nasjon har jobbet så hardt for å oppnå.<br/><br/>I fjor, i tilfelle av Shelby County v. Holder, den amerikanske Høyesterett sløyd en nøkkelkomponent i stemmerettsloven som muliggjorde tidligere føderal gjennomgang for å sikre ikke-diskriminering før noen ny stemmerettslov trådte i kraft.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Dessverre har responsen fra republikanske ledere vært å ikke gjøre noe. Sen. Ted Cruz og guvernør Rick Perry gikk ut av deres måte å rose Høyesteretts avgjørelse. Sen. Rand Paul avviste den fortsatte nødvendigheten av stemmerettsloven ved å merke seg: "Vi har en afroamerikansk president."<br/><br/>Selv om valget av president Barack Obama faktisk var en historisk milepæl, er det farlig å tro at det frikjenner oss fra å forbli årvåken mot de langvarige konsekvensene av vår nasjons fortid. Hastigheten som stater har flyttet for å vedta stemmebegrensninger, er en bekreftelse på at beskyttelsen som er innført av § 4, fortsatt er nødvendig.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Republikanske guvernører har signert strenge fotoidentifikasjonsrestriksjoner i loven som løsningen på et praktisk talt ikke-eksisterende problem med velgerutgaver, som uforholdsmessig skader kvinner, unge mennesker, arbeidsfamilier og det afroamerikanske samfunnet.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Spørsmål og svar: Vatikanets sikkerhetsekspert Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. juni 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Bilde: Australske jesuitter.<br/><br/>Presidenten for Senter for barnevern ved det gregorianske universitetet i Roma, og et medlem av den pavelige kommisjonen for beskyttelse av mindreårige, Hans Zollner SJ, var i Australia i 2018 for å snakke med katolske departementsledere og overlevende.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh fra Jesuit Communications satte seg ned med ham under besøket for å utforske hvordan Kirken reagerer på misbrukskrisen internasjonalt, og hva vi kan lære av våre erfaringer i Australia.<br/><br/>MM: Dette er din tredje tur til Australia. Du har besøkt ganske mange andre land for å se hvordan Kirken reagerer på overgrep rundt om i verden. Kan du gi oss en ide om hvordan det globale bildet ser ut?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Min forståelse, etter å ha besøkt rundt 50 land på fem eller seks kontinenter, er at Kirken virkelig begynner å bevege seg i løpet av de siste par årene når det gjelder å yte ofrene rettferdighet, lytte til dem og gjøre alt som kan gjøres for å beskytte dem.<br/><br/>Jeg var med jesuittene fra hele Afrika i slutten av april, og presidenten for jesuittenes assistans i Afrika og Madagaskar er veldig engasjert og dedikert til dette. Han har satt opp en grundig handlingsplan for formasjon og for å innføre retningslinjer overalt. Det er en veldig hensynsfull og veldig bevisst innsats for å gjøre alt som kan gjøres for å være proaktivt engasjert som jesuitter i Afrika - på et kontinent hvor inntil for noen år siden var alt dette et fremmedspråk.<br/><br/>En av utfordringene med å prøve å utvikle denne globale tilnærmingen er at du har å gjøre med så mange kulturer, og så mange forskjellige forståelser. Hvordan bringer du dette sammen og prøver å gi opplæring og støtte religiøse samfunn som takler disse problemene?<br/><br/>Dette er et av de store spørsmålene vi har. Jeg tror det jeg kan gjøre er å stimulere til diskusjon, stimulere til refleksjon og forberede folk så mye som mulig slik at de kan gjøre grunnarbeidet.<br/><br/>Senter for barnevern ved det gregorianske universitetet later ikke til å ha svar på alle spørsmål. Ikke bare fordi vi ikke kjenner de spesifikke sammenhengene – vi kjenner kanskje noen av dem, men vi snakker om tusenvis av kulturer, vi snakker om hundrevis av språk, vi snakker om svært forskjellige juridiske bakgrunner. Det varierer selv noen ganger innenfor ett land, for eksempel Australia hvor du har stater innenfor Commonwealth of Australia som har forskjellige lover enn andre stater.<br/><br/>Jeg er noen som prøver å fremkalle og stimulere diskusjon og refleksjon. Jeg er også veldig glad for å lytte til folk.<br/><br/>Du nevnte behovet for å lytte og støtte ofrene i å bli hørt. Vi har åpenbart hatt Royal Commission her i Australia, men hva er noen av de andre måtene du har sett at ofrenes stemmer blir støttet rundt om i verden?<br/><br/>I Frankrike er det et bispedømme som har etablert det de kaller "The Listening Space". Der kan ofrene komme frem og de kan uttrykke seg. Biskopen er til stede. Det er et åpent rom hvor folk som har blitt enormt såret er fri til i det minste å uttrykke hva de ønsker å be om fra Kirkens ledelse etc.<br/><br/>Det finnes andre steder i USA eller i andre land hvor ofre har blitt invitert av bispedømmer, av provinser, av Kirkens ledelse, til å stå fram. Jeg må si at generelt tror jeg det er en god vilje, og det er flere mennesker som biskoper og provinsielle som lytter til ofre enn vi vet. Men det finnes ingen modell for å gi ofrene ikke bare rom til å uttrykke seg og bli hørt, men også til å engasjere seg aktivt i Kirkens utvikling.<br/><br/>Når det gjelder å sette opp rom for støtte til ofre, hva er noen av tingene du har sett som virkelig kan hjelpe - og at vi kan vurdere her i Australia?<br/><br/>Et av de store poengene som mange ofre bringer opp er, "Kan vi ikke ha, i menighetsinnstillinger, i skoleinnstillinger, en vanlig samtale som foregår som inkluderer overlevende av misbruk som vanlige medlemmer av en komité, en kommisjon, et lydkort, en tilbakemeldingsgruppe eller noe sånt?" Slik at denne stemmen ikke bare bringes inn ved en bestemt anledning, eller hvor en person føler at han eller hun er på et tidspunkt for å kunne snakke ut om det, men [høres] regelmessig - bygge den stemmen inn i systemet.<br/><br/>Det vil hjelpe oss alle. Det vil hjelpe overlevende og ofre fordi de vil føle seg velkommen og verdsatt i den spesifikke opplevelsen, og i de spesifikke livsutfordringene, som de gikk gjennom. For det andre vil det hjelpe samfunnet som helhet, fordi vi i det minste kan gjøre oss mer og mer følsomme for hva de overlevendes bekymringer og spesifikke behov er - som også kan snakke med de unges behov.<br/><br/>M: Vi har sterke grupper av overlevende her i Australia som har vært i stand til å støtte hverandre gjennom denne prosessen. Men det du sier er at vi trenger en måte å støtte disse gruppene, og støtte disse menneskene, gjennom våre egne institusjoner også?<br/><br/>Og jeg tror vi må være kreative. Det vil fungere for en skole og et sogn og et bispedømme på en måte, og for andre på en annen måte. Fordi de overlevende som jeg er i konstant kontakt med, har ganske lignende forespørsler og lignende erfaringer med hensyn til å bli ønsket velkommen i kirken eller ikke - føler seg kastet ut eller avvist. Men de har også helt forskjellige forventninger til hverandre. Så jeg har lært at du også må være veldig imøtekommende i å akseptere forskjellene i hva denne bestemte gruppen, eller denne bestemte overlevende, ønsker, forespørsler og behov.<br/><br/>M: Overlevende snakker om å ønske å få historiene sine hørt og anerkjent. Vi har hatt Royal Commission her i Australia, som ga en uavhengig prosess der ofrene kunne komme frem. Er det behov for noe slikt i form av en sannhets-, rettferdighets- og forsoningsprosess for Kirken internasjonalt?<br/><br/>H: Ja, jeg tror det er et behov for det internasjonalt. Men jeg tror først at hver lokal menighet må gjøre sine egne lekser. Jeg ser ikke at det skjer veldig snart at et slikt råd eller kommisjon vil bli etablert for å se på dette området for hele Kirken. Kirken har et medlemskap på 1,3 milliarder mennesker, og er til stede i 190 land, med alle slags forskjeller i forventninger om psykologisk, åndelig og økonomisk støtte.<br/><br/>Det er en ting jeg har kommet over konsekvent i å kommunisere med, jobbe med og lytte til ofre, og det er at de ønsker å bli lyttet til. Så hvis det var følelsen av at ofrene stadig ble lyttet til - i Roma og andre steder - tror jeg det ville gi stor lettelse for mange ofre.<br/><br/>Jeg tror [Pave Francis'] bekymring, spesielt med hensyn til spørsmålet ditt, er at de lokale kirkene gjør alt de kan, slik at ofrene vil bli lyttet til i det aktuelle landet. Jeg har en liste over folk som ønsker å snakke med Den hellige far direkte, og fysisk er det umulig. Jeg var der i 2014 for å oversette for to tyske overlevende som ble valgt med to irske og to engelske overlevende da han fikk de seks av dem hjemme. Han tok hele morgenen å lytte til dem en etter en. Han var der i 40-45 minutter for hver eneste overlevende han ikke fikk sove.<br/><br/>Hans eksempel er å modellere for hele den katolske kirke hvordan ofre og overlevende blir mottatt, ønsket velkommen og lyttet til. Jeg tror at hvis biskopene og provinsielle i denne verden, i alle land, fulgte hans eksempel, ville mange overlevende virkelig sette pris på det.<br/><br/>Erkebiskop Diarmud Martin ble nylig sitert like før verdensmøtet for familier, om den pavelige kommisjonen, og sa at den er for liten som den for tiden er satt opp for å oppnå det den trenger for å oppnå. Hva er din oppfatning av det? Trenger kirken å bruke flere ressurser på hvordan den overvåker disse problemene?<br/><br/>For øyeblikket er vi 16 medlemmer fra stort sett alle kontinenter, og de store språkgruppene. Vi representerer en rekke disipliner og yrker, og formålet med kommisjonen - som de vedtekter som nettopp er blitt kunngjort stat - er å gi råd til Den hellige far.<br/><br/>En vanlig misforståelse om kommisjonen er først og fremst at vi behandler saker om beskyldninger. Det er ikke tilfelle. Vi har ingen juridisk eller administrativ makt i saker, fordi når det gjelder påstander om misbruk tribunaler og prosedyre er satt.<br/><br/>En annen misforståelse er at vi direkte fremmer ting på bakken. Vårt første og fremste mål er at vi gir råd til Den hellige far i saker.<br/><br/>Så fra mitt synspunkt, ja, vi trenger å investere mer. Men vi må investere mer på lokalt nivå, og vi må sørge for at forslagene fra den pavelige kommisjonen blir videresendt til Den hellige far - som normalt presidenten gjør - og så er det en oppfølgingsprosess som reflekterer det vi har gitt som vårt råd.<br/><br/>I Australia fører Catholic Professional Standards Limited tilsyn med Kirkens respons og gir retningslinjer og støtte for å sikre at alle institusjonene i Kirken er barnesikrede institusjoner. Er det behov for noen form for organisatorisk støtte fra Roma for de biskoper og bispedømmer som sliter med å danne disse institusjonene og gi beskyttelse i disse bispedømmene?<br/><br/>Jeg tror at kommisjonen til slutt vil utvikle seg i den linjen. De er nå i ferd med å ansette eksperter på disse områdene.<br/><br/>Jeg tror Kirken trenger å forstå at de lokale kirkene kan lære av hverandre gjensidig. Og min forståelse har alltid vært - og jeg tror Den hellige far har minnet oss - at Kirken ikke vil fungere som et sentralisert selskap. Det fungerer ikke slik, effektivt. Hver biskop, hver bispekonferanse, har til en viss grad sitt eget liv. Det vi trenger å lære mer om, er å åpne kanaler for gjensidig kommunikasjon.<br/><br/>Det er en rekke ting som folk klandrer for misbruk i Kirken. Som prest og psykolog, og som noen som har møtt og jobbet med overlevende, hva er dine tanker om det problemet?<br/><br/>Jeg tror spørsmålet om hvor misbruk kommer fra er det viktigste, og paven har adressert det i sitt brev til Guds folk publisert 20. august. Han sier i første ledd, og gjentar det igjen og igjen, at spørsmålet om seksuelt misbruk alltid er knyttet - eller nesten alltid knyttet - ikke bare til spørsmålet om maktmisbruk, men også til misbruk av samvittigheten.<br/><br/>Så det virkelige grunnleggende spørsmålet om misbruk er mye mer komplisert enn bare [spørsmålet om] seksualitet - enten det er heterofil eller homofil. Det er et maktspørsmål, og der må vi virkelig arbeide med spørsmålet om hvordan vi forstår prestedømmet, hvordan vi forstår biskopsskapet, hvordan vi forstår og lever ut våre tjenester?<br/><br/>Derfor er jeg veldig glad for at jesuittprovinsen i Australia etablerer en Code of Conduct. Fordi vi ikke snakker bare om seksuelt misbruk av mindreårige. Vi snakker om seksuelt misbruk av voksne, og vi snakker om misbruk på andre måter - som misbruk av samvittighet, hvor du dikterer til noen hva du tror, eller du later til å vite av Gud, og du kan fortelle en annen person, "Du må gjøre det", mot den personens samvittighet.<br/><br/>Mange tror at sølibat fører til overgrep. Som jeg alltid sier, er sølibat som sådan ikke årsak til misbruk - ellers hvordan forklarer vi at 99,9 prosent av alle misbrukere ikke lever et sølibatliv, og hvordan forklarer vi at 95 eller 96 prosent av alle prester ikke misbruker mindreårige? Men sølibat, eller et kyskhetsløfte, som egentlig ikke er integrert, som egentlig ikke leves ut ordentlig - ja, det produserer et problem. Noen ganger tar folk til å drikke, noen ganger tar de til gambling, og noen ganger tar de til seksuell misbruk, med voksne og med mindreårige.<br/><br/>Det virkelige spørsmålet om dette er hvordan vi skal forholde oss til forestillingen om religiøs åndelig kraft som prester og biskoper er utstyrt med? Hvordan kan teologi hjelpe oss med å forstå, og kanskje hvordan kan sosiologi, psykologi eller bedriftsadministrasjon hjelpe oss med å definere grensene for makt, og nødvendigheten av å holde grensene dine? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Jeg er ikke overrasket over denne mismatchen. Faktisk vil jeg til og med gå så langt som å si at dette ikke er noe som noen gang vil forandre seg, heller ikke bør vi alle bli dampet opp om å endre det. Om 10 år vil vi fortsatt ha blødende kant, komplekse elementer i den største bekymringslisten, og de tingene vi endelig kommer rundt for å forstå, vil være de store delene av utgiftene våre.<br/><br/>Nå har Gunnar og Andy begge gode poeng, spesielt om at IT-team ser IT-problemer og løser dem med IT-løsninger; Faktisk er jeg positiv til at poengene deres holder fortjeneste.<br/><br/>Men jeg tror det er andre ideer som trumfer dem (jeg kommenterte på bloggene sine om det, og senere bestemte jeg meg for at jeg bare skulle blogge her). De topp 3 bekymringene er blødende nye slik at:<br/><br/>Vi frykter nye ting fordi vi ikke forstår dem, eller ikke forstår dem fordi de er nye.<br/><br/>De er for nye for oss til å ha solide tilnærminger til å håndtere dem.<br/><br/>de er for nye for oss å vite om vi skal være bekymret eller ikke! vi har en tendens til å standard til paranoid / bekymret, noe som er bra!<br/><br/>for ny til å ha åpenbare budsjettelementer som er tildelt dem. Kan jeg kjøpe en boks eller noe programvare som gir "skysikkerhet" eller "sikkerhet for sosiale medier?"<br/><br/>de er så nye virksomheten vet ikke engang hvordan de skal bruke dem eller hva de vil ha ut av dem. Enda mindre hvordan vi kan sikre dem mens de fortsatt møter eller i det minste ikke tramper over alle forretningsbehov. Hvis virksomheten ikke engang vet hvordan de skal bruke dem ennå, er jeg ikke sikker på at sikkerheten er i noen posisjon til å veilede den bruken sikkert.<br/><br/>Det bør også nevnes at disse nye tingene i stor grad blir presset via forbrukerland og inn i virksomheten, med IT som en slags, "Oh yeah," tenkte brannmurer, AV, AM, Auth er alle IT-responser på typiske IT-problemer. Selvfølgelig er det en forskjell der. De er også veldig subjektive problemer, i motsetning til svært objektive elementer som brannmurer, kjente ondsinnede biter, atferd, signaturer, porter. Virksomheten presenterer svært komplekse problemer som ofte involverer mennesker (som vi ikke kan lappe) og som ofte ikke passer pent inn i tepperegler. Selv om vi vendte oss bort fra tekniske løsninger og viet vår tid til å løse disse problemene, kommer de fortsatt ikke til å bli løst pent. På samme måte, når push kommer til å skyve, kan du ha og møte mål med brannmurer? Kan du vise forbedring? Alt dette strømmer fra det heller subjektive ikke-tekniske aspektet av disse problemene. Typen av forskjellen mellom et barns rapportkort og tilbakemeldingen du får fra en foreldre-lærerkonferanse. Hvis du har et barn, hvilken ville du være mest tilbøyelig til å være uenig med eller ikke nødvendigvis tro på? (Svaret er det subjektive!)<br/><br/>Det kan sies at dette er den naturlige progresjonen av sikkerhet og teknologi: fra å forkorte de tekniske kontrollene til å flytte opp stakken mot atferd og mennesker. Jada, disse 3 beste bekymringene kan sies å slå gjennom brannmurer og nettverkssegmenter, men det er arten av disse tingene (sosiale medier "punching" gjennom en brannmur er langt annerledes enn meg å slå gjennom en SSH-tilkobling for å bygge bro over hjemmenettverket mitt; sosiale medier er beslektet med * måte * Jeg bruker min SSH-tilkobling etter at holdet allerede er slått fordi det er nødvendig; dvs. sosiale medier er porten<br/><br/>I utgangspunktet peker alle indikasjoner på ikke å bli overrasket over denne dikotomien. Og jeg tror ikke dette er noen ytterligere indikasjon på at IT / sikkerhet gjør det galt, eller ikke er riktig justert med virksomheten, eller har en teknisk mørk serverrombakgrunn. Jeg sier ikke at vi gjør ting riktig eller at vi er riktig justert, men ovenstående er ikke et godt argument for å støtte teorien om disse manglene.<br/><br/>Nå for et virkelig stort hopp. Jeg vil sammenligne den nåværende økningen i mobil databehandling for å være så stor som introduksjonen av datamaskiner i virksomheten og senere PC / internett i virksomheten. Nå var jeg ikke rundt da førstnevnte skjedde, og jeg var heller ikke i bransjen da den personlige datamaskinrevolusjonen feide inn i virksomheten, men jeg vil vedde på at det er den nærmeste sammenligningen så langt. Jeg kan til og med si det samme for sosiale medier. Disse er forbannet nye, og de er store endringer utover bare å bringe inn Macs eller ny programvare eller noen ny forretningsprosess. |
