| Sleep Clinic<br/><br/>The sleep disorders program evaluates and treats children and adults affected by sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, parasomnias and night time enuresis. The residents see patients during sleep disorders clinic hours.<br/><br/>During this rotation, the residents are exposed to a wide variety of sleep disorders. They are trained to investigate and evaluate their own patient care experiences pertaining to sleep evaluations with appraisal and assimilation of current scientific evidence. The residents work closely with sleep disorder faculty physicians and acquire the skills to formulate and communicate with patients and families about their diagnostic assessment and management plan, including neuropharmacology. Providing care plans to other physicians and care providers either verbally or via letter/note is an integral part of the program. | Søvnklinikk<br/><br/>Søvnforstyrrelsesprogrammet evaluerer og behandler barn og voksne som er rammet av søvnrelaterte problemer som søvnløshet, søvnapné, narkolepsi og andre hypersomnier, parasomnier og nattlig enurese. Beboerne ser pasienter under søvnforstyrrelser klinikk timer.<br/><br/>Under denne rotasjonen blir beboerne utsatt for et bredt spekter av søvnforstyrrelser. De er opplært til å undersøke og evaluere sine egne pasientpleieopplevelser knyttet til søvnevalueringer med vurdering og assimilering av dagens vitenskapelige bevis. Beboerne jobber tett med søvnforstyrrelsesfakultetets leger og tilegner seg ferdighetene til å formulere og kommunisere med pasienter og familier om deres diagnostiske vurderings- og styringsplan, inkludert nevrofarmakologi. Å gi omsorgsplaner til andre leger og omsorgsleverandører enten muntlig eller via brev / notat er en integrert del av programmet. |
| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Virkelig Handsfree Bluetooth Headset tar talekommandoer<br/><br/>De fleste Bluetooth-hodetelefoner er helt i stand til taleoppringing ting, forutsatt at den tilkoblede mobiltelefonen kan gjøre det, men BlueAnt V1 tar talekontroll til en ny høyde. Det utrolig kompakte Bluetooth-headsettet markedsføres som det første noensinne med et ekte stemmebasert brukergrensesnitt.<br/><br/>I stedet for å klikke på en fysisk knapp for å svare på anropene dine, snakker du bare inn i mikrofonen og sier "aksepter anrop". Andre grunnleggende talekommandoer kan inkludere "volum opp", "avvis anrop" eller "gjør klesvasken". Ok, kanskje det ikke vil gjøre det siste, men du kan se hvordan en helt handsfree-opplevelse som den som tilbys av BlueAnt V1 kan være utmerket for sjåfører og andre som trenger hendene sine. Det er derfor du bruker et Bluetooth-headset i utgangspunktet.<br/><br/>Ulempen er at stemmekontrollen kan være "wonky", og det kan være ganske frustrerende når du ved et uhell gir den en kommando som du ikke vil at den skal gjøre. Hva skjer hvis du er i en samtale med noen, og du tilfeldigvis sier "slutt samtale"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | onsdag, juli 06, 2005<br/><br/>Skal du på college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Her er en annen flott artikkel om vårt sviktende (og stadig mer latterlige) innvandringssystem, denne gangen fra Boston Globe. En 18 år gammel uokumentert innvandrer fra Massachusetts ble tildelt et fireårig stipend ved ethvert statlig universitet på grunn av hennes høye testresultater, men dette ble senere oppsagt når statlige tjenestemenn fant ut om hennes innvandringsstatus. Som forfatteren av artikkelen så med rette sier,<br/><br/>"Så mye for å feire byggesteinene for suksess og den amerikanske drømmen. Romney sier, tøff flaks hvis du er smart, hardtarbeidende, og barn av ulovlige innvandrere."<br/><br/>Det er utenfor meg hvorfor noen ønsker å holde smarte, høyt oppnådde barn som denne ut av college. Tror noen virkelig at å nekte statlig undervisning og stipend til udokumenterte innvandrere vil få potensielle innvandrere til å tenke to ganger om å komme hit for å jobbe? Eller er politikk som disse motivert av frykt? Til tross for den stadig mer utbredte bevegelsen til fordel for DREAM Act og statlige lover (se dette forrige innlegget) for å tillate udokumenterte studenter å betale i-statlig undervisning, ser det ut til at fryktens kraft vokser.<br/><br/>Det er interessant at Mass. Gov. Romney er bashing udokumenterte innvandrere nå - denne artikkelen i Economist viser hvordan hans kampanje for å avslutte homofile ekteskap i Massachusetts er nært knyttet til hans forventede løp for presidentskapet i 2008. Her i New York har den antatte demokratiske frontrunneren Hillary Clinton gått til høyre om innvandring, og hevder at hun er "adamantly mot ulovlige innvandrere." Det er uheldig at måten å komme videre i politikken (spesielt i de røde statene) er å klandre innvandrere for våre problemer. Det vil være interessant å se om en økt Latino-deltakelse på steder som Sørvest vil bevise Hillary feil.<br/><br/>3 kommentarer:<br/><br/>Kanskje folk ikke vil at ulovlige aliens skal få stipend av følgende grunner:<br/><br/>1. Foreldrene deres brøt loven for å komme inn i landet. 2. Foreldrene deres måtte stjele noens identitet for å jobbe i dette landet. 3. Foreldrene deres må jukse på inntektsskatten (og andre skatter) for å bo her. 4. Foreldrene deres måtte lyve for å få barna sine innlagt. 5. foreldrene deres løy om søknader om ting som gratis lunsj.<br/><br/>For det første avgjorde Høyesterett i 1982 at alle barn har rett til offentlig utdanning uavhengig av innvandringsstatus. Skoler er forbudt å spørre om et barns innvandringsstatus, noe som betyr at udokumenterte foreldre ikke trenger å "lyve" for å få barna sine gratis lunsj.<br/><br/>For det andre trenger ikke mange innvandrere å bruke en annen identitet eller jukse på inntektsskatt for å jobbe her - mange arbeidsgivere ansetter bevisst udokumenterte innvandrere (dette har skjedd i noen tid - 1986 IMM. Reform- og kontrolllovens forsøk på å håndtere det, og mange anti-innvandrerforesatte argumenterer for at arbeidsgiversanksjoner må styrkes i dag) og ganske mange innvandrere betaler inntektsskatt og andre skatter som de aldri ender opp med å motta fordelene med (New York Times rapporterte at ulovlige innvandrere gir sosial sikkerhet med et tilskudd på $ 7 milliarder i året).<br/><br/>Til slutt, hvis det største problemet med udokumenterte innvandrere er at de bryter loven ved å være her, bør den samme standarden brukes på bedrifter som bevisst ansetter dem (som forresten også er mot loven selv om det sjelden håndheves)? Skal barna til disse forretningsfolkene nektes de samme mulighetene fordi foreldrene deres brøt loven? Kan vi utvide dette argumentet til barna til alle som noen gang har brutt loven i dette landet?<br/><br/>Uansett hva du mener om ulovlig innvandring, er poenget at barna ikke skal straffes for foreldrenes beslutninger om å komme hit. Spesielt når disse lyse og hardtarbeidende udokumenterte studentene har potensial til å bidra så mye til samfunnet vårt. |
| this states that it was the Flu during the PO's and while I know that teams mask/hide injuries, this one wasn't bad at all considering he missed 1 game during the PO's.<br/><br/>You may have this injury mixed up with someone else.<br/><br/>Yea...sure "flu"..and Thornton had flu too. I don't know if you watched playoffs but it was indeed concussion...I sure did. he was hit pretty hard by Begin and wasn't the same after this. He was laying on the ice for quite a while and didn't play the next game | Dette sier at det var influensa under PO-ene, og mens jeg vet at lag maskerer / skjuler skader, var denne ikke dårlig i det hele tatt med tanke på at han savnet 1 kamp under PO-ene.<br/><br/>Du kan ha denne skaden blandet opp med noen andre.<br/><br/>Ja... sikkert "influensa".. og Thornton hadde influensa også. Jeg vet ikke om du så playoffs, men det var faktisk hjernerystelse... Jeg gjorde det. han ble truffet ganske hardt av Begin og var ikke det samme etter dette. Han lå på isen en stund og spilte ikke neste kamp. |
| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay.

Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.

It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Selskaper er ikke mennesker og penger er ikke tale<br/><br/>I Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, den amerikanske Høyesterett veltet århundre gamle restriksjoner på bedriftens utgifter i valg under dekke av å beskytte First Amendment ytringsfrihet. Dommer Anthony M. Kennedy, skriver for flertallet, sa: "Hvis First Amendment har noen kraft, forbyr det kongressen å bøtelegge eller fengsle borgere, eller foreninger av borgere, for bare å engasjere seg i politisk tale." Dette argumentet for flertallsbeslutningen hviler på forestillingen om at selskaper er dekket av de samme ytringsfrihetsbeskyttelsene som individuelle borgere, og at kampanjedonasjoner eller finansiering er det samme som tale.<br/><br/>Selskaper er imidlertid iboende ikke det samme som enkeltpersoner og kan derfor ikke ha samme beskyttelse som enkeltpersoner. Det er en rekke lover som beskytter selskaper og deres interesser på arenaen de per definisjon er dannet for - nemlig markedsplassen. Lovene som styrer selskaper og rettighetene de nyter, er forskjellige fra lovene og rettighetene til enkeltpersoner. Et selskap, for eksempel, kan inngå kontrakter som et individ, men i motsetning til et individ, kan et selskaps medlemmer være beskyttet av begrenset ansvar, slik at deres personlige eiendeler ikke står på spill.<br/><br/>Hvis et selskap er en egen juridisk enhet som styres av andre lover enn en person, er selskaper ikke beskyttet under første endring på samme måte som enkeltpersoner er beskyttet. Bedrifter, spesielt i deres mektigste og rikeste inkarnasjoner, er eksponentielt mer innflytelsesrike enn de fleste individer i Amerika. Restriksjonene på bedriftens utgifter i valg som ble veltet av USAs høyesterett, var ment å rette opp denne maktbalansen mellom gjennomsnittlige individer og urimelig innflytelsesrike bedrifter. Selskaper har allerede en mengde måter å påvirke politikken på, fra politiske aksjonskomiteer til lobbyister på Capitol Hill. De som utformet Bill of Rights ønsket å beskytte stemmene til de trampede, ikke forsterke stemmene til eliten.<br/><br/>Den andre delen av Høyesteretts premiss for sin beslutning er at First Amendment-klausulen gjelder for kampanjefinansiering. Mens tale kan tolkes løst som enhver form for uttrykk, ville en slik åpen, tvetydig definisjon skape et mylder av problemer med alle slags lover. En arkitekt har en visjon om en bygning: det er hans kunst, hans selvuttrykk, men han kan ikke ignorere lokale reguleringslover som for eksempel begrenser høyden på bygningen hans. Skal han saksøke staten for brudd på hans ytringsfrihet, hans rett til å uttrykke seg? Likestilling av penger med tale åpner også døren for ulike latterlige krav fra for eksempel en arbeidsgiver som motsetter seg minstelønnslover siden han ønsker å uttrykke at hans ansatte bare er verdt å betale $ 3 i timen. Det må være restriksjoner på hva som utgjør tale for å forhindre en bastardisering av begrepet og en altfor liberal tolkning av første endring.<br/><br/>Et selskap har allerede makt til å utstede en uttalelse til fordel for en kandidat eller politikk gjennom sine politiske handlingskomiteer, og enkelte medlemmer av en bedrift er velkommen til å bidra med penger også. Men å tillate et selskap å bruke sin enorme fortjeneste til å finansiere valget direkte eller for å fjerne en kandidat, kompromitterer den demokratiske oppfatningen av et fritt og rettferdig valg. Det er usømmelige bånd selv nå mellom politikere og ulike næringer, men denne nye avgjørelsen vil gjøre slike forbindelser mer robuste og gi dem en finér av legitimitet. En politiker finansiert av en bedrift ville bli helt holdt til sin politiske agenda og ikke til velgerne.<br/><br/>Det er ikke bare uavhengigheten til politikere som står på spill, men også uavhengigheten til våre dommere, som i det minste forventes å være upartiske. Mange stater bruker fortsatt valg for å utnevne dommere, noe som gjør dem sårbare for påvirkning av politiske utgifter. I en nylig tale på en lovskolekonferanse bekymret tidligere høyesterettsdommer Sandra Day O'Connor om virkningen av bedriftskampanjefinansiering i rettsvalg, og sa at "judiciell kampanje gjør forrige ukes beslutning i Citizens United et økende problem for å opprettholde et uavhengig rettsvesen."<br/><br/>To hjørnesteiner i vårt demokrati – frie valg og et uavhengig rettsvesen – er truet av Høyesteretts aktivist- og innblandingsbeslutning. Saken kunne ha blitt avgjort mye mer snevert i favør av Citizens United, men i stedet bestemte flertallet av dommerne seg for å utvide saken for å kjempe for rettighetene til store penger over interessene til det amerikanske folket. Senatorer Dick Durbin (D-IL) og Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduserte Fair Elections Now Act i mars i fjor. Det ville forby bidrag fra politiske handlingskomiteer og ville matche individuelle donasjoner, begrenset til $ 100, på en 4:1 basis, slik at innsamlingen fokuserer på folket. Et slikt system har vært på plass i New York City siden 1988 Campaign Finance Act. Resten av landet er lenge for sent å følge. Aldri før har kampen for offentlig finansiering vært mer nødvendig.<br/><br/>Forfatteren er en Columbia College junior med hovedfag i statsvitenskap. Hun er en potensiell jusstudent.<br/><br/>Den 14. endringen, som var en av de rekonstruksjonsendringene som ble lagt til etter den nordlige aggresjonskrigen, ble aldri lovlig ratifisert av statene og har forårsaket flere problemer enn alle de andre etterkrigsendringene kombinert. Hvis min hukommelse tjener meg riktig, ble selskaper erklært av Høyesterett for å være 14th Amendment-borgere i løpet av slutten av 1800-tallet eller begynnelsen av 1900-tallet. I tilfelle du ikke er kjent med ordlyden i denne endringen, gjorde det i utgangspunktet alle en borger (og emne) i USA. Før krigen var alle individer borgere av staten der de bodde, og ingen var statsborger av USA, og de var heller ikke underlagt jurisdiksjonen til USA, bortsett fra de som bodde i District of Columbia eller bodde i et av territoriene under jurisdiksjonen til USA. Hovedformålet med den nordlige aggresjonskrigen var å ødelegge suvereniteten til de enkelte stater og redusere statusen til hver amerikaner til et emne under kontroll og jurisdiksjon av USAs regjering. Grunnleggerne satte opp vår regjering som en løs konføderasjon av suverene stater med statene som utøver all meningsfylt politisk makt. De investerte aldri eller hadde til hensikt at noen effektiv politisk makt skulle bo i Washington. Ting vil bare bli mye verre før vi folket kaster tyvene og pengevekslerne ut av Washington og gjenoppretter vår regjering tilbake til det den en gang var.<br/><br/>Ordet person betyr selskap i loven. Det er ikke at selskaper ikke er mennesker, det er at folk ikke er selskaper. Vi har blitt lurt til å akseptere en bedriftsidentitet[ALL CAPS]. Se på førerkortet ditt. Hver gang vi går til retten, går vi som et selskap, ikke som en naturlig person. De første selskapene var regjeringer. Ser på logisk, begrenset ansvar for et selskap er utvidelsen av suveren immunitet til kongen etter at han ikke lenger var konge. De samme herskende elitefamiliene er fortsatt i kontroll, og det går helt tilbake til den første kjente om utenomjordiske [anunaki] som de sumeriske dokumentene snakker om. Den samme gruppen tar også æren eller skylden for alle religioner og hemmelige samfunn.<br/><br/>- Spiller det noen rolle? Tenk på det, hele Kongressen og Senatet er et hundeshow, de virkelige maktmeglerne som kontrollerer det hele er i skyggene, jobber med avtalene, gjør hva de vil, med AL-CIA-DA og MOSSAD der ute som dreper alle som er uenige med disse skyggeregjeringens drittsekker som virkelig driver alt.<br/><br/>Hvorfor er det så viktig å være opprørt over dette? Etter mer enn to hundre år med absolutt bevis på at politikerne bare er et fancy hånddukkeshow for å distrahere oss fra det virkelige hjulet og handelen i bakrommene andre steder, hvorfor spiller det noen rolle nå at den totale forakt for demokrati blir demonstrert av SCOTUS i denne dommen? Idiotene i denne retten vet at de virkelige gutta med hendene på makt spakene i systemet ikke er i Kongressen og Senatet.<br/><br/>Da rettsstaten ble obsolet i verden, generelt, og alt ble mer eller mindre ROLLERBALL bare denne gangen, på STEROIDS, for og av korporasjonene, hvorfor gjorde denne ene regelen så mye forskjell? Hvorfor tror alle dere rasshøl at denne "lagging" indikatoren på slutten av enhver form for demokratisk regjering gjør noen forskjell.<br/><br/>Hypotetisk sett, la oss si at denne avgjørelsen ikke hadde skjedd. Tror noen av dere at selskapene og de monetære innflytelsene i skyggene ikke ville ha fortsatt å utøve noen og all sin vilje på resten av oss?<br/><br/>For de av dere som tror det hadde vært annerledes, foreslår jeg at du finner et middel til din TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Denne avgjørelsen gjorde ingen forskjell. Det var alltid slik, lenge før SCOTUS i utgangspunktet sa til selskaper: "Gå videre, gjør hva faen du vil ... de små menneskene er bare kanonføde for krigene dine, chattel for deg å bytte og selge på fritiden. "<br/><br/>Demokrati har alltid vært en illusjon. Vi har aldri hatt noen kontroll, noensinne. Å lage et slikt fjell ut av denne moldvarphøyden er helt uberettiget, i lys av det faktum at for hele 230 års historien til denne republikken, trengte de feite kattene og de rike oligarkene aldri noen kongress eller senat for å gjøre det de likte, under noen omstendigheter, noensinne. De bare gjorde det.<br/><br/>Regjeringen du så på var en kimære, ikke ekte.<br/><br/>Jo før dere alle kommer til den erkjennelsen, jo før kan vi komme videre med mindre pissing og stønn over en ren spøk av en tekniskhet som alltid var tilfelle fra dag en, og ble ikke påtvunget oss av SCOTUS, retten bare ganske sent erklærte for oss hva som har skjedd i lang lang lang lang, korrupt tid.<br/><br/>Jeg har en gal forelskelse på Exxon, og Exxon har en på meg, bryllup klokker i våren - litt rask jeg vet, men vår kjærlighet kan ikke nektes. Exxon er litt sjenert, så ikke forvent noen offentlige kunngjøringer, vi tenker på et stille bryllup i Reno.<br/><br/>Enhver bedrift er rett og slett en gruppe individer (små eller store) som utøver sine individuelle rettigheter kollektivt. Derfor har enhver bedrift de samme rettighetene som disse individene (bortsett fra selvfølgelig stemmeretten, som er forbeholdt individene selv). Friheten til å avhende ens rikdom som man ser passende, kommer sammen med friheten til å tjene den. Hvis et aggregat av enkeltpersoner har tjent penger, bør det være fritt til å bestemme hvordan de skal avhende pengene. Det virkelige problemet er ikke at bedrifter kan donere til kampanjer, det er at regjeringen har fått lov til å blande seg inn i virksomheten - det vil si at regjeringen kan gi noen tjeneste i retur for de pengene. Vi trenger atskillelse av handel og stat på samme måte og av samme grunner som vi har atskillelse av kirke og stat. Jeg synes også det er interessant at forfatteren som eksempler valgte to lover (soneinndeling og minstelønn) som også krenker individuelle rettigheter. Den første krenker eiendomsretten, og den andre krenker enkeltpersoners rett til å inngå kontrakter fritt.<br/><br/>Under din jackoffian analyse, bør ingen forstyrre noe noen gjør i det hele tatt. Si, hvis jeg var i en folkemengde, med en lørdag kveld spesiell, og jeg ønsker å "ytringsfrihet" rumpa med det mye på samme måte som CIA frigjort Bobby Kennedy i L.A. en kveld, det er greit, fordi å forstyrre meg er å forstyrre min rett til ytringsfrihet du.<br/><br/>Du tror at det ikke er noen samfunnsmessig rolle for noen rettsstat, at alt som passer inn under "ender rettferdiggjør midler" rasjonalitet bør aldri bli forstyrret, bare la alle gjøre hva de vil, og det hele fungerer. At Ayn Rand-tullet ikke virker, det virker helt opp til det punktet hvor noen andre betaler en pris for din "hva enn jeg vil" frihet krysser en grense og så forstyrrer min frihet.<br/><br/>regler og lover bør eksistere innenfor rammen av samfunnet strengt for å holde i sjakk at gode gamle "Jeg kan gjøre hva jeg vil, og det er bare meg å være fri" linje med hest dritt.<br/><br/>Selskaper har ingen rettigheter, dorkus! Globalt har de vært grunnen til at det er så mange mislykkede stater, plyndret av viljen til korporatokrater basert i USA som tror at ytringsfriheten deres oversetter til; "gjør det vi forteller deg, eller vi vil bombe deg for å få ressursene vi trenger" slags voldtekt og plyndring.<br/><br/>En dag håper jeg at et rasshøl kødder med deg med ytringsfriheten sin, og så hører vi at du klager over at loven svikter deg. I din libertarianske verden av "Jeg kan gjøre hva jeg vil", er den eneste rettsstaten du gjør opp for å rettferdiggjøre ditt endelige mål. For deg da, vil det være morsomt å se hvordan du takler noen andre drittsekkers tolkning av at grensen din bare er litt av en ren ulempe for sine mål, som ikke nødvendigvis respekterte grensene dine i det hele tatt, for pokker!<br/><br/>Noen ved navn "uh huh, riktig .." kan ha et logisk poeng skjult i skogen av navn-kalling og halm-mann misbruk, men hva med dette: Selskaper er oppfinnelser av staten som er opprettet for å passere noen av risikoen for å gjøre forretninger fra folk som driver virksomheten over til aksjonærene (hvis noen), kundene (hvis noen) og publikum. Så hvis et selskap begår en svindel, er det selskapet som er straffet (vanligvis) og bøtelagt, og folkene som driver selskapet får gå bort med et gyldent håndtrykk. Og kostnaden for boten blir sendt videre til kundene og betalt til regjeringen (ikke ofrene!). Til "David"s poeng, hvis vi skulle skille regjering og handel, ville selskaper opphøre å eksistere! Ikke en dårlig idé.<br/><br/>Jeg tror poenget er at hvis et selskap begår en økonomisk forbrytelse, og ingen legger merke til det (hvis treet faller i skogen og ingen hører det, gjorde det virkelig et støyargument) så fant en forbrytelse faktisk sted?<br/><br/>og i et veitch-diagram, hvor de to blokkene kolliderer og samhandler, hvis den ene krenker den andres grense, hvem er dommeren for hvem som ble krenket?<br/><br/>Mitt poeng er dette: det er ingen stråmann argumenter med hensyn til Davids asinine vurdering at selskaper kan gjøre hva de vil med forlatelse. Sannheten i saken er å gi selskaper og oligarker, eller hvem som helst, en lisens til å gjøre hva de vil, når de vil, under forutsetning av at DE ER INDIVIDUELLE og dermed, garantert FRI SPRÅK, er både absurd og hestemøkk.<br/><br/>selskaper består av grupper av mennesker. folk som skal leve etter noen skinn av rettssikkerhet. Når de ikke trenger å, så er det "Jeg kan gjøre hva jeg vil så lenge ingen fanger meg eller holder meg ansvarlig for mine overtredelser" som skjer her.<br/><br/>Hvis det er den verden David vil leve i, så la ham dra dit og få det til å skje, men for pokker, ikke forvent at jeg ikke protesterer mot den dritten!<br/><br/>Vi kan alle komme overens, så lenge grensene ikke blir krenket etter behag av noen som tror at deres rett til å gjøre det de vil, faktisk opphever min rett til ikke å bli forstyrret av deres handlinger.<br/><br/>Når det gjelder selskaper, har de ingen rett til å krenke mine rettigheter, eller dine, eller noen andres. Hvis de ikke kan fungere i samfunnet som en velvillig og dermed ikke forstyrrende enhet, har de ingen rett til å eksistere.<br/><br/>og David ble ikke truet. Han er et rasshøl for å hevde at "gjør hva du vil, det er ytringsfrihet" er en haug med hestemøkk. Det er la la la land bullshit. Og jeg protesterer mot noen eller noe som bryter mine grenser med den ytringsfriheten. Det er noe dritt, og det vet du at det er!<br/><br/>Vel, det var et fargerikt svar. Dessverre, "uh-uh", du er langt fra merket. Jeg sa aldri at folk har rett til å krenke andres rettigheter... og jeg avviser "endene rettferdiggjør midlene" tenkning. Ja, lover skal eksistere, men KUN for å beskytte rettighetene til mennesker. Jeg beklager at du har en så forvrengt og fryktelig feil syn på mitt argument.<br/><br/>Jeg ber om unnskyldning for at jeg tisset i maisflakene dine. Jeg tror jeg trodde du konkluderte med at selskaper var i stand til å gjøre hva de ville under denne retten til ytringsfrihet, som i Amerk'a er en vits i dag fordi PATRIOT ACT og en ikke-erklært tilstand av MARTIAL Law vi har levd under siden september 2001, har gitt regjeringen muligheten til å suspendere og eller "skjære" den amerikanske grunnloven og Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>dessverre, folk har bare noen få rettigheter. vi har rett til å bli beskattet til det punktet av absurditet. vi har rett til å bli vernepliktig og bli kanonføde for oligark kriger. og vi har rett til å holde kjeft og være stille mens vi blir gledet av selskaper og oligarker og bankfolk. det er våre rettigheter, og dessverre, de virkelig SUCKETH, David. Jeg tror vi kan være enige om det!<br/><br/>Jeg lurer fortsatt på hvordan nybegynner, Roberts, arvet Chief Justiceship etter Rhenquist i stedet for at rollen går til noen med mer erfaring på benken. Hva planlegger "Roberts Court" å gjøre neste, skjønt, for selskaper? Gi dem rett til å stemme på meningsmålingene som ekte mennesker?; kanskje har stemmer av mennesker talt som 3/5 av en person eller mindre til deres 1?<br/><br/>Jeg har ikke lest hele den 183-siders boklengden "herskende" ennå, men finner disse forferdelige uttalelsene deri å være ikke bare i strid med deres ekspansive handlinger i dette tilfellet, men også noe av en abdikasjon av sin plikt:<br/><br/>Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., konkurrerende). Fordi innsatsen er så høy, er vår standard praksis å avstå fra å ta opp konstitusjonelle spørsmål unntatt når det er nødvendig for å avgjøre om bestemte krav foran oss. Se Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). Denne politikken ligger både til grunn for vår vilje til å tolke tvetydige vedtekter for å unngå konstitusjonelle problemer og vår praksis «aldri å formulere en regel i konstitusjonell lov bredere enn det som kreves av de presise fakta som den skal anvendes på». USA v. Raines, 362<br/>U.S. 17, 21 (1960) (siterer Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. kommissærer for emigrasjon, 113<br/>U.S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>Flertallet og dissens er forent i å uttrykke troskap til disse prinsippene. Ante, på 12; post, på 14 (STEVENS, J., konkurrerer delvis og dissens delvis). >><br/><br/>Roberts, i kraft av sine løgner under Confirmation av DEMS som dyttet sin liggende ræv gjennom prosessen med mach hastighet, må bli "stilt for retten" for å være en jævla løgner. Han sa spesifikt at han ikke ville gå denne ruten for å skrive beslutninger som ikke er basert på avgjorte, ikke-kontroversielle konsepter i den amerikanske grunnloven ... og her har han tydeligvis gjort akkurat det motsatte av det.<br/><br/>Den virkelige skylden bør være på skuldrene til kuksugerne i SENATE som bekreftet jævelen i utgangspunktet, og sa at de ikke ville stemme mot hans bekreftelse fordi de lagret sin ammunisjon for ekte trusler mot oss.<br/><br/>Jeg klandrer de jævla DINOKRATER mer enn jeg klandrer den løgnaktige haugen med dritt som heter Roberts, drittsekker som SCHUMER og den andre drittsekken fra Illinois, og den løgnaktige sionistiske jævelen Levin fra Michigan. Bare et par av dem kunne ha stoppet bekreftelsen av Alito, og så Roberts, men de lot det gli.<br/><br/>Påstanden om at alt dette faktisk er vindusdressing er riktig, og sannheten er, selv om det er et åpenbart brudd på våre rettigheter over hele linja, er disse avskummene i SCOTUS bare postfakta, og hevder skruen de gjorde mot oss i lang, lang, lang tid.<br/><br/>Sannheten er at det aldri spilte noen rolle hva vi trodde skjedde, fordi selskaper har fungert godt utenfor loven i lang tid nå, og ingen har holdt dem ansvarlige. Selv de bastardene som sitter på SCOTUS er velgjørere av urett og grådighet av selskapene som gir tilbakeslag til dem for sine beslutninger, i form av lagerutbytte.<br/><br/>dessverre, å fokusere på den korrupte SCOTUS hjelper oss ikke mye. Det er som å si det åpenbare, og forventer at det skal være straffbart, når det ikke er.<br/><br/>Vi er rævkjørt uansett hvordan vi ser på det, men det vil bli en forsoningsdag. Når de tar bort hver siste rest av personlig verdighet av hele middelklassen i dette landet, vil det være helvete å betale. Det vil bli en voldelig, blodig tilbakeslag som bare har blitt sett i Frankrike, men til slutt vil komme hjem for å rooste her.<br/><br/>Kommunister har lenge vært i bransjen for å fremme klassekrig langs økonomiske linjer og parenteser. Prøv å tenke mer i form av den konstitusjonelle klassen enn "middelklassen" som deres lingvister foretrekker. Fungerer bedre, imo, for å kaste dem av sine gameplans.<br/><br/>Det som skjer nå er en levendegjøring i Sheeples erkjennelse av at noe er alvorlig galt, og at fasaden og illusjonen slites tynn og faller ned, og avslører det stygge, multitentaklede ROTHSCHILD-dyret bak korporatokratiet presser på for mer makt og absolutt styre.<br/><br/>som "middelklassen" eller hva du vil kalle det, blir stadig desimert og ødelagt, til slutt nok Sheeple vil ha våknet til det punktet der de innser at det er enten stå opp og kjempe eller dø på alle fire.<br/><br/>systemet ROTHSCHILDS kollapser inn i seg selv, på grunn av altfor mye ute av kontroll, ukontrollert GREED, og nå er det som en høy bygning som går frem og tilbake som en pendel i et jordskjelv, på et tidspunkt vil det til slutt "snap" og falle. Vi er i sluttspillet, som du vil, av demokrati og det falske økonomiske systemet som ble begått på alle, så det er en kollisjon med VIRKELIGHET om å skje ganske snart, og det vil ikke være pent.<br/><br/>Hvis jeg var SCOTUS, ville jeg sørget for at de biz-jetflyene er drevet, piloter som står ved, for deres siste PARAGUAYAN-tur til Bush-komplekset hvor de vil gjemme seg når ballongen endelig går opp her.<br/><br/>men i økende grad ser det ut til at de presser hardt for tredje verdenskrig for å ta alles øyne av tankene som blåser, utrolig HUBRIS av deres ilk.<br/><br/>En regnskapets dag er nær, og den blir ikke vakker.<br/><br/>Kommentar av hva jeg tror skjer nå er dette.. &#124;<br/>2. februar 2010<br/>&#124; Svare<br/><br/>Jeg er enig i at kollapssystemene er deres, ikke USAs, og sjekk ut denne lenken fra Rense.com:<br/><br/>Ser litt ut som den stygge, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD dyret bak corporatocracy prøver å skjule seg som en offshore oljerigg eller noe, ikke sant?<br/><br/>I sin kamp for tredje verdenskrig presser de også på for et opprør her for å kaste ut grunnloven i forbitrelse og forakt, slik at de kan erstatte den med sine egne design.<br/><br/>I min egen ide og forståelse må det være restriksjoner på hva som utgjør tale for å forhindre en bastardisering av begrepet og en altfor liberal tolkning av det første endringstillegget.<br/><br/>Vi trenger ikke å stille spørsmålet om regjeringen har en tvingende interesse i å hindre utenlandske personer eller foreninger fra å påvirke vår nasjons politiske prosess. Se 2 U.S. C. §441e (bidrags- og utgiftsforbud brukt på "utenlandske statsborgere"). Seksjon 441b er ikke begrenset til selskaper eller foreninger som ble opprettet i utlandet eller finansiert hovedsakelig av utenlandske aksjonærer. § 441b ville derfor være for bred selv om vi hevdet at regjeringen har en tvingende interesse i å begrense utenlandsk innflytelse over vår politiske prosess. Se Broadrick, 413<br/>U. S., på 615. >><br/><br/>USA gikk konkurs da FDR ringte inn gullet. Vi hadde ikke mer gull å betale for papiret vi lånte fra FED. Det er nå i en årlig konkursovergang. Regjeringen er nå privat som BLACKWATER. Alle offentlige etater er oppført på DUNN AND BRADSTREET. Den vanlige loven som grunnloven spesifiserer gjelder for naturlige mennesker. All virksomhet av domstolene i dag er bedriftens betydning at vi blir sett på som individuelle selskaper. Vi eksisterer ved kontrakt med staten. Husk den 14. endringen. Det var ingen amerikanske borgere før det. De fleste av oss har uvitende hevdet amerikansk bedriftsborgerskap. Vi må adressere regelen av bankeliten. Nesten alle ledende REPS og DEMS er medlemmer av Council of Foreign Relations eller TLC. Se opp historien om hvem som startet og kontrollerer disse. Rush, Glenn og Sean er alle løgnere og bankfolk bootlickers. Obama er en marionett for CFR. 911 sannheten har mye mer betydning og vil tjene til å forene de ærlige menneskene i dette landet.<br/><br/>Jeg tror egentlig ikke at jeg er et selskap eller borger av en, men hvis gubbermint mener det, betyr SCOTUS-dommen at det ikke er flere kampanjebidragsgrenser på noen, bedrifter eller enkeltpersoner? Jeg vil heller se penger fjernet fra vår valgprosess helt - lik tid på Amerikas airwaves gitt uten kostnad for alle kandidater. |
| And so the TWEWY Spriting Thread army set off, their destination being Japan. Unfortunately, no airline whatsoever would let them on board because of their rather large amassment of weapons of moderate destruction. And pitchtorches, which constituted both a fire and a stabbing hazard. And so, they just went home and downloaded the movie Kanon wanted to watch illegally. They gave it 7/10 stars on rotten tomatoes. The End.<br/><br/>Spoiler:The bottom right Sprite is the new one.<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text. Yes, he's using a sword. I like to be boring and generic like that. Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to.

Besides, no one else took the easy, predictable route, so somebody had to. Peace out.<br/><br/>The first sprite was half made by me. The second row contains a teaser for the continuation of the clown sprites i made a while back. And the third row is just a few old sprites that i decided to fix up and redo some parts.<br/><br/>So I just joined, and tried to make a sprite, it turned out ok, but it seemed like a lot of work, and I only made a few changes to neku. How do you make the complicated ones?<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>Highlight this box with your cursor to read the spoiler text.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>How to get better at spriting:<br/><br/>1. To start off, master the art of recoloring sprites and shading. 2. Next start copying and pasting body parts to other sprites. E.x Take the arm band off of neku and put it on joshua. 3. Start small by switching around body parts and re-coloring them. (in other words, just experiment and see which combo you like) 4. Then start to challenging yourself to make more complex sprites. Instead of copying and pasting and recoloring, you can try and draw clothes or faces. 5. PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. Keep practicing and experimenting and never give upPeace out.<br/><br/>Sometimes people need to be reminded not to give up so easily and continue to persist. | Og så satte TWEWY Spriting Thread hæren av, deres destinasjon var Japan. Dessverre ville ingen flyselskap overhodet la dem ombord på grunn av deres ganske store mengde våpen av moderat ødeleggelse. Og pitchtorches, som utgjorde både en brann og en knivstikkingsfare. Og så gikk de bare hjem og lastet ned filmen Kanon ønsket å se ulovlig. De ga den 7/10 stjerner på råtne tomater.

Start små ved å bytte rundt kroppsdeler og re-farge dem. (med andre ord, bare eksperimentere og se hvilken combo du liker) 4. Begynn deretter å utfordre deg selv til å lage mer komplekse sprites. I stedet for å kopiere og lime inn og recoloring, kan du prøve å tegne klær eller ansikter. 5. PRAKTISK PRAKSIS OG MER PRAKTISK. Fortsett å øve og eksperimentere og aldri gi oppfred ut.<br/><br/>Noen ganger må folk bli påminnet om ikke å gi opp så lett og fortsette å fortsette. |
| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Tolkningssammendrag: Dette bokkapitlet gjennomgår ulike aspekter av hva som trengs for valg av modell ugress for å svare på spørsmål som er relevante for ugressvitenskap. Spesielt kapittelet dekker hvorfor vi trenger modell arter, attributter av modell arter, og gir dagens kunnskap og ressurser som har blitt utviklet for noen viktige ugress som blader spurge, Canada tistel, vannhamp, og lilla falsk brom som kan gjøre dem gode potensielle modeller.<br/><br/>Teknisk abstrakt:<br/>Utvalg av et begrenset antall modellugress og utvikling av genombaserte verktøy og ressurser vil legge til rette for studier av økologi, biologi, fysiologi og utvikling av ugressarter. Slike studier vil bidra til å svare på grunnleggende spørsmål av bekymring for ugressforskere. Men for å sikre at ugressvitenskapssamfunnet kan utnytte disse modellugressene riktig og fullt ut, må de velges nøye. Ulike attributter som letthet av studien, ugress egenskaper, og betydning som en ugressart må vurderes. I tillegg kan tilgjengeligheten av eksisterende genomiske ressurser brukes til å utvide listen over levedyktige modell ugress. Flere ressurser har også blitt utviklet spesielt for ugress som blader spurge, Canada tistel, vannhamp, og lilla falsk brom. |
