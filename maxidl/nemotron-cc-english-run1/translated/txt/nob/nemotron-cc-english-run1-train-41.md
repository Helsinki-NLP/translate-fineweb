| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>Nyhetsbrev november 2015<br/>Publisert av Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa er en flerårig plante som trives i myrlendte subtropiske og tropiske regioner rundt om i verden. Den høyt ansett urt er en viktig ingrediens i Doxiderol, et kosttilskudd som forbedrer kognitiv funksjon. Bacopa ble valgt for sin evne til å beskytte hjernen og øke acetylkolin, en biokjemisk budbringer som gjør at nervesystemet til å videresende informasjon.<br/><br/>Ayurvediske utøvere beskrev først de terapeutiske egenskapene til bacopa i 300 f.Kr. Legene registrerte bacopas evner til å forbedre intelligens og minne. Nesten 2500 år senere bekrefter en voksende mengde moderne forskning de kognitive fordelene med bacopa registrert i den ayurvediske teksten.<br/><br/>I 1987 evaluerte forskere i India effekten av bacopa på intellektuell funksjon hos barn i skolealderen. I løpet av fire ukers studie administrerte de bacopa til 40 barn som var 6 til 8 år gamle. Forskerne fastslo at bacopa økte persepsjon og hukommelse. Barna var i stand til å løse labyrintøvelser raskere og mer nøyaktig etter å ha fått bacopa. Mange foreldre i India bruker rutinemessig bacopa for å forbedre sine barns intellektuelle utvikling.<br/><br/>En 12-ukers studie publisert i august 2001-utgaven av Psychopharmacology undersøkte effekten av bacopa på kognitiv funksjon. Forskere tildelte tilfeldig de friske frivillige, i alderen 18 til 65, for å få bacopa eller et inaktivt stoff. De brukte også en dobbeltblind konfigurasjon for studien for å skjule identitetene til produktene. Forskere bruker dette designet for å sikre at testresultatene er gyldige fordi det eliminerer bias av forskerne og deltakerne. Bacopa-gruppen opplevde en betydelig forbedring i hvor raskt de var i stand til å behandle visuell informasjon. Deltakerne lærte også raskere og lagret nye minner mer effektivt.<br/><br/>I 2007 avslørte en laboratoriestudie fra Texas A & M College of Medicine en av mekanismene som er ansvarlige for bacopas evne til å fremme hjernens helse. Ifølge forskerne bruker bacopa polyfenoler for å forhindre oksidativt stress og skaden det forårsaker på sunne hjerneceller. Bacopa reduserer også skadelige innskudd av et stoff kjent som beta-amyloid, som er den primære komponenten av plakk i hjernen til pasienter med Alzheimers sykdom.<br/><br/>En dobbeltblind studie publisert i juli 2008-utgaven av Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluerte effekten av bacopa på eldre pasienter. Studien bekreftet at bacopa økte kognitiv ytelse samtidig som stress ble redusert. Ifølge forfatterne bekreftet fordelene som ble oppnådd i denne studien resultatene av tidligere forskning.<br/><br/>En 90-dagers studie publisert i desember 2008-utgaven av Phytotherapy Research bekrefter de kognitive fordelene som tidligere ble demonstrert i andre bacopa-studier. Bacopa forbedret betydelig deltakernes evne til midlertidig å lagre og bruke informasjon som kreves for å fullføre en kompleks oppgave. Den dobbeltblinde studien viste også at bacopa reduserte tiden som kreves for å behandle visuell informasjon.<br/><br/>I tillegg til å øke nervesignaloverføringen, teoretiserer forskerne at bacopa øker kognitiv funksjon ved å redusere angst. Tallrike studier indikerer at angst forstyrrer evnen til å utføre oppgaver som krever kognitive funksjoner på høyere nivå, for eksempel læring og memorisering. Stress forstyrrer biokjemiske budbringere og sunn nervesignaloverføring. Bacopa lindrer stress og gjenoppretter en følelse av ro ved å øke acetylkolin nivåer, noe som reduserer hjertefrekvensen og gjør at du kan ta dypere åndedrag.<br/><br/>Doxiderol er en fin måte å få fordelene med bacopa. Dette holistiske supplementet inneholder også andre naturlige ingredienser som fremmer hjernens helse og støtter din evne til å fokusere og konsentrere seg om kompleks oppgave, samt huske informasjon. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Hun kan også føle demonisk aura samt onde auraer. Da hun ble født og vokste, ble hennes krefter forseglet, og hun var mye mindre kraftig. Siden nederlaget til den som forsegler hennes krefter, har Kagome nådd sitt fulle potensial.<br/><br/>Ved å skape en fysisk forbindelse har Kagome evnen til å rense både gift og mørke fra et subjekt (levende og livløs). For å gjøre det, projiserer hun sine åndelige krefter gjennom hånden.<br/><br/>Med sitt fulle potensiale har Kagome evnen til å skape en barriere rundt seg selv og utvide den rundt andre. Det er en kuppelformet barriere som kan ødelegge svake demoner som kommer i kontakt med barrieren.<br/><br/>FORBEDRET EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome har evnen til å se ting som ofte er usynlige for det menneskelige øye: spøkelser, ånder, guddommelige og onde auraer.<br/><br/>MULIGHETER MED VÅPEN<br/>Kagome har evnen til å bruke en bue og pil. Hun har vært selv trent, og etter mange års praksis, hennes pil sjelden savner sitt merke. Ved siden av dette, Kagome har evnen til å infundere sine piler med krefter. Hun kan infuse en pil med sine åndelige krefter som tillater dem å trenge demoniske krefter, ødelegge staver, og rense objekter. Hun kan infuse sin bue med sine krefter og avlede fiendtlige angrep. Hun har evnen til å infuse sine piler med rensende energi for å rense gift, så vel som kraftige, fjerne demoniske angrep. Og til slutt har hun muligheten til å omgå andre med pilen: Hvis målet hennes tilfeldigvis er bak en barriere eller et gissel, kan pilen teleportere og bare treffe målet hennes.<br/><br/>Resten av hennes evner har blitt ganske ubetydelige da de er relatert til tidsreiser (gjennom Bone Eater's Well), Shikon Jewel, eller hennes tidligere inkarnasjon.<br/><br/>kanonen<br/><br/>Kagome har blitt trukket noen dager etter at hun ble uteksaminert fra videregående skole, men før Bone Eater's Well har åpnet igjen for å tillate henne å gå tilbake til fortiden for godt.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>Minner<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Lyden av navnet hennes var en myk hvisking i bakhodet hennes, som et kall dempet av vinden. Det var lyden av et fjernt minne, en stemme som hun hadde begynt å glemme, men desperat klamret seg til alt det samme. Det var hennes mors stemme, vridd i sorgen til sin tapte datter. Etter alt, Kagome forvist uten spor. Hun husket levende disse øyeblikkene, måten dagen hadde begynt, hva hun hadde til frokost og det siste hun hadde sagt til sin mor. Det var hjemsøkende, de minnene, fordi det var som enhver annen gang hun hadde glidd mellom verdener. Hun hadde våknet, listløs, fordi hun ikke hadde noe formål utenfor skolen. Hun kunne finne en jobb, og var planlagt for et intervju den dagen. Hennes hjerte hadde ikke vært i det, men det var det hun trengte å gjøre.<br/><br/>Hun husket følelsen av frykt, sugde det opp og ga seg en pep talk at hun kunne gjøre dette. At hun kunne utvikle seg i livet som hun var ment å nå at ting hadde blitt avgjort i fortiden. Selvfølgelig hadde hun den dvelende følelsen av at hun ikke lenger hørte hjemme i sin egen tid eller i sitt eget liv. Ikke med alt hun hadde forlatt.<br/><br/>Kagome husket følelsen av treet under fingrene, måten hånden hennes hadde krøllet seg inn i håndtaket for å skyve døren åpen. Hun husket at hun stoppet og snudde seg til sin mor med et lyst og levende smil da hun ristet seg fra sin stupor. "Jeg tar av." Hun husket hvor sterk stemmen hennes hørtes, smilet på hennes mors lepper da øynene hennes skinte med stolthet. Hennes mor tok farvel med henne, noe som ikke virket annerledes enn før, men på en eller annen måte tyngden av ordene avgjort i tyngre på Kagome skuldre jo mer hun reflekterte.<br/><br/>Kort sagt, tankene flimret fremover, lurer på om hennes mor bekymret for henne, savnet henne som hun gjorde. Kagome kunne åpent innrømme at hennes mors styrke, hennes støtte til det faktum at datteren hennes gled gjennom tiden så ofte. Det var tider da hun trodde seg svak for ikke å ha kvinnen til å lene seg på.<br/><br/>Hun husket imidlertid at hun hadde samlet opp en liten mengde styrke, og at hun kunne huske hvordan luften skiftet, temperaturen var bemerkelsesverdig forskjellig fra det hun hadde forventet, og at hun blunket til de plutselige og ukjente omgivelsene. Det var ikke hennes families helligdom. Og da hun snudde seg for å gå tilbake, for å skli gjennom døren hun hadde kommet gjennom, ble hun møtt med ukjent og kaldt metall under fingertuppene og et interiør som ikke var inngangen til huset hennes. En mann sto foran henne, bak en disk, og stirret på henne med øyne så brede som hennes egne.<br/><br/>Hun fikk i hvert fall ikke panikk, men ble revet gjennom tiden og plassert i umulige situasjoner, bygde i det minste viljestyrken din så langt som merkelige hendelser gikk. Fordi det ikke var hver dag at noen fant seg trukket inn i fortiden av en demon, med sikte på å rive en kraftig juvel fra kroppen deres som de ikke engang visste var der. Og så var det det faktum at hun hadde knust sa kraftig juvel inn som vet hvor mange brikker og var oppgave på å finne dem. Slike ting var ikke normalt, og hun hadde behov for å firkante opp og rulle med det når hun skjønte at det var hennes virkelighet. Det hadde virket så enkelt, bare samle fragmentene og fikse juvelen.<br/><br/>Men det hadde ikke vært lett, det var mange demoner etter flisene og juvelen selv. Og en spesielt kraftig demon med et ønske om at han var fast bestemt på å se oppfylt. Til denne dag hadde hun aldri lært hans ønske, men visste at det aldri hadde blitt gitt selv når han hadde sprengt ting ferdig. Han hadde ødelagt så mange liv for ingenting. Ødelagt så mange liv for en så meningsløs oppgave. Naraku hadde vært den vanskeligste fienden, og den som hadde vært sentrum for alt som hadde gått galt i hele hennes venns liv.<br/><br/>Men det var den uforutsigbarheten, den nødvendigheten av å rulle med det som skjedde og viljestyrken hun hadde fått fra hennes eventyr som hun husket å tegne på for å komme opp med en historie som passer i øyeblikket som ikke virket for lunefull eller langt hentet. Hun trengte å bli trodd, hun trengte å overleve.<br/><br/>Etter alt, møtte hun verre enn en mann i en kamerabutikk. Hun hadde løyet gjennom tennene for å redde livet hennes før.<br/><br/>"Jeg var på utkikk etter en jobb." Til slutt var det ikke en fullstendig løgn. Tross alt hadde hun satt ut av huset hennes med den hensikt å delta på et jobbintervju. Hennes tilstand av kjole ville i det minste attestere så mye. Det var en av de enklere fibs hun noensinne hadde fortalt.<br/><br/>Og av en eller annen grunn hyret den gale mannen henne.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rullet over i sengen hennes da hun presset tilbake de fjerne minnene, nektet å erkjenne at hun virkelig var våken. Hun klødde ved de siste glimtene av søvn, og ba om å komme tilbake og ta henne tilbake i sin omfavnelse. Hun lukket øynene, villig til å sove for å komme og ble bare møtt med minner. Ekkoet av en sang sang i det fjerne av hennes minner, en sang som ofte hadde plaget henne, gitt samme navn som henne. Stemmen som sang var ikke lenger minner om sin mor, men stemmene til barn som hun ofte hadde spilt med å vokse opp. De kalte tilbake minnene, selv om det hadde vært år siden hun startet dette live, selv om hun var lykkelig i dette livet, var kallet til disse minnene for høyt.<br/><br/>Plutselig falt hun tilbake i dem og søvn unnslapp henne igjen. Hun så på seg selv i familiens omfavnelse mens Inuyasha ble trukket tilbake i brønnen, så like skremt som hun hadde følt. Minnene fra det øyeblikket, disse følelsene, var fortsatt så sterke. Følelsen av hjertesorg og sorg svellet opp igjen, selv om det hadde vært så lenge siden hun hadde følt at hun hadde blitt revet bort fra alt som betydde noe for henne.<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig betydde familien hennes noe, og hun var glad for å være i armene deres igjen. Hun kunne aldri fullt ut beskrive hvordan hun hadde følt seg på den tiden. Hun kunne fortsatt ikke forklare hvordan hun følte seg delt i to, med stridende ønsker om å være i både sin fortid og nåtid. Hun husket de nytteløse forsøkene på å hoppe gjennom brønnen, fingrene klør i bakken i en desperat bønn om å la henne komme tilbake. Den første måneden hjemme sov hun ikke så mye som hun gråt.<br/><br/>Elysion hadde garnert en lignende reaksjon, selv om det ikke var så voldsomt fordi hun ikke visste nøyaktig hvor hun hadde glidd gjennom, heller ikke visste hun hvor hun kunne ormen sin vei tilbake. Hennes utforskninger var subtile mellom å jobbe jobben sin og prøve å bosette seg i dette livet. Hun hadde ingen intensjoner om å bli, ingen intensjoner om å dvele lenger enn hun trengte. Og selv om hun ikke prøvde så hardt som da hun prøvde å gå tilbake til fortiden, ble hennes lidenskap tidoblet fordi hun ikke hadde noen bånd til denne verden. Fordi hun var virkelig alene... uten håp om at noen skulle nå henne.<br/><br/>I hennes irrasjonelle øyeblikk trodde hun at juvelen hadde trukket henne tilbake og funnet et nytt helvete for henne å bo i. Et nytt helvete som ville tvinge henne til å ønske, men hun husket veldig tydelig at hun hadde ønsket det borte for alltid. Det stoppet ikke drømmene hennes, de gangene da hun våknet i nattemørket, og minnene fra fortiden hennes var de vanskeligste å forholde seg til, de vanskeligste å glemme. Hjertet hennes begynte å rase i panikk da hun snudde seg i sengen igjen, pusten hennes ble en kamp da hun kjempet mot et panikkanfall indusert av hennes vandrende sinn så sent på kvelden.<br/><br/>Hun hatet å føle seg så svak, så redd.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome trakk seg til slutt ut av sengen, rommet hennes lyste med et blekt lys som var nok til å lede henne til badet. Hun sto foran speilet, vasken løp mens hun stirret på hennes refleksjon. Raven farget hår dekket ansiktet hennes, og hun følte seg så ille som hun så ut. Hennes første morgen i Elysion var lik dette, bare hun var i verre form.<br/><br/>Hun hadde funnet et sted å sove, klarer å utarbeide en avtale med eieren av bygningen for å tillate henne å bo en liten periode uten å betale. Kanskje det hadde vært Miroku innflytelse som tillot henne å gjøre slike avtaler, som munken var kjent for sin måte i sjarmerende (eller svindle) folk til å gi dem mer enn nok for arbeidet de hadde gjort. Munken hadde alltid vært slik, siden de først hadde møtt. Han ville kreve en herres bolig å bli hjemsøkt når det ikke var eller hevder at de ble utsatt for et angrep når de ikke ville være. Han ville selge sine menigheter og charms for slike høye priser. Det fungerte nesten hver gang, og hun lurte på hvorfor folk hadde vært så villige til å stole på ham.<br/><br/>Kanskje var det smilet hans, eller det faktum at han var en munk at folk i fortiden var så villige til å smuldre. Han jaktet aldri på de svake, i det minste. Han gjorde alltid det som var riktig, og han var et symbol på styrke for henne til tider da han ville presse gjennom alt for å gjøre det som var riktig. Han presset gjennom det faktum at han var døende, at han var forbannet, og prøvde å gjøre noe med det i stedet for å velte seg i sin skjebne. Han hadde presset seg til grensen i tiden før den endelige kampen. Og hun hadde vært glad for at de hadde beseiret Naraku før han kunne bli utsatt for samme skjebne som sin far, og hans far før ham.<br/><br/>Så langt som hennes egen sjarm gikk, var hun imidlertid mer rettferdig enn sin venn og gjorde avtalen rimelig. Hun tvilte på at noen i denne verden ville betale en heftig pris for en eksorsisme eller forvise demoner. De var for teknologisk avanserte for det. Men hun var smart nok, og smart nok, til å gjøre en god avtale.<br/><br/>Men nå var Kagome på et bedre sted, selv om ansiktet hennes så det samme ut. Hjemsøkt, sliten, drenert...<br/><br/>Et raskt blikk på en klokke på veggen fortalte henne at hun kunne prøve å sove lenger. Men hun valgte bort det, ikke ønsker å møte flashbacks igjen. Hun tok en dusj i stedet, ved hjelp av det kalde vannet for å jage bort sine demoner, for å fylle lungene med et skarpt pust og tvinge seg våken.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Det fungerte ikke.<br/><br/>Ikke på den måten hun ønsket. Det kalde vannet tvang absolutt luften inn i lungene hennes, tvang tankene hennes til å våkne og musklene til å gripe. En bitter latter ble trukket fra leppene hennes da hun vippet hodet tilbake og fant seg selv å huske mer. I dag ville hun ikke unnslippe dem så lett. Hun ville ikke komme seg så enkelt, for å komme seg bare fordi hun ville det.<br/><br/>Noen ganger kan du ikke unngå tankene du ville, selv når du var sikker på at du var forbi dem.<br/><br/>Sango ville ha vært til stor hjelp i denne situasjonen. Demonmorderen var hennes beste venn, hun ville til og med gå så langt som å kalle henne søsteren som hun aldri hadde. En eldre søster som var klok, hadde alltid sin side når problemer oppstod. Spesielt gutt problemer, når slike ting var ganske trivielt, men det var morsomt å ha en forelskelse og for hennes venn å være sint på hennes vegne når Inuyasha gjorde henne trist. Tross alt hadde det ofte vært at halvdemonen ville løpe til sin døde elskers side og knuse hennes hjerte mer enn en gang.<br/><br/>Men Sango inspirerte henne også på andre måter. Etter alt kvinnen hadde møtt, hadde hun alltid vært så sterk, så sikker... Selv i tider som hun hadde tvilt på seg selv, trakk hun alltid gjennom. Hun beundret at hun hadde evnen til å overleve etter å ha mistet hele familien - påminnelsen om dette presset ofte Kagome til å overleve, fordi hun mistet alle til denne verden - og da har hennes bror blitt en bonde av Naraku. Det var ikke lett, kunne ikke ha vært noe som bare noen kunne møte og fortsatt gå videre med. Hun smilte fortsatt, selv med den smerten og de påminnelsene... Hun var ofte så lys, selv i de mørkere tider.<br/><br/>Og akkurat nå ønsket hun å lene seg inn i den eldre kvinnens side, for å trøste seg i det faktum at hun var der og hun var støttende. Hun følte at Sango på en eller annen måte ville trekke gjennom dette, og tilby noen ord med styrke og forståelse. Det var tider som disse som gjorde disse stavene verre, den konstante påminnelsen om at hun var uten sin familie.<br/><br/>"Jeg vil ikke være alene." Hun ropte høyt i sin ensomhet, lyden av dusjen drukner ut bønnen.<br/><br/>Hun var ikke redd for å innrømme det.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>En annen time hadde glidd forbi før hun hadde innsett det. Huden hennes var kald fra vannet og det føltes som is løp gjennom hennes årer. Hun hadde ikke innsett at hun hadde begynt å skjelve før hånden hennes nådde for å slå av vannet og avslutte dusjen hennes. Kagome søkte ikke sitt eget blikk i speilet igjen, i stedet pakket hun seg inn i håndklær og gikk ut av badet, opp trappen og inn på kjøkkenet. Hun begynte på å lage en lett frokost, idly lese gjennom sine notater for dagen som maten kokte.<br/><br/>Hennes karriere tok virkelig av de siste årene. Hennes bilder ble omtalt i mange gallerier, hennes navn begynte å hyppige mange lepper for de som var interessert i fotografering.<br/><br/>Jobben hun hadde bedt om på et innfall hadde utløst alt. Hun hadde vært langt heldigere enn hun hadde forventet å være i denne verden. Aldri heldig nok til å skli tilbake gjennom sprekkene i sin egen verden, men heldig nok til å gjøre det bra. Da hun vendte tilbake til ovnen, husket hun den tiden hun endelig hadde gitt opp da hun kom hjem. Det var omtrent to år inn i livet hennes her, da hun hadde begynt å våge seg inn i fotografering som mer enn bare en hobby, men noe hun kunne gjøre et navn for seg selv med.<br/><br/>Den dagen hadde vært spesielt hyggelig, solen var høyt på himmelen, og hun hadde funnet seg selv å ta noen bilder av det naturlige landskapet. En liten gutt hadde gjemt seg i en av plantene, og hun hadde tatt et bilde av det øyeblikket ansiktet hans hadde slått seg ned i et muntert, rampete smil i øyeblikket før han hadde hoppet ut for å skremme byttet sitt. Det minnet henne om Shippou, den lille kitsunen hun egentlig hadde adoptert. Han hadde også blitt revet fra sin familie da de først møttes. Hans far drepte og han var fast bestemt på å hevne ham. Mens han var ung, virket han så moden i sine første møter.<br/><br/>Kanskje det hadde vært påvirkning av Inuyasha som tillot settet å fungere som et barn igjen, for å være ung og lunefull til tider mens andre han var mer moden. Han tilbød henne trøst på sin egen måte, og hun prøvde å ta vare på ham som hun ville hennes egen selv om hun hadde vært så ung da også. Men hennes ungdom ikke stoppe henne fra å forstå hvordan å ta vare på ham eller ta vare på ham som hennes barn. Hjertet hennes hovnet da han smilte, da han hadde vært så glad for sin gave av fargestifter og tok seg tid til å lage kunst. Hun var så stolt av hver tegning han hadde fullført at hun visste at det var slik en mor ville føle seg i en slik situasjon.<br/><br/>Smerten som hadde revet gjennom henne var for mye, for plutselig. Hun savnet ham og ønsket å se hvor mye han hadde vokst siden hun hadde vært borte. Hun hadde savnet så mye...<br/><br/>For å skåne seg selv for mer smerte og falske forhåpninger ga hun opp og fokuserte på å bli bedre.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Frokost smakte kjedelig, kjedelig og inspirert. Først etter at hun var ferdig innså hun at hun hadde glemt å noen form for krydder eller smak til maten. Det var for sent nå å huske så mye, da hennes sinn var for opptatt med å huske andre detaljer i livet hennes som tydeligvis hadde blitt viktigere enn maten hennes.<br/><br/>"Sitt!"<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig skjedde ingenting da hun hadde sint ropt på en spesielt frustrerende klient som minnet henne om halvdemonen. Han var spesielt sta og uhøflig, og ønsket et bilde tatt på sin måte i stedet for å la det fungere naturlig. Du kan prøve å tvinge ville dyr til å oppføre seg som du ønsket. Men, sjelden gjorde noen lykkes med makt. Inuyasha var ikke så ille, men. Inuyasha hadde lært før hun hadde blitt tvunget bort fra ham. Han hadde blitt mildere, mer forståelsesfull, mer moden, selv om det var tider da han fortsatt var barnslig og cocky.<br/><br/>Hun husker hvor røde kinnene hennes hadde brent, men hvordan hun sto på bakken og sparket ham. Hun fortalte ham at hun nektet å jobbe for noen eller med noen som ønsket å vri noe utover det er natur, utover det egne ønsker.<br/><br/>Hun burde ha sammenlignet mannen til Naraku i stedet for Inuyasha. Selv om hennes klient ikke hadde slike ekstreme intensjoner. I det minste var følelsen etterpå et hyggelig minne. Friheten til å vite at hun hadde kommet så langt at hun kunne nekte arbeid som hun ikke ville gjøre, å være sin egen person som var uavhengig av andre. Hun kunne si at hun gjorde det på det tidspunktet. Selv om hun hørte rykter dager senere med ord som var ment å sverte henne.<br/><br/>Hun forsvarte seg rettferdig, som hun gjorde mot slutten av sin reise. Tross alt var hun den eneste som kunne beskytte seg i denne verden.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morgenlyset begynte å krype inn i hjemmet hennes, og minnet henne igjen om tidens gang. Igjen vurderte hun listen over ting hun måtte gjøre og diskuterte hvor hun skulle begynne. Eller om hun skulle begynne i det hele tatt. Med hvordan dagen begynte, visste hun ikke om hun kunne vurdere det en god ide. Det var tvilsomt at hun ville lykkes med hvor tapt i seg selv hun ble.<br/><br/>Hun ville ikke rote til det siste arbeidet sitt, for det hadde hun gjort et par ganger før. Det var ikke hyggelig å prøve å komme seg etter en total katastrofe.<br/><br/>Kagome husket følelsen av hennes dyre, splitter nye kamera som gled fra hendene. Hun var ikke forberedt på å støtte det, fordi hun nettopp hadde fjernet det fra vesken hennes. En del av henne skrek på innsiden. En dramatisk, over-the-top, full på skrik som hun ofte gjorde da hun var mye, mye yngre. Når hun kjempet for å gjøre det gjennom ungdomsskolen mens du hopper mellom ganger. Den andre delen av henne hadde forblitt frosset på plass mens linsen hennes helt knust og resten av kameraet hadde brutt sammen med det.<br/><br/>Å se Inuyasha bror, en full demon, stående foran henne var det siste hun forventet da hun hadde gjort sin vei ut for hennes bilder. Han sto så stolt som noensinne, så høy som noensinne, så imponerende som hun husket. Han så ikke fazed i det hele tatt for å være i en helt annen verden, selv om hun aldri var den beste til å lese tankene hans. Hans navn på leppene hennes var så kraftig, at hun kunne huske de minste følelsene som hun gjorde. Leppene hennes var sprukne, munnen hennes føltes tørr, og den boblende følelsen av angst i magen hennes fikk henne til å føle seg syk.<br/><br/>Hun ville ikke at hennes håp skulle være oppe.<br/><br/>Men hun ville at han skulle være der, selv om de ikke var venner. De var allierte, om noe, siden de hadde kjempet side om side. Og noe var bedre enn absolutt ingenting.<br/><br/>Og Kagome hadde sans nok til ikke å kaste seg på ham, for å vikle armene rundt ham i lettelse som visste at hun ikke var alene. Kameraet hennes spilte ingen rolle lenger da hun nærmet seg ham. Hun husket at ingenting annet betydde for dager da hun tilbrakte tid med ham, ikke å snakke om deres verden, men å snakke (eller, hun snakket og han bare anerkjente det faktum).<br/><br/>Da hun falt for ham skjønt... Kagome kunne ikke huske. Det var en subtil ting, akkurat som han var. Men hun visste at følelsen var der. Og han lot henne vite at hun ikke var alene i det faktum at hun hadde falt, at følelsene hadde på en eller annen måte blomstret.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>En følelse av vektløshet overmannet henne, og plutselig åpnet øynene hennes mens hennes sinn desperat klødde for det siste hun gjorde. Hun husket ikke når hun hadde sovnet på sofaen, men hun visste at det siste stedet hun hadde vært var på altfor komfortable puter. Hun kjempet ikke, men eller kjempet vektløshet som hun var i kjente armer. Hodet hennes vippet mot Sesshoumarus bryst, og trøstet seg med at han var her, og at hun ikke var alene.<br/><br/>"Velkommen tilbake." Hans svar var en myk hum i anerkjennelse. Han trengte ikke å si mye for henne å forstå hans hensikt, eller resten av det han hadde å si.<br/><br/>Han bar henne tilbake til sengen hennes, slo henne ned i den med letthet. Øynene hennes møtte hans og hun smilte lett fordi ingen flere minner drev tilbake, ingen flere erindringer ertet på henne. Nei, når han var i nærheten, falt hun aldri tilbake i disse tankene. Han hadde hjulpet, og årene hadde hjulpet. l dag var bare en av de dagene.<br/><br/>"Sov." Han befalte med letthet, øynene hennes rullet på ham, men hun kjempet ikke fordi hun var sliten. Hennes hånd klamret seg tett til ham, mens hun følte motsatt hånd press til pannen hennes i vurdering av hennes velvære.<br/><br/>"Jeg er ok," sa hun, hennes ord fast med sitt løfte.<br/><br/>Hun var i live, og hun var lykkelig.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>oppsummering<br/><br/>Kagome, på et tidspunkt i sitt liv, var en ganske vanlig tenåringsjente til hun ble angrepet av en demon inne i familiens brønnhus. Demonen dro henne ned i brønnen, som magisk transportert henne rundt 500 år tilbake i tid. Der lærte hun at en hellig juvel var innkapslet i kroppen hennes som hun var reinkarnasjonen av en prestinne som hadde dødd 50 år før tiden hun ble trukket inn i. Juvelen ble revet fra kroppen hennes og demonen som dro henne gjennom tiden ble beseiret av halv-demonen som hun frigjorde som ble festet til treet. Kagome ble venn med halvdemonen, Inuyasha, i tide og reiste med ham for å gjenopprette juvelen som hun selv knuste. Selv om det ikke var så enkelt og lett å gjøre som mange demoner og mennesker søkte juvelen for sine egne formål. Hun ble venn med en ung kitsune demon, en munk og en demon morder som alle reiste med henne for å gjenopprette juvelen.<br/><br/>Hennes gruppe var imidlertid ikke den som fullførte juvelen. I stedet var en ond halv-demon som manipulerte de fleste av de store hendelsene i de fleste av hennes følges liv. Da han endelig samlet alle bitene av juvelen og gjorde sitt ønske om det forurensede objektet, ble Kagome trukket inn i selve juvelen med den hensikt å gjøre et egoistisk ønske om å holde henne fanget inne for alltid, og holde juvelen i live. Det var staheten til Inuyasha som klarte å redde henne fra mørket. Til slutt kom hun tilbake til sin naturlige tid, fullførte videregående skole som forventet fra en jente på hennes tidslinje. Selv om dager senere endte Kagome i Elysion. Hun har vært i denne verden i fem år, og har lenge siden gitt opp på å vende hjem. Hun har bosatt seg lykkelig i sitt nye liv.<br/><br/>platonisk<br/><br/>Det er ganske lett for Kagome å få nye venner, hun har ikke forandret seg mye fra sin ungdom. Hun er en munter ung kvinne som er empatisk og innbydende til det meste av alt i sitt liv. I sin ungdom ble hun venner med demoner når de fleste ville frykte dem. Selv demoner som pleide å spise mennesker, hun har blitt venner og hun endret sine måter (hun ønsker å tenke). Når det er sagt, er det veldig lett å bli hennes venn så lenge noen er i stand til å vise at de er villige til å bli forløst, eller vise at de ikke er helt onde. Hun føler sterkt for alle hun møter, så det er vanskelig for henne å ikke bli tiltrukket av andre i et ønske om å være venner.<br/><br/>antagonistisk<br/><br/>Den eneste måten å tjene Kagomes vrede er å være så beklagelig, så ond, og så langt utover forløsning at hun ikke kan se noe godt i deg. Og hun kan se det gode i stort sett alle og alt. Ærlig talt, hvem har hun møtt? En halv-demon som satte to elskere opp mot hverandre, som forbannet hele den mannlige linjen til en av vennene hennes, og så fikk hennes beste venns bror til å drepe familien deres... Ja, jeg ser ikke at hun hater noen uten at de virkelig, virkelig jobber for det. Føl deg fri til å gi det et skudd, skjønt.<br/><br/>romantiske<br/><br/>Når forelsket, Kagome er en sterk støtte, alltid bor der selv når ting kan være grov. Men, Kagome er ikke ute etter kjærlighet, var ikke ute etter kjærlighet da hun kom så noen tidligere relasjoner ikke eksisterer. Dette er ikke å si at noen ikke har blitt forelsket i henne. Hun kan definitivt være gjenstand for noens ubesvarte kjærlighet, hun vil sannsynligvis være uvitende om det, skjønt. Til slutt er Kagome for tiden forlovet med Sesshoumaru, overraskende. Jeg er helt åpen for potensielle ting. <3<br/><br/>fandom helvete<br/><br/>oldtiden<br/><br/>arter plass dronning<br/><br/>Yrke døende<br/><br/>Foretrekker hun/han<br/><br/>Utmerkelser<br/><br/>pro hun / hun er 62woo jeg suger på tomten svar. men ok uansett!!! neptune er veldig vennlig og har den "kule" personen, han er veldig morsom å være rundt, og han er SUPER god å jobbe med. som han er super pasient, og han vil gjøre alt hun ber om ham - han er veldig lett å jobbe med, definitivt i forhold til andre modeller. så jeg elsker ideen om at de alle er arbeidsorienterte venner først og deretter blir til noe mer.

Ærlig talt har hun ikke jobbet gjennom alt ennå siden hun i hovedsak var i spissen for en fullskala krig. Jeg føler at de kunne være venner som Corrin er ganske åpen i sin personlighet, ekstremt tillitsfull også. Hun bare... gjemmer seg og sliter gjennom mye.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Hvorfor du bør være på Twitter<br/><br/>Ansvarsfraskrivelse: Jeg er ikke, og har heller aldri hevdet å være, en sosial media guru. Jeg er bare en person som tenker på ting mye, og dette har kommet opp en rekke ganger.<br/><br/>Jeg er ikke en tidlig adopter. Noen ganger tar det meg år å finne ut hva jeg vil bruke noe til før jeg faktisk kommer på det, og Twitter var en av de tingene. Jeg har vært på Twitter seriøst siden om februar i år, så jeg er ganske ny på det. Likevel har jeg lært en rekke ting, og jeg ønsket å dele dem. Noen sier at jeg er en Twitter-pusher, og jeg er, fordi det er mange gode grunner til å komme på det, og nesten ingen ulemper.<br/><br/>Så hva er Twitter? Hvis du er på internett, har du sikkert hørt om det. Det er et sosialt medienettverk som fungerer som et forum for samtaler, oppdateringer og nyheter i et medium mer offentlig enn noe som Facebook eller LinkedIn. Facebook handler om hvem som vil finne deg, men Twitter handler om hvem du vil finne. Dine favorittforfattere, skuespillere, politikere, sangere og forskere er sannsynligvis på Twitter. Det er også dine favoritt veldedighetsorganisasjoner, radiostasjoner, nyhetssider og butikker. Og de vil at du skal finne dem og lytte til hva de har å si. Alle på Twitter, i hvert fall i utgangspunktet, ønsker å snakke med deg.<br/><br/>Men hvorfor bli med på det? Hvorfor være en del av det? Det er alle slags grunner, og jeg skal gi deg noen.<br/><br/>Folk og steder Twitter er en fin måte å finne ut om hendelser som skjer rundt om i verden, men også i samfunnet ditt. Hvis du reiser og leter etter ting å gjøre, er det en fin måte å finne ut om ting som er relevante for dine interesser (fordi folkene du følger er folk du er interessert i). Selv om du ikke reiser, vet om gode steder å gå lokalt eller å vite at folk du er interessert i kommer til dem, skaper en mulighet til å møte dem og skape et dypere forhold til dem. Hvis du går tilbake til festinnlegget mitt, alle menneskene i det, men to, hørte jeg om på Twitter og møttes i det virkelige liv, og nå er vi ganske gode venner. Og jo mer du gjør dette, jo flere ting vil du finne ut om, og jo flere mennesker du møter. Og hvis du følger dem på Twitter, vet du allerede litt om hvordan de er. De vil at du skal. Det motsatte er også sant, fordi tweeting inviterer folk til å se hva du er, og de kan gjøre de samme valgene om deg.<br/><br/>Inspirasjon og motivasjon<br/>Inspirasjon kommer fra de merkeligste stedene, og tilstrømningen av tweets betyr at det alltid er nytt innhold for fantasien din. Jeg har en følge første policy, så jeg vil følge omtrent hvem som helst, og deretter periodisk gå gjennom og slutte å følge folk. Jeg vet ikke hvem som skal plante frøet til et nytt blogginnlegg eller nytt prosjekt i meg, så jeg liker å holde alternativene mine åpne. Motivasjon skjer også, fordi Twitter er akkurat som livet. Hvis du omgir deg med mennesker som er ambisiøse, dedikerte, sjenerøse og hardt arbeidende, er det lettere å være slik, og presse deg selv. Det er lettere å tenke at hvis de kan planlegge arrangementer, lansere prosjekter, eller bare stå opp om morgenen, vel, det kan du også.<br/><br/>Læring og livsstil Bloggere er på Twitter. Bloggere som ikke er, kan faktisk være gale. Og folk blogger om omtrent alt. Hvis du ønsker å lære noe, er oddsene gode at noen tweeter om det. På toppen av det, nyhetstjenester og butikker er også koblet, noe som betyr at du kan få nyheter opp til minutt, og finne ut om salg og avtaler som de starter. Så langt som livsstil, på jakt etter nye oppskrift ideer? Følg noen cateringfirmaer og se hva de kommer opp med. Trenger en vri for at cocktailparty? Twitter har folk for det også. Garderobe anbefalinger, eller bare ønsker å se hva andre mennesker gjør med sine liv? Det er alt der.<br/><br/>Det er noen vanlige utfordringer jeg står overfor når jeg snakker om dette, og de er legitime hindringer. Det kan virke ganske skremmende, spesielt hvis du kommer på bandwagon sent, som jeg gjorde. Jeg tilbrakte måneder med å følge bare to personer og ikke vite hva annet å gjøre. Men det er måter å overvinne dem, og høre at de er fra minst hyppige til de fleste.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter er for narsissistiske jerks<br/>Jeg tror dette kommer fra ideen om at de fleste tweeter for og om seg selv som en måte å få oppmerksomhet på. Det jeg ikke får er hvorfor det er noe galt med det, eller hvorfor det gjør en til en narsissist eller en idiot. Hvis noen har noe å si, vil de bli hørt. Tidligere ville du stå på gatehjørnet og rope. Nå kan du rope i 140 tegn eller mindre. Twitter er bare en ny måte å bli hørt på. Nå er det absolutt narsissistiske jerks på Twitter. De er overalt, noen ganger er folk idioter, noen ganger er en av dem meg, jeg er lei for å si det. Hvis du ikke liker hva noen sier, enten det er poeng at de gjør eller detaljerte kontoer av deres baderomsaktiviteter, trenger du ikke å lytte på Twitter.<br/><br/># 2 Jeg kan ikke holde styr på alt.<br/>Det andre hinderet folk ofte bringer opp er at de bare ikke har tid til å holde styr på alle de tingene som skjer på Twitter. Og vet du hva? Det er greit. Hold styr på hva du kan. Kanskje du bare vandrer på noen få dager. Hvis du er en privat bruker (i stedet for å tweete for firmaet ditt), og spesielt en nybegynner, er det greit. En del av noe er bedre enn ingenting.<br/><br/># 1 Jeg har ikke noe jeg vil sette ut der.<br/>Dette er langt den hyppigste utfordringen folk heve. Og det spiller ingen rolle. Du trenger ikke å bli med Twitter for å snakke. Bli med det å lytte. Igjen, dine favoritt forfattere, sangere, bloggere, og aviser er på her. Dette er din sjanse til å lytte til dem. Det er din sjanse til å få et vindu inn i deres liv og aktiviteter, og de inviterer deg til å gjøre det. Vil du finne ut hva Felicia Day kommer til å være opp til på San Diego Comic Con? Ferdig. Jeg kjenner folk som bare lytter på Twitter, og det er flott. Det er det jeg gjorde en stund. Til slutt finner du kanskje noe å tweet om, eller lage noe å tweet om. Jeg håper du gjør det, fordi jeg vil høre om det.<br/><br/>Kort sagt, hvis du ikke bruker Twitter, tror jeg du bør være. Hvis du ikke bruker den i sin fulle utstrekning, prøv å. Ikke vær redd for å følge fem hundre mennesker, hvis alle disse menneskene sier ting du er interessert i. Inviter disse menneskene inn i biter av livet ditt, og se hvordan det er forbedret av samspillet. Jeg ser frem til å høre fra deg. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>Selve tanken på å få en rotkanal setter de fleste på kanten. SCM Dental bruker den nyeste teknologien og teknikken til å gjøre en rotkanal til en praktisk talt smertefri og lav stressprosedyre.<br/><br/>Roterende endodontikk er en avansert teknologi og teknikk for å utføre endodontisk behandling, det kliniske begrepet for en rotkanalBegrepet "rotkanal" refererer til det naturlige hulrommet i midten av tannen. Tannens nerve er lokalisert i bløtvev (masse) inne i rotkanalen. Hvis tannen er skadet enten av traumer eller forfall, kan rusk komme inn i det følsomme rotkanalområdet og forårsake infeksjon, eller i ekstreme tilfeller, og abscess. En abscessed tann er svært alvorlig og bør behandles som en nødsituasjon, da det kan skape en infeksjon som kan spre seg til andre deler av kroppen. Hvis du tror du har en abscessed tann, kontakt vårt kontor umiddelbart for å planlegge nødhjelp.<br/><br/>Avhengig av saken, kan rotfyllebehandling kreve mer enn ett besøk. En innledende røntgen vil bli tatt for å evaluere tannen og rotfyllen og bestemme omfanget av skaden og infeksjonen hvis den er til stede. Du vil bli gitt en form for anestesi for å gjøre deg avslappet.<br/><br/>Når området er nummen, vil tannlegen lage et tilgangskammer til rotkanalen ved hjelp av et elektrisk håndstykke. Deretter vil rotkanalen bli skrapt av det infiserte eller skadede vevet og nerven. Når hele området har blitt grundig rengjort og polert, vil tannen bli fylt med en biokompatibel gummiforbindelse kalt gutta percha. Tannen er deretter dekket med en tannfylling eller tannkrone for å gjenopprette styrke og funksjon.<br/><br/>Endodontisk terapi har et dårlig rykte som en smertefull prosedyre. Med roterende endodontikk er en rotfyllingsprosedyre ikke mer smertefull enn å ha en tannfylling plassert. Infeksjonen og skade på nerven er det som skaper den ekstreme smerte og ubehag, og pasienter vil oppleve betydelig lindring etter å ha gjennomgått rotfyllingsterapi. Rotkanaler har en suksessrate på 95% og tillater folk å bevare sine naturlige tenner. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kirkegård Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood anmeldelser, Highgate<br/><br/>Nå kalt Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Mellom 1860 og 1880 ble senteret revet ut av City of London for å bygge kloakk, jernbane og nye veier. Hus ble revet uten hensyn til leietakerne som måtte finne den innkvartering de kunne andre steder. Ledere gikk til livo i Kensington og St. John's Wood, mens de fattigste overfylte i rookeries som Seven Dials og Lisson Grove. For de mellom, kontorister og dyktige arbeidere, spekulative byggherrer satt opp rad etter rad av rekkehus og Mr Pooter flyttet inn i Holloway. Folket i Muswell Hill så hus krype over feltene i Finsbury Park, opp Crouch Hill og ned på den andre siden, slik at i 1880 ble Crouch End utviklet, og det syntes ingen måte å dempe strømmen. Ti år senere ble de store eiendommene til Muswell Hill solgt. Upton Farm ble solgt og kirkelige kommissærer ønsket å utvikle Churchyard Bottom Wood, nå kalt Queen's Wood. Historien ville ha gjort et Ibsen-spill. To grupper av ærlige, høyt motiverte mennesker som kjemper for det de hver trodde var riktig. De kirkelige kommissærene på den ene siden og Hornsey Charities Committee på den andre, begge trodde de gjorde sitt beste for andre mennesker, og publikum reiste seg mot dem begge i indignasjon.<br/><br/>På den tiden var Muswell Hill Road en landevei, med Southwood Hall i den ene enden og Upton Farm i den andre. Ved 1894 ble Onslow Gardens bygget, Connaught Gardens markert ut, og utbyggere var klar til å utvikle Woodlands eiendom. Skjær ut av Churchyard Bottom Wood var en gruppe hytter på et trekantet sted. Et udatert kart, holdt av kirkelige kommissærer, viser seks Wasteland Cottages med en åpning mellom dem - ikke en vei, ikke metallisert, men en vei gjennom til jordbærsengene bak. Videre var det et annet gap som førte til gangstier gjennom skogen. Disse to åpningene skulle være grunnlaget for planen. De samme to hullene og den ryddede bakken, som var jordbærfeltet, kan sees på kartet 1894 nedenfor. De er vist som 'Muswell Hill Cottages' og, ganske i forbifarten, Peter Sellers skulle leve på samme sted mye senere. For å utvikle treet som en boligeiendom, måtte kommissærene kjøre to veier gjennom fra Muswell Hill Road og bygge hus langs dem. Muswell Hill Road-fronten alene ville ikke ha gitt plass til nok hus til å gjøre venture verdt.<br/><br/>Landet og hyttene hadde blitt gitt mye tidligere som almissehus for å huse gamle mennesker og ble holdt på deres vegne av Trustees of Hornsey Charity Commissioners. Ved 1890-tallet ble hyttene tumlet ned, i behov av større reparasjon. Offentlig-spirited, som ønsker å gjøre det beste for sine gamle leietakere, kunne Trustees ikke forbedre dem siden de ikke hadde penger. Noen år før de kirkelige kommissærene hadde planlagt å utvikle Gravel Pit Wood (nå Highgate Wood) som en boligeiendom, men dette hadde møtt slik motstand at de støttet seg. I stedet, i 1886, ga de alle 69 dekar skog til publikum. Samtidig tilbød de seg å selge Churchyard Bottom Wood til Hornsey Urban District Council for 25 000 pund, men dette var for mye for Hornsey å skaffe på egen hånd. Rådet sa at folk som bor utenfor Hornsey også likte skogen og andre myndigheter skulle hjelpe, men ingen hjelp ble gitt. Til slutt falt tilbudet i abei.<br/><br/>Kart som viser Muswell Hill Cottages som var sentrum for kontroversen.<br/><br/>Hotell i nærheten av Muswell Hill Road<br/><br/>Det synes sannsynlig at disse tre par hytter var de i sentrum av tvisten.<br/><br/>De kirkelige kommissærene ønsket å skaffe penger til sitt kirkearbeid i Storbritannia og i utlandet. De mente at de hadde fått landet til å bli brukt til propogation av religion, og hvis dette betydde å selge land eller skog, var det et mindre onde enn å begrense kirkens arbeid. De hadde gitt Grus Pit Wood til publikum: i stedet ville de utvikle Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Forvalterne av Hornsey Charities ønsket å produsere en inntekt for å hjelpe sine fattige mennesker, så de gjorde et tilbud til kommissærene. Deres trekantede stykke land var for vanskelig formet til å utvikles økonomisk, men hvis kommissærene ville gi dem litt mer land for å gjøre det til et firkantet sted, ville de bygge tjuefem pene villaer. Disse ville bringe inn grunnleier på £ 225 per år, som kunne brukes til å lindre fattigdommen til Hornsey-folk. Til gjengjeld ville de tillate kommisjonen å kutte to veier gjennom deres land slik at kommissærene kunne utvikle skogen.<br/><br/>Da dette tilbudet ble kjent, reagerte folk umiddelbart med alarm.<br/><br/>Den 16. desember 1893 spurte Carvell Williams parlamentsmedlem i Underhuset om de kirkelige kommissærene hadde gått med på å selge en stripe land til Hornsey Charities Trustees på betingelse av at en eksisterende vei ble utvidet til 40 fot, om dette var en innledende byggeplan og om House of Parliament ville ha mulighet til å uttrykke en mening.<br/><br/>Mr. Leveson Gower, en Church Estates kommissær svarte ', "Ja" til den første delen.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Forstår jeg at det er intensjonen å ødelegge den delen av Highgate Woods ved å bygge på den?"<br/><br/>To dager senere publiserte The Star en artikkel som var verdig enhver moderne tabloid.<br/><br/>Stjernen<br/>18 desember 1893<br/><br/>"Parlamentet må holde et våkent øye med de gamle vandaler og konføderater av jerry-byggeren de kirkelige kommissærer. De fremmedgjør alltid et stykke land eller favoriserer byggherrene i motsetning til allmennheten. Kommisjonærene ville ikke selge Churchyard Bottom-veden til skattebetalerne, men foreslår nå å "åpne den" ved å kutte to brede veier gjennom den i forbindelse med en av deres mange byggeplaner. Vil ikke noen stille et spørsmål i Stortinget og sjekke kommissærenes mursteins- og mørtelpolitikk?<br/><br/>Da dette ble trykt, hadde spørsmålet blitt stilt, og svaret var enten usant eller falskt. Andre papirer tok opp historien. Times, i en lang rapport, sa at Commisssioners ikke var forberedt på å gi et løfte om at parlamentet, eller noe annet offentlig organ, skulle ha mulighet til å vurdere noen plan for å bygge på stedet av treet.<br/><br/>Situasjonen fortsatte i atten måneder før de kirkelige kommissærene ble tvunget til å åpne en undersøkelse, som begynte ved Highgate den 31. mai 1895, ledet av en assisterende kirkelig kommisjonær. Undersøkelsen produserte en mengde avisbrev, hvorav dette var det viktigste.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5. juni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISME PÅ HØYGGATE<br/><br/>Sir -<br/><br/>Vil du hjelpe oss med å avverge det som ville være en katastrofe, ikke bare for det umiddelbare distriktet, men for hele det tett befolkede Nord-London? I ingen del av storbyen har byggherren vært mer aktiv enn i Crouch End og Hornsey. De vakre engene for et år eller to siden er nå hus og butikker. Ballasthauger har tatt plassen til statelige almer og kastanjer, og en gang hyggelige landsbyer deler skjebnen til Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury og Islington.<br/><br/>---- Objektet er bygging av to 40-fots veier gjennom skogen. Vi i dette distriktet vet betydningen av førti-fots veier gjennom skogen. Det betyr at skogen er dømt. For ti år siden reddet agitasjon søster-tre av seksti-fem dekar - The Grus Pit Woods - og ingen som så Bank Holiday folkemengder flokker opp Archway Road fra de kjedelige gatene i Holloway, Islington og Clerkenwell har alltid vært hele treverk, og så på den ivrige gleden av barna og familiefester som piknik på gresset og blant trærne. -----<br/><br/>De kirkelige kommissærene eier nesten en tredjedel av det store sognet Hornsey. Ved å bruke skattebetalernes penger på å åpne veiene og utvikle distriktet i sin alminnelighet, har verdien av deres eiendom økt enormt, og fra denne ufortjente økningen får de hvert år store inntekter. Sikkert skattebetalerne hvis penger har dermed hjulpet i å skape den enorme eiendom kan forvente liberal behandling i retur.<br/><br/>Din lydighet,<br/><br/>Signert av presten i St James', Muswell Hill, ministeren i Park Chapel, Crouch End, en barrister som bor i Onslow Gardens og tre medlemmer av distriktsrådet.<br/><br/>Det var et skudd rett over buene til de kirkelige kommissærene. Deres egne religiøse ledere og distriktsrådet, alle opp i våpen og sa i kraft at kirken var for rik og skulle være veldedig, ikke grådig. Innlemmelsen av de to prestene var et snedig trekk, men husk at dette fremdeles var på høyden av Darwin-striden. Darwin hadde en splittet tro på kirkens lære, og mange mennesker ville ha mislikt kirkens makt bare fra det synspunktet. Kirken var ikke så sikker som den lot til å være.<br/><br/>Kveldsnyhetene, 7. juni 1895, sa:<br/><br/>"Hvis de kirkelige kommisjonærer ikke blir taklet med en gang, vil bygningen blekksprut få et grep om treet som vil være svært vanskelig å løsne senere, ---. Derfor er det opp til londonere å være oppe og gjøre hvis de vil redde en av sine mest herlige biter av rustikk natur. Den offentlige etterforskningen er utsatt til neste torsdag, og før da må noe gjøres for å overbevise kommissærene om at innbyggerne i London ikke vil tolerere konfiskeringen av en av deres favoritt lekeplasser.<br/><br/>Et brev i Daily Chronicle neste dag sa:<br/><br/>.... Det var med stor lettelse at beboerne, for noen ti år siden, hørte at kjøpet av Øvre Wood hadde blitt gjennomført; og hvor herlig en velsignelse dette har vist seg, alle som besøkte dem kan vitne, men alle som anstrengte seg for å redde disse øvre skogene, som ligger på vestsiden av Muswell Hill-veien, følte at deres seier var ufullstendig så lenge de seksti hektar på østsiden forble i fare. Kan noen tvile på hva virkningen ville være hvis Churchyard Bottom Wood ble erstattet av rader med små villaer, som hver sender ut sitt bidrag av røyk og sot? Kan noen også tvile på den alvorlige forskjellen det ville gjøre for den pittoreske innstillingen til de kjøpte skogene hvis en linje med stirrende nye hus skulle kjøres opp rett over mot deres grønne fasade?<br/><br/>Dette uttrykte meningene til mange mennesker. Gravel Pit Wood, som forfatteren kaller "Upper Wood", hadde faktisk ikke blitt kjøpt, men gitt til distriktet av den kirkelige kommisjonen, et poeng de skulle gjenta gang på gang gjennom årene, men de fleste ignorerte det. Kommisjonen ville ikke gi bort et annet tre uansett hva noen sa, og holdt denne posisjonen til slutten.<br/><br/>H.S. Chamberlain, fra 5 Cranley Gardens, i et brev til Times datert 8. juni 1895, oppfordret til kjøp.<br/><br/>Jeg vet at det er vanlig å snakke hardt om de geistlige kommissærene, men som forvaltere av et fond er de forpliktet til å administrere det til den største fordel, og derfor, hvis noe skal gjøres for å redde nedbrytingen av treverket, ser det ut for meg at det allerede var en liten ting som kunne gjøres for et lite selskap.<br/><br/>(Dette refererer til Crouch End Playing Fields som hadde blitt sikret noen år senere.)<br/><br/>Som leder av Muswell Hill Conservative Association, er jeg i konstant kontakt med innbyggerne, og jeg kan trygt bekrefte at hver person bosatt i nabolaget ville gjøre noe i grunn til å bevare.<br/><br/>(Alt han personlig ønsket var veldedighetsinntekt for å støtte sitt fattige folk. Han krevde sin acre av land - ikke mye sikkert - han trodde kommissærenes forsikring om at skogen ikke var i fare.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road var en av de beste i Hornsey og ville forbli like vakker, hus eller ingen hus.<br/><br/>(Og så kom den store retoriske blomstringen.)<br/><br/>"Skal de fattige lide på grunn av de sentimentale innvendingene og det hysteriske ropet om 'ulv nettopp reist av dine korrespondenter? Noe må gjøres og det snart. En acre av backland lagt til veldedighetsboligen ville ikke gjøre noen merkbar forskjell for det gjenværende landet, mens overskuddet fra det ville hjelpe mange fattige gamle og verdige personer i deres fallende år og gjøre det mulig for oss å overlevere til våre etterfølgere en eiendom som i en fjern fremtid ville være av stor verdi i å gi veldedig hjelp til de verdige fattige i sognet Hornsey.<br/><br/>Lese brevet en sanser hysteri svært nær overflaten. Hvorfor trodde han kommissærene ønsket å bygge en vei? Hvorfor skal de bruke alle de pengene hvis ikke å bygge hus? Han syntes aldri å innse at for en hektar land ville hele treet gå tapt. Men han hadde vært med problemet i lang tid. Han var den personen som kommissærene hadde gjort tilbudet om salg for £ 25 000 år før, og det er hans navn som er æret i en plakett på Crouch End Clock Tower for å redde treet, men hans tillit til de kirkelige kommissærene virker naiv. Det er trist at han ved undersøkelsen skulle bli kastet som djevelen.<br/><br/>Undersøkelsen fortsatte<br/><br/>Den avsatte åpnet i Highgate den 15. juni 1895. I forventning om en stor samling hadde rådskammeret blitt fullstendig forandret. De vanlige bordene var fjernet og rommet fylt med stoler. Klokken halv sju var rommet overfylt, og folk løp rundt for å få sitteplasser.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, kommissæren, sa undersøkelsen var egentlig en enkel en. Hornsey Parochial Charities ønsket å kjøpe et stykke land som grenser til deres veldedighetseiendom på baksiden. Spørsmålet var om veldedighetskommisjonen, som kontrollerte alle veldedige organisasjoner, hadde nok makt til å stoppe dem. Kirkens kommissærer var forberedt på å selge landet på svært gunstige vilkår, og inntektene til veldedigheten ville bli svært betydelig økt.<br/><br/>Mot dette var det tre klasser av innvendinger.<br/><br/>Den opprinnelige tilliten var for å gi hytter til de fattige, men forvalterne foreslo å bygge villaer som ville være for dyrt for de fattige. Imidlertid var det innenfor forvalternes makt å variere vilkårene for tilliten, slik at de kunne bygge villaer hvis de trodde at de fattige ville ha nytte til slutt. De fattige kunne selv protestere, men liberale bestemmelser hadde allerede blitt lovet for dem. Den tredje innvendingen var relatert til den estetiske og offentlige siden av spørsmålet. Han tok det ut fra det han hadde lest at veldedighetskommisjonen burde gripe inn for å hindre de kirkelige kommisjonærene i å utøve sitt eget skjønn når det gjaldt å ta seg av sin egen eiendom.<br/><br/>Undersøkelsen drøftet fine punkter, men talerne fortsatte å komme tilbake til det store problemet med å forhindre ødeleggelse av treet. Vestry Clerk of Islington, som representerte 300 000 mennesker, gjorde en formell protest om hvilken som helst del av skogen, så verdifull for folket i Islington og Hornsey som ble brukt til private formål. Wilfred White sa at hvis kommissærene ville gi dem tid, ville de kunne samle inn penger for å kompensere tillitsmennene.<br/><br/>Beaumont sa at de ikke ville ha villaer, de ville ha hytter for fattige mennesker som ble drevet ut av distriktet. Andre sa at det ikke var penger til å bygge hytter for å erstatte de nåværende forfalne, men villaer ville være et økonomisk forslag. Andre sa at det var mange villaer å leie inn i Highgate. Treet var hellig. Hold deg til spørsmålet om skogen.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher sa at ropet blant arbeiderne var at det ikke var noe sted å gå. Arbeidere kom til ham med ropet: "Vi er drevet ut av Highgate og er forpliktet til å gå til Highgate New Town." Hvis Muswell Hill Road-fronten ble solgt, var det ingen tvil om at veiene kunne kuttes rett gjennom skogen i retning Hornsey, men hvis kommissærene ikke kunne få landet fra Charity Commission, kunne de ikke kutte veien.<br/><br/>Han var veldig sikker på at hyttene kunne settes i en egnet tilstand av reparasjon. Han ble spurt av de fattige, av politiet og av en rekke av de arbeidende klasser for å representere disse to punktene, at hytta innkvartering var svært sårt trengte i Highgate, og at hvis de en gang tillot landet å bli solgt, var det ingen indikasjon på hvor hånden til byggherren ville bli holdt.<br/><br/>(Høy og langvarig jubel).<br/><br/>Tallrike andre mennesker talte, og kommissæren oppsummerte det ved å si at han tok det for gitt at den rådende mening var i favør av å beholde hyttene, men møtet skulle ikke trekke noen konklusjoner fra det han hadde sagt (Groans).<br/><br/>Andre sa at forvalterne av Charity hadde mislyktes i sine plikter ved å la hyttene falle i forfall.<br/><br/>H.R. Williams, forvalteren som hadde skrevet til avisen tidligere, sa at han hadde den beste autoritet til å si at Kirkens kommissærer ikke ville lage noen veier i det hele tatt, og at de ikke ville ha noen fordel av veldedighetskommisjonærenes handlinger. Andre var langt mindre tillitsfulle, og møtet ble avsluttet etter nesten tre timer.<br/><br/>Vi står overfor det faktum at i Highgate og Muswell Hill er det en rekke personer som vil ha Churchyard Bottom Wood og vil ikke være fornøyd før de har fått det - mens ingen ser ut til å være villige til å bruke en farthing å betale for det. Alle sier at det ville være fint å ha treet som åpen plass, men alle synes det er noen andres plikt å gjøre det til en. Islington Vestry har "løst" på emnet, men Islington Vestry tilbyr ikke en penny stykke mot kjøpet. "Det er ikke noe vanskeligere problem for samfunnet eller den enkelte å løse enn hvordan man får besittelse av andres eiendom uten å betale for det."<br/><br/>Å betale for det var faktisk problemet da Churchyard Bottom Wood ble gjenstand for intens lokal og nasjonal debatt. En felles komité ble dannet for å samle inn penger for å redde treet. 20. november 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, skrev til The Standard, en avis på den tiden, og ba om hjelp. Han minnet alle om faren for å miste treet og sa at det bare kunne reddes ved å kjøpe det. Kirkens kommissærer ville selge for £ 25 000 og en ekstra (5000 ville være nødvendig for fekting og drenering, noe som gjorde totalt £ 30 000. Dette var for mye for Hornsey Council å heve, men de hadde allerede stemt £ 10 000 mot det totale. Skogen var av uvurderlig verdi for hele Nord-London, så han appellerte til offentlige organer og privatpersoner om å skaffe de resterende 20 000 pundene. Han advarte om at det nåværende tilbudet fra kirkens kommissærer bare var åpent til slutten av 1898. Etter det flyttet byggherrene inn.<br/><br/>Appellen ble ønsket hjertelig velkommen av pressen. En privat Bill ble rushed gjennom parlamentet og Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, ble lov. Conunittee hadde nå rett til å annonsere for bidrag til å kjøpe Wood og bevare den.<br/><br/>I løpet av ganske kort tid ble nesten alle pengene samlet inn, men de siste tusen viste seg å være svært vanskelig å skaffe, og kommissærenes frist var et spørsmål om uker unna. Cory-Wright ba om mer tid, men fikk bare tre måneder, og da bare hvis renter på 4 prosent ble betalt for den ekstra perioden på hele beløpet. Til slutt gjorde London County Council, som opprinnelig hadde tilbudt £ 2.500, dette opp til £ 5000, og totalen ble nådd, men det var en tett ting.<br/><br/>Rådet bestemte seg for å endre navnet til «Queen's Woods» til ære for dronning Victorias Diamantjubileum og Hornsey satte på en fin oppvisning av bunting da hertuginnen av Albany formelt erklærte treet åpent «for fri bruk av publikum for alltid».<br/><br/>Mens kampanjen for å redde Churchyard Bottom Wood ble drevet og regissert av lokalbefolkningen som følte lidenskapelig om dette bestemte stykke skog, ba de om hjelp og erfaring fra et stort nettverk av mennesker, hvorav noen hadde jobbet sammen på lignende kampanjer i over tretti år. Komiteen utstedte en appell, trykt på papir av meget god kvalitet og med noen kjente navn.<br/><br/>Spørsmålene om åpen plass og folkehelse var store emner i den viktorianske visjonen.<br/><br/>Bevegelsen for åpne plasser<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, den store boligreformatoren, som hadde begynt med tre gamle hus i Marylebone, kjøpt for henne av Jolm Ruskin, hadde raskt blitt en ekspert på å huse fattige mennesker i de sunneste forholdene mulig. Hennes måte var å kjøpe leieavtaler og deretter slå ned noen av de overfylte husene for å bringe lys og luft til resten, og trodde at frisk luft og sollys var den eneste måten fattige mennesker kunne bli reddet fra 'råtne feber. Hun hadde lært dette som barn fra sin bestefar, Southwood Smith, som utviklet sine teorier ved Fever Hospital ved King's Cross.<br/><br/>Han hadde bygget de første industrielle boliger for fattige mennesker og hadde statistisk bevist at god luft og anstendig drenering reddet liv. Gibson Gardens, i Northwold Road, er et direkte resultat av Southwood Smiths ideer. Mer informasjon om Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Viktigheten av åpen luft<br/><br/>Åpen plass og muligheten til å puste ren luft, var avgjørende for folk som bor i en eller to overfylte rom. Octavia Hill tok sine kostnader fra Lisson Grove slummen, opp Fitzjohns Avenue til Hampstead Heath. Hun elsket Fitzjohn's Avenue-feltene så mye at hun prøvde å kjøpe dem som en offentlig park. De skulle koste £ 10 000 og innen tre uker i august hadde £ 8 500 blitt samlet inn. Det trengte bare slutten av sommerferien og retur fra ferie sympatiske venner og ytterligere £ 1.500 ville ha blitt samlet inn, men eierne plutselig trakk sitt tilbud. Til tross for all bønn, ble feltene dekket med store hus.<br/><br/>Fra dette utviklet kampanjen for å redde Parliament Hill, den neste åpne plassen nordover fra Lisson Grove, og kjøpte opp felt i veien for byggherrene for å lage en permanent cordon sanitalre mot de fremrykkende mursteinene. Parliament Hill Fields-kampanjen var så vellykket at Hampstead Heath Bill ble vedtatt, og det var penger over fra appellen. Fra disse pengene og drivkraften mot åpne rom, var å utvikle National Trust. Octavia Hill hadde vært interessert i å beskytte områder som Church Bottom Wood i mange år, så hun var en naturlig alliert i kampen for å redde Wood.<br/><br/>Commons Preservation Society var også kjent med denne typen agitasjon og pengeinnsamling. De hadde revet ned fekting da herrene av herregården hadde omsluttet deler av felles land, og ledet både lovlige og ulovlige kamper mot den arrogante privatiseringen av land som tradisjonelt var gratis. Robert Hunter, deres æresadvokat fra 1868, var alltid opptatt av å sikre åpne rom, store eller små, for publikum. Han, nå Sir Robert Hunter, ble formann for Kirkens Bottom Appeal. Formannen i Commons Preservation Society var Shaw-Lefevre MP (senere Lord Eversley) som spilte en stor rolle i denne og andre kampanjer i Underhuset. Octavia Hill hadde vært involvert i sitt arbeid fra rundt 1875.<br/><br/>Samtidig var Octavia Hill kampanje for en begravelsesregning.<br/><br/>Bykirkegårder var blitt så fulle og en så alvorlig helsefare, ved å forurense brønner som folk trakk sitt drikkevann fra, at byens begravelser ikke lenger var tillatt. I stedet ble det opprettet kirkegårder i utkanten av byen. Abney Park Cemetery var en av disse. Det var da en bevegelse for å fjerne gravsteinene til kantene av gamlebyen kirkegårder, re-inter mellom likene andre steder og slå kirkegårder i hager og åpne områder, i stedet for å bygge på dem. Dette landet i sentrum av London var svært verdifullt og spekulanter var ivrige etter å få det: selv kvekerne hadde bygget over en av deres kirkegårder og truet med å gjøre det igjen ved å bygge over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill hadde et nettverk av allierte i et dusin felt, så hennes hjelp til å redde Church Bottom Wood må ha vært uvurderlig.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, som ble opprettet i 1882, hadde lagt ut om lag to hundre små hager i bysentre i 1890. De overlot dem senere til de lokale myndighetene, slik at deres støtte til Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal var sikret fra starten.<br/><br/>Kyrleforeningen er glemt nå, men hadde i sin tid stor innflytelse på byplanlegging og Open Space-lovgivning. Foreningen ble stiftet omkring 1875 for å skape farge og interesse i livene til mennesker som lever i kjedelige, kjedelige omgivelser. Lyse farger på vegger og dekorasjoner, god sang, åpne plasser, natur, litteratur og kunst. Alle disse hørte inn under Selskapets ansvarsområde: Det var en dekorativ avdeling, som William Morris holdt foredrag for; en musikkavdeling for å fremme kor og glade kvelder for folk i lokale skolebygninger; og en litteraturavdeling. Selskapet appellerte jevnlig i brev i The Times til «de rikere klassene» om at bøker og tidsskrifter skulle distribueres til gutte- og jenteklubber, almissehus og andre steder. Open Spaces-komiteen var imidlertid den mest aktive. Selve navnet «Kyrle» kom fra pavens The Man of Ross, filantropen som ga sitt fødested til folket som en offentlig park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Med Thanksgiving rundt hjørnet, her er noen festlige filmappespill vi laget for jentene. Begge Thanksgiving-spillene fokuserer på matteferdigheter. Og jeg er takknemlig igjen til mannen min, Ed, for å lage alt utklippet for meg.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Mønster Making<br/><br/>Som navnet sier, handler dette spillet om å lage mønstre. Små som bare lærer om mønstre, kan bare matche bildene på mønsterstrimlene, mens andre kan fortsette mønsteret med bildekortene på de tomme stripene.<br/><br/>For å lage filmappen, vil du kutte ut rutenettet av bilder for å lage kortstykkene. Jeg anbefaler å laminere dem for å hjelpe dem med å vare lenger. Lim deretter mønsterstrimlene ned på filmappen.<br/><br/>Jeg ville også ha de blanke mønsterstrimlene slik at jentene kunne se hvor de skulle fortsette mønsteret og hvor mange de skulle legge ut. Jeg festet dem til siden av mappen ved hjelp av tape, slik at de kunne brette seg inn for å pakke opp spillet og utvide til å legge mønsteret.<br/><br/>Jeg la også til en ekstra blank en slik at jentene kunne lage sitt eget mønster også.<br/><br/>Tyrkia nummer spillet<br/><br/>I dette spillet legger jentene til fjærene til kalkunkroppen mens de praktiserer telling og nummergjenkjenning. Jeg brukte de fargeløse fjærene til å fungere som en guide for hvor du skal legge til fjærene og slik at jentene kunne matche tallene. Og vær sikker på at når du limer ned kalkunkroppen, limer du bare i midten slik at vingestykkene kan glide under kroppen.<br/><br/>Når alle fjærene er lagt ut, praktiserer vi noen enkle aritmetiske, for eksempel å ta bort tre fjær og se hvor mange som er igjen, og legg deretter til to tilbake for å se hva det tilsvarer.<br/><br/>I tillegg til svarte og hvite vinger, inkluderte vi også en fargeløs kalkun i tilfelle du vil at de små skal fargelegge sitt eget sett. I stedet for et filmappespill kan du gjøre dette til et håndverk, farge brikkene, kutte dem ut og lime dem sammen.<br/><br/>Et annet alternativ er å bruke brikkene til å lage en filtbretthistorie. Vi synger noen ganger en kalkunversjon av 10 små indianere:<br/><br/>Slik som dette:<br/><br/>Hvem er jeg?<br/><br/>Jeg tror det er her jeg skal si noe vittig om meg selv. Å vel. Jeg er en hjemmeværende mor til tre fantastiske barn - våre tvillingdøtre som er syv nå og en to år gammel sønn som er full av energi. I mitt pre-barn liv var jeg lærer og jeg nå homeschool våre barn. Jeg er også gift med Ed, som for tiden tjenestegjør i luftforsvaret, og er mitt livs kjærlighet (det ville være vanskelig hvis han ikke var). Familien vår er stor på bøker, håndverk og å ha det gøy sammen. Jeg trodde bare at jeg ville dele våre aktiviteter i mitt eget lille hjørne av internett.<br/><br/>Zoe ser ut til å ha alt - rik, kjekk mann, lett New York liv - men hun gjorde feil i sin fortid, og de feilene kommer opp igjen i sitt nye liv. Jeg fant meg selv på kanten av setet mitt for det meste av boken og ble overrasket...<br/><br/>Jeg elsket denne boken, jeg elsker historien, og jeg er takknemlig Margot Shetterly brakte den frem i lyset. Min eneste klage var at jeg ønsket at hun diskuterte Katherine Johnsons rolle i de senere oppdragene litt mer, men jeg antar at historien måtte ende som ...<br/><br/>Jeg ønsket å like denne boken, og jeg gjorde gjennom det meste av det.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkoholbruk av personer under 21 år har blitt identifisert som et stort folkehelseproblem. Studier bemerker at det øker risikoen for funksjonshemming, og kan være skadelig for den utviklende hjernen. Mindreårige som drikker er mer sannsynlig å begå selvmord, bryte loven, eller være ofre for vold. Alkohol er involvert i nesten en tredjedel av ungdoms trafikk dødsfall. Den totale årlige kostnaden for mindreårige drikking er anslått til $62 milliarder kroner. Mens de fleste lover ment å hindre mindreårige drikking er vedtatt på statlig nivå, har det vært lovgivningsaktivitet og interesse på føderalt nivå for å støtte staters innsats for å dempe problemet. Denne rapporten beskriver omfanget av alkoholbruk blant mindreårige, nylig lovgivningsaktivitet på dette området og ulike politiske implikasjoner. Den vil bli oppdatert etter hvert som nye data blir tilgjengelige. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite.

Det var ikke politisk lobbyvirksomhet eller offentlig petisjon som resulterte i matreform, men heller en grasrotinnsats ledet av borgere med makt til å faktisk implementere og følge gjennom med endring.<br/><br/>Jeg avsluttet innlegget med å hentyde til ett spørsmål: Hvorfor er det så vanskelig for oss å gjøre dette selv, som enkeltpersoner? Hvis et helt land kan implementere og spre et felles syn på mat, hvorfor kan vi ikke?<br/><br/>Det er ingenting som egentlig stopper oss fra å etterligne Danmarks suksess. Problemet er, vi er oversvømmet med så mange meldinger om hva vi skal spise, og hvordan vi skal leve, det er vanskelig å vite hvor du skal begynne. Så i stedet for å følge vellykkede rammer som har vist seg å fungere (som det nordiske matmanifestet), hopper de fleste fra diettmani til diettmani, og prøver å finne den "riktige måten å spise på."<br/><br/>Men hvordan lyktes Claus Meyer? Hva var den hemmelige sausen som hjalp Manifestet til å ta tak? Og er det rimelig å tro at vi kan bruke disse leksjonene til våre egne liv?
