| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Mens du anerkjenner at det er umulig å argumentere for at noen elsker noe de hater, og omvendt, er det fortsatt ofte hyggelig å prøve argumentet. Når vi snakker med folk hvis meninger direkte motsier våre, blir vi tvunget til å forsvare vår smak, definere våre meninger og analysere hvorfor vi reagerer slik vi gjør. Derfor har vi Why Don't You Like This?, hvor to av våre medarbeidere vil forsøke å finne ut om folk med motstridende meninger kan komme forbi "Nei, du har feil!" og ha en sivil, konstruktiv og muligens til og med overbevisende diskusjon om deres stridspunkter. For uansett hva talk radio sier, er det fortsatt en mellomting mellom "Vi er helt enige" og "Jeg har rett, og du er dum og ond."<br/><br/>Scott: Siden vi diskuterte min Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World frafall, har vi vært på utkikk etter en sak der jeg kan ringe deg ut for ikke å like noe fantastisk, og vi trengte ikke å lete lenge. Vi satt rett ved siden av hverandre under Martin Scorsese's Hugo - meg, helt fortryllet av sin fantastiske hyllest til underverkene i tidlig stumfilm, og du, tilsynelatende motstå det ved hver tur. Kritisk konsensus har vært på min side: Det traff nr. 9-plassen på vår kollektive topp 15 (selv om du oppførte det som ditt overvurderte valg), har vunnet (eller plassert) i ulike filmkritiske priser, og har for tiden en 83-poengsum på Metacritic. Det betyr ikke at du tar feil, selvfølgelig, men det er opp til deg å forklare hvorfor Hugo var, med dine ord, "hul og kunstig", hvor mange av oss så det som en nydelig fremkalling av Scorseses barndom og medium da det fortsatt var i sin barndom. Og vær forsiktig når du river denne sommerfuglen fra hverandre ved vingene.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Tasha: Jeg kan ikke være forsiktig, Scott. Noen ganger gjør det mindre vondt hvis du river Band-Aid av alt på en gang. (Og selv om det ikke gjør det, hvem vil gå rundt iført en halvrevet Band-Aid? Brutto.) Faktum er at jeg fant Hugo å være en slitsomt manipulerende øvelse i forfalskning, fra åpningen glir gjennom en togstasjon i Paris, som minnet meg mer enn noe av Robert Zemeckis 'The Polar Express. I motsetning til Mike D'Angelo, er jeg en fan av lang, ubrutt tar som en måte å etablere et rom og oppmuntre seerne til å ubevisst holde pusten som et kamera utforsker et område; men når plassen som utforskes er en glatt, skinnende CGI-skapelse, og kameraet flyter vektløst gjennom det uten fysisk følelse av at enten kameraet eller omgivelsene er noen virkelig der, begynner det å spille en video. Og resten av filmen føltes like porøs og uvirkelig for meg, både når det gjelder innstillingen og når det gjelder den svært konstruerte, maudlin-historien.<br/><br/>Jeg har ikke nødvendigvis et problem med produserte, stiliserte miljøer i film. Jeg elsket Baz Luhrmanns like spredte, helt kunstige syn på Paris i Moulin Rouge, for eksempel, men den filmen har en følelse av sin egen latterlighet, en sans for humor om hvor bevisst over-the-top det er. Ditto stiliseringen av Jean-Pierre Jeunet, spesielt i Amélie. (Både Jeunet og Luhrmann føltes som sterke visuelle påvirkninger her.) Jeg fikk imidlertid følelsen av at Martin Scorsese ville at jeg skulle ta Hugo helt på alvor. Selv om det er enda en smertefullt sentimental historie om en foreldreløs som bringer farge tilbake til livet til en sur gammel curmudgeon. Og jeg kunne bare ikke.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Det er ingenting jeg liker mer i film enn å bli overrasket. Og det er ingenting jeg misliker og motstår mer enn å bli åpenbart manipulert, blir høyt fortalt hva du skal føle og når du skal føle det. En god film gjør denne typen ting subtilt; en dårlig bruker krasjende musikksignaler og søte strenger - og i dette tilfellet en uskikkelig, storøyd, disheveled foreldreløs stirrer elendig på kameraet - for å kreve patos, og for å fortelle seerne at de er forferdelige mennesker hvis de ikke serverer det på etterspørsel. Når det er sagt, kan jeg håndtere triste barn og gretten voksne som gjør livet bedre for hverandre - jeg gravde virkelig årets Le Havre, som i hovedsak var det samme plottet uten all søtheten - men jeg finner de kunstige miljøene reflekterer dårlig på de kunstige følelsene, og hver får den andre til å virke mer falsk etter tur.<br/><br/>La oss starte med det. I vår oversett filmvideo tok du og Noel begge Keith til oppgaven for å kjempe Tyrannosaur, fordi du følte at det ikke var realistisk nok - for konstruert, for elendig, for mye, for langt. Hvordan er det mulig at du ikke kan kjøpe en stymied gammel krank som bryter ting når han er sint, men du kan kjøpe en foreldreløs bor inne i en gigantisk jernbanestasjon klokke og begir seg ut på en lunefull reise for å reparere en mystisk automat som han mener kan bære hemmeligheter fra sin døde far, men som i stedet fører ham på en quirky reise av selvoppdagelse, inn i det magiske landet kino? Har du aldri funnet Hugos glorete rokokkodesign, aggressive hjertestrengsplukking eller trillebår-laster av quirky selv litt overdreven eller vanskelig å svelge?<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet og Luhrmann som påvirkninger på Scorsese?! Glem å være uhøflig, nå er du bevisst å stikke meg med en skarp pinne. Hvis du leter etter inspirasjon for Hugo - faktisk, hvis du leter etter den emosjonelle kjernen til Hugo - må du gå tilbake til Scorseses barndom på Elizabeth Street i Little Italy, hvor en astmatisk liten gutt, ikke i stand til å leke ute med de andre barna, trakk seg tilbake til Alexander Korda-fantasier som The Thief of Bagdad. Eller rettere sagt, gå rett til kilden selv: George Méliès, hvis A Trip To The Moon forblir Big Bang av alle filmfantasier, det øyeblikket da kameraet ikke ble brukt til å dokumentere verden som den er, men uansett lunefull, magisk, transporterende sted en filmskaper ønsker å oppfinne for det. Og den tradisjonen har blitt utviklet og utvidet i flere tiår før slike som Jeunet og Luhrmann fikk sine skitne små poter på den.<br/><br/>Og snakker om Jeunet, fint forsøk på å ta bort min retoriske våpen, men jeg vil si det uansett: Hvordan kan du elske Amélie, men finne Hugo syntetisk og "overdreven" og "kjedelig manipulerende"? Du sier at Amélie og Moulin Rouge har forløst «følelsen av [sin] egen latterlighet» der Scorsese mener at vi skal ta Hugo på alvor, og jeg tror ikke det er tilfelle, i hvert fall på det siste punktet. At Scorsese har en åpenbar lidenskap for filmene er vel derfor du tolker Hugo som selvopptatt, men for meg er det følelsene som gir filmen en følelsesmessig ballast som Luhrmann- og Jeunet-filmene ikke har. Alle tre filmene gjør aggressiv bruk av underverkene til CGI - og Scorsese legger til 3D til blandingen, til en fantastisk effekt - men hvor du og jeg er forskjellige, er på spørsmålet om vektløshet. Jeg er enig i at CGI har en distanserende effekt; verdener som består utelukkende av digital plasticine er fleksible til det punktet hvor de noen ganger ikke har noen tilstedeværelse. Du refererte til Hugo i din "Overrated" -oppføring for vårt beste av filmstykke som "en CGI gimcrack" - en perfekt dis ... for en annen film.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Det er rimelig å si at Scorsese har bygget Hugo rundt et standardproblem, "hjertestrengsplukkende" barnebok / film plot: Orphan savner sin far, skaper sin egen lille fantasiverden, gloms på en ny venn, overbeviser en crusty gammel fuddy-duddy å myke opp og kanskje adoptere ham. Men det er bare det narrative skjelettet, og Scorsese gir mye kjøtt og blod. For det første kan du ikke se Hugo, den ensomme gutten, kikke ut fra klokketårnene til kjas og mas på en togstasjon i Paris uten å tenke på Scorsese, en annen ensom gutt, stirrer ut av soveromsvinduet på Elizabeth Street. Og selv om du ikke er en stor nok filmnerd til å gjøre den forbindelsen, føler jeg at Hugos reise ikke er å finne en ny farsfigur, men å fortsette med den mekaniske magien som står som sin egen fars arv. Det er hva film er: Vedvarende visjon som tillater oss å akseptere en illusorisk versjon av verden på 24 bilder per sekund er vitenskap og magi på en gang. Hugos forhold til Méliès handler ikke om at han koser seg til en ny pappa, men at han deler en felles entusiasme som den gamle mannen har nedsenket i bitterhet. For meg er det en langt mer unik vinkel på et potensielt butikkslitent premiss.<br/><br/>Selv filmens få kritikere ser ut til å være villige til å innrømme at sekvensene som fremkaller filmhistorien og Méliès studio - med Michael Stuhlbarg som den heroiske filmforskeren! - var kjempebra. Det føltes, på best mulig måte, som en berusende komprimering av min History Of Film 101-klasse i college, kondenserer et semesters verdi av klipp og kontekst til noe mellom en montasje og en animert popup-bok. Og det taler til den geniale utformingen av filmen, som lagene faktum og fantasi så vakkert at det er på en gang en historie om Méliès og fødselen av kino, og bare den slags enkle, overdådig produsert filmatisk rart at Scorsese selv ville ha elsket som barn. Heldigvis følger ikke Hugo Jeunet/Luhrmann-modellen og har «en følelse av sin egen latterlighet». Som en fantasikjenner selv, vil du ikke si at det er verdt å spille det rett og oppriktig og ubeskjedent i stedet for å blinke på publikum? Du kan finne Hugo sykelig søt, men jeg tror ikke ektheten av sin følelse er å bli nektet.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Tasha: Ja, jeg fant faktisk deler av Hugo fortryllende. (Merk hvordan jeg svarer på spørsmålet ditt foran, mens du var for opptatt med å skumme med apopleksi for å adressere min, selv om jeg antar at det er et svar i seg selv. Ok, "innflytelse" kan overdrive saken - jeg mente bare at den visuelle stilen så veldig kjent ut. Men som Keith påpekte da du tok opp dette personlig, er Scorsese verken imot å trekke inspirasjon fra andres visuelle, eller immun mot det.) Først og fremst var jeg fortryllet av de delene som handlet om Georges Méliès' bakgrunnshistorie, med hans kjærlighet til film, med arbeidet han la inn i sin kunst og gleden han fikk ut av det. Det er mye skjønnhet og moro i iscenesettelsen av undervannsbanen fra Méliès 'Fairyland', og i sekvensen på slutten, med fokus på Méliès-opptak. Jeg skal innrømme at Hugos forbindelse med Méliès over en felles forkjærlighet for film er en fin detalj, og jeg liker en god film om filmskaping.<br/><br/>Men Hugo handler ikke først og fremst om film, til tross for Méliès-tilknytningene. I tillegg til temaene du siterer, handler det også om å finne din hensikt, som karakterene uttrykkelig forklarer hverandre og til oss. Og det handler om skuespill, og store actionsett, og jager, og lykkelig-evig-etter-avslutninger hvor selv den sinte mobberen og det sjenerte eldre paret og fergawdsakes selv den grettene dachshunden alle blir parret med sjarmerende kjærlighetsinteresser på slutten. Den handler om Hermine Grang-typen som er sjefete, klønete og flink til å prise de magiske verdenene som er innkapslet i bøker, og hele denne virksomheten er veldig kjent og veldig kunstig.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese leker med arketyper. Problemet er, jeg følte aldri at han gjennomsyret dem med noe nytt, friskt eller troverdig, til tross for sin egen bakgrunnshistorie. Jeg ville ha foretrukket en historie om en ung Scorsese som vokste opp med astma - noe småskala og ekte, uten store rom fulle av CGI-urverk og gylne glødende støvmoter og profetiske drømmer og en rasende voksen tyrannvakt med et hjerte av gull - alt det overdimensjonerte, over-the-top tull. Du fortsetter å sitere Scorseses personlige bakgrunn og kjærlighet til film som bevis på at han virkelig føler det han legger på skjermen, men jeg føler ikke hans personlige berøring i noe av dette, bortsett fra de øyeblikkene som er eksplisitt om film. Kjernefølelsene kan være ekte, men det gjør ikke utførelsen mindre falsk.<br/><br/>Du sier at ektheten av følelsene ikke kan nektes. Jeg tviler ikke på om Scorsese personlig følte seg ensom og isolert som barn, men jeg føler ikke ensomhet og isolasjon på skjermen - jeg ser en haug med overdrevne signifikanser (Hugo er skitten og klærne hans er slitt og alle de voksne roper på ham og han blir regelmessig jaget av en skummel hund!) og store beats, med roper og gråter og gråter. For meg er oppriktighet mer overbevisende og mer personlig når det er stille og direkte; Når noen roper sine meninger på meg, antar jeg at han enten er veldig sint, eller bare prøver å overvelde mine sanser for å holde meg fra å uttrykke min egen mening. Hugo var en lang rop, så vidt jeg var bekymret.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Hvorfor fikk jeg ikke den følelsen av falskhet fra Amélie? Jeg vil helt anerkjenne at Amélie og Moulin Rouge er både store, manipulerende, kunstige konstruksjoner i nøyaktig samme åre, krevende spesifikke følelser med bestemte intervaller, og prøver å selge de følelsene med tung følelsesladet og aggressivt lydspor prodding. Ingen av dem virkelig solgt meg på sine følelser som autentisk menneskelig følelse. Det jeg likte i disse to filmene var konstruksjonen - spesielt Amélies berusende, latterlige lister over tilfeldige karakteriseringer og erfaringer for skuespillerne, og Moulin Rouges musikalske magpie-mashups og rekontekstualiseringer. Jeg blir ofte solgt på historier som gjør kreative eller ambisiøse ting med struktur, og begge disse filmene kvalifiserer, der Hugo er en mye mer lineær, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>Men til slutt, for meg, kommer det virkelig ned til en følelse av at disse filmene er goofs, mens Hugo er ment å bli tatt på alvor i hvert eneste øyeblikk. Du tror ikke det er sant - men du forsvarer samtidig sin integritet når det gjelder dens helt autentiske, rotfestede-i-Scorsese-historie-følelse, og forteller meg at jeg tar feil, og han mener ikke at det skal tas seriøst. Hvordan forener du disse to uttalelsene? Hva om filmen antyder for deg at det ikke er ment å bli tatt på pålydende? Og er det mulig at dette bare er en annen nysgjerrig sak av Benjamin Button-lignende situasjon der jeg finner bruken av barn i store budsjettfilmer for å være i stor grad sappy og melodramatisk, mens du som far finner det omgår din kynisme og går rett til din familiefølelse?<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Scott: Ikke sikker på at jeg mente at Scorsese ikke mener å bli tatt på alvor; det er bare at han har valgt et lunefullt kjøretøy for å uttrykke en seriøs kjærlighet til filmene. Når du sier, "Men Hugo handler ikke primært om film, til tross for Méliès-bindingene," er jeg mystifisert. Jeg innrømmer at du finner mange elementer av Hugo altfor kjent og arbeidskrevende og full av Spielbergian wonder-emoting - det er ingenting jeg kan gjøre for å argumentere rundt den oppfatningen, som andre Hugo-tvilere deler. Noen ganger betyr en film å sjarmere og fortrylle, og det gjør det ikke for noen; du har Hugo og jeg har Amélie, selv om jeg tror sistnevnte, bevisst kunstig som det er, betyr for oss å finne det romantisk. (Snarere enn, si, noen forferdelige mekaniske contraption passer for en Saw oppfølger.)<br/><br/>Men å si at Hugo ikke først og fremst handler om film? Hvis det ikke handler om film, så er det den mest meningsløst diskursive historien om [hva du tror det handler om] jeg noen gang har sett. Forholdet mellom Hugo og Méliès er hjertet i filmen, og i hjertet av det er ikke bare noen lagerforbindelse mellom Plucky Orphan og Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, men en felles affinitet for konstruert magi - spesielt filmens magi. Jeg tror Scorsese og hans samarbeidspartnere har funnet en måte å uttrykke sin entusiasme over de tidlige dagene av kino gjennom en fantasi som er tilgjengelig for alle aldre. Den arketypefylte barnefortellingen er bare skorpen her; kino er kaken. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Når det gjelder The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, ser jeg ikke mye av en sammenheng, annet enn å prøve å avsløre meg som en Benjamin Button-forsvarer som en måte å skade min troverdighet på. (Forresten, hvordan er statister på den G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Jeg har sagt til deg at den søvnberøvede nye faren i meg kanskje var sårbar for Benjamin Button, men jeg kan ikke forestille meg en tid da forutsetningen om aldring i revers ikke ville bevege meg. Og dessuten ser jeg ikke hvordan Benjamin Button forholder seg mye til Hugo som en film om barn, siden det bare er et lite segment av en historie som spenner over en mye større bane.<br/><br/>Så har jeg overbevist deg? Sannsynligvis ikke. Men jeg er glad for å høre at Hugo ikke var helt blottet for fortryllelser for deg. Sekvensene på Méliès filmskaperen er det som satte Hugo over for meg - og i det minste kan vi dele litt filmkjærlighet.<br/><br/>Annonse<br/><br/>Tasha: Nei, jeg kan ikke si at du har overbevist meg, mer enn jeg har overbevist deg. Det er umulig å argumentere noen inn i en visceral kjærlighet til noe, og det burde virkelig være like umulig å snakke noen ned fra visceral kjærlighet. For det meste har du latt meg se Hugo i Scott-O-Vision, som er en interessant opplevelse; i det minste nå er jeg mildt overbevist om at vi ikke på en eller annen måte klarte å se helt forskjellige filmer som begge på en eller annen måte hadde samme navn og regissør.<br/><br/>Vi hadde absolutt forskjellige erfaringer, skjønt, og til mitt sinn, fokusert på ulike aspekter av produksjonen: Jeg ser fortsatt ikke "filmen er fantastisk" tema som filmens enkeltstreng, så mye som en blant for mange. "Pointlessly diskursive" dekker nesten det, selv om jeg ville kaste inn "ofte unødvendig søt og dyrebar" på toppen av det. Mens du er fokusert på filmens velsmakende paifylling, føler jeg at paien ble dekket med et pund krystallisert sukker, og jeg tror det gjør en forskjell, uavhengig av filmens kjernebudskap eller en håndfull fantastiske scener. Se også Benjamin Button, som jeg ikke tok opp bare for å gni deg - jeg tror virkelig du har mer av en sentimental strek enn jeg gjør når det gjelder barn i kino, spesielt når de brukes mer som symboler på sårbarhet og uskyld enn som menneskelige tegn. Hei, vet du hvilken film som ikke helt har søte bredøyde mopper som gir håp til en kynisk verden? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Kanskje jeg skal se de Blu-ray-ekstramaterialene. Jeg kan bruke litt eksplosjonsinsulin for å kompensere for Hugos søthet. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Jeg håpet at datteren min ville være fri fra vanskelige og urolige tider": Mee Mees historie som flyktningmor<br/><br/>Håp i krisetider: En morsdagshistorie<br/><br/>Flere bøker av Judith Santiago:<br/><br/>Mee Mee hørte at soldatene kom. Hun grep tak i sønnen og sluttet seg febrilsk til resten av landsbyboerne som løp mot den thai-burmesiske grensen, der FNs høykommissær for flyktninger (UNHCR) lå. Mannen hennes var i en annen landsby som løp i motsatt retning, lærte Mee senere. Etter at soldatenes forfølgelse avsluttet, returnerte Mee hjem til sin lille landsby i Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>I perioden 1997-2000 levde Mee og tusenvis av andre som henne under konstant trussel om vold fra burmesiske soldater. Mange mennesker ville ta midlertidig tilflukt i jungelen, og vende hjem til sin landsby etter at soldater forlot området, bare for å gjøre det igjen dager senere. Omtrent en gang i uken ville Mee og andre være på farten for å unngå fangst, voldtekt eller død av soldater.<br/><br/>Under en hendelse løp Mees mann foran sin kone for å sikre mat til sin familie. Hennes mann ble oppdaget av soldater og skutt. Kulen knuste en del av hans ribbein, og etterlot ham alvorlig såret og i nød da han reiste mot jungelen med sin familie for sikkerhet.<br/><br/>I tre måneder gjemte Mees mann seg og flyttet familien med et irriterende sår ved sin side. Han fikk ingen medisinsk behandling, bortsett fra Mees omsorg.<br/><br/>"Jeg var redd for å komme tilbake til Burma," sa Mee gjennom en tolk. "Jeg var redd for å dø. Jeg gråt og gråt hver dag," fortsatte hun.<br/><br/>Mees mann til slutt trakk nok styrke til å gå fem dager mot en liten landsby i Thailand hvor de lærte plasseringen av et sykehus og en flyktningleir. Da Mee og hennes mann endelig kom til sykehuset, gjennomgikk han øyeblikkelig kirurgi og ble senere gjenopprettet.<br/><br/>Symbol på håp<br/><br/>Livet i jungelen for de som flyktet burmesiske soldater var faktisk skremmende og vanskelig. Makeshift bambus telt med bare tak og gulvbelegg ble egnet midlertidige boliger. Mange kvinner inkludert Mee fødte barn i jungelen. Mees da seks år gamle sønn assisterte i leveringen av sin søster som heter Eh Ku Hser. Hennes navn betyr kjærlighet - kald - søt. "Cold" i burmesisk kultur betyr for ikke å passere gjennom livets ild, da varme representerer urolige tider.<br/><br/>"Jeg håpet at datteren min ville være fri fra vanskelige og urolige tider," sa Mee. "Jeg ville ikke at hun skulle gå gjennom det jeg hadde opplevd," fortsatte hun.<br/><br/>For Mee var fødselen av datteren hennes midt i mørket, pine og frykt, et symbol på håp for et nytt liv som skulle komme. Håp i krisetider, selve premisset for United Methodist Committee on Reliefs (UMCOR) nylig co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, er også essensen av det som lysene lyser på.<br/><br/>En ny begynnelse<br/><br/>Med hjelp fra UNHCR materialiserte håpet om et nytt liv seg faktisk for Mee og hennes familie da de bosatte seg i West Springfield, Massachusetts. Der møtte Mee Moo Kho Paw, en annen kvinne som emigrerte fra Burma, og som jobbet på Prosperity Candle i Firenze. Organisasjonen hjelper flyktninger kvinner som har rømt konfliktområder gjenoppbygge sine liv gjennom kunsten å stearinlys. Moo Kho anbefalte at Mee ble med i organisasjonen, og Mee aksepterte gjerne.<br/><br/>"Jeg var spent på å være ute av huset," sa Mee, "Jeg ble oppdratt til å tro at fordi jeg var en kvinne, var min rolle å forbli hjemme og heve familien min," fortsatte hun. Mens mange burmesiske kvinner ønsker å gjøre mer for seg selv, blir de ofte oppfordret til å forbli husmødre.<br/><br/>I dag har Mee planer om å gå inn i stearinlysindustrien for seg selv og støtte sine fem barn, men hun uttrykte behovet for å lære engelsk først.<br/><br/>"I den thailandske flyktningleiren hadde vi utdanning, men det var ikke så bra," sa Mee. "Da jeg var barn, ønsket jeg å gå på skole, men jeg ble fortalt å bli hjemme fordi jeg var en kvinne. Nå har jeg håp om at døtrene mine skal gå på college og bli leger eller politikvinner, sier Mee.<br/><br/>Mee har funnet en balanse i livet sitt som hun skulle ønske andre hadde funnet – et enkelt, lykkelig liv der arbeid, omsorg for familiemedlemmer og valgfrihet har sin plass.<br/><br/>Støtter flyktningkvinner i USA<br/><br/>Del denne morsdagens historie med dine kjære. Og når du kjøper håndlagde stearinlys av Mee, Moo Kho og Naw, en annen burmesisk flyktningkvinne som jobber på Prosperity Candle, vet du at du bidrar til å støtte deres levebrød når de gjenoppbygger sine liv og de av deres familiemedlemmer i USA. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Tilhengere mener at bekreftende handling er mer av en prosess enn en opptakspolitikk. Høyskoler og universiteter tar det ekstra initiativet til å nå ut til minoritetsgrupper, og oppfordrer dem til å søke. Høyskoler og universiteter tilbyr ekstra økonomisk støtte og gi på campus ressurser for å bidra til å forbedre studentens høyskoleutdanning. Tilhengere noterer seg også det økende antall minoritetssøknader til høyskoler og universiteter delvis på grunn av bekreftende handlingspolitikk.<br/>Statistikk har vist at når bekreftende handling er eliminert, for eksempel da det var på Berkley College og UCLA i 1998, falt minoritetsstudentopptakene henholdsvis 61 prosent og 36 prosent, noe som viser at bekreftende handling spiller en stor rolle i en minoritetsstudent høyskoleopptaksprosess. Støttespillere for bekreftende tiltak mener også at mangfold i høyere utdanning gir en bedre pedagogisk atmosfære for alle studenter, personlig og intellektuelt. Hvis bekreftende tiltak ble eliminert, ville det være færre minoritetsstudenter på høyskoler, noe som førte til at mangfoldet var ganske slank. Bekreftende handlingspolitikk er også nødvendig for å kompensere for århundrer med rasemessig, økonomisk og sosial undertrykkelse. Personer med høyere sosioøkonomisk status har flere muligheter enn de med lavere sosioøkonomisk bakgrunn. Tilhengere mener at visse rasemessige eller etniske grupper er vanskeligstilte fordi de ofte er i lavere inntektshusholdninger og følgelig ikke er utsatt for de samme ressursene som studenter fra høyere sosioøkonomiske klasser. Talsmenn støtter begrepet konkurranse mellom studenter basert på fortjeneste, men hevder at bekreftende handling kompenserer for økonomiske forskjeller. Nyutdannede, som har hatt nytte av bekreftende tiltak, har også sagt at de fikk bedre jobber, tjente mer penger og generelt lever bedre liv på grunn av de heldige mulighetene de fikk gjennom bekreftende tiltak.<br/>Tilhengere av bekreftende handling understreker kontinuerlig den alvorlige betydningen av bekreftende handling, med tanke på bidragene til å forbedre både høyskoleopplevelsen og samfunnet generelt. Motstandere av bekreftende handling mener imidlertid at tiden er kommet for å avslutte bekreftende handling. Motstandere mener at bekreftende handling ble opprettet for å sikre rettferdig opptakspraksis for å bringe endring til en lang periode med rasediskriminering. De mener politikken er utdatert."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinasjoner<br/><br/>Kombinasjoner er forsvar mot et slag, koreograferte svar på ulike typer angrep. De har mange navn på tvers av kampsport, men (i min erfaring) hver kunst har en versjon av dem. Dette gjør dem annerledes enn former fordi det er mange kampsport som ikke har noen former. Hva gjør det partner øvelser så universelle? Hvorfor øve en bestemt respons når (i virkeligheten) timing, type angrep, størrelsen på angriperen, og hundre andre faktorer vil gjøre det slik at du aldri bruker hele koreografert respons? Og til slutt, hvordan kan vi øve for en reell forsvarssituasjon og unngå skade på samme tid?<br/><br/>Universaliteten av kombinasjoner er imponerende, for å si det mildt. Vår stil av Kenpo karate har en liste over 108 kombinasjoner som kan læres. (De fleste studenter lærer bare 20-30 skjønt) I brasiliansk jiu-jitsu bruker du hele klasser som praktiserer armstenger og choker, lærer hver subtilitet til bevegelsen mens partneren din tilbyr liten eller ingen motstand. Hver bokser har tilbrakt timer foran posen og / eller speilet kaste den samme kombinasjonen av slag til kroppen beveger seg av refleks alene. Kombinasjoner er universelle fordi vi ikke har noen bedre måte å introdusere bevegelse på og deretter praktisere de subtile stillingene som kreves for å få dem til å fungere. Å treffe et lite trykkpunkt gjennom klær tar mye praksis, å fange en armstang med kontroll krever en nøye plassert hofte og et sleipt oppsett, og en god kombinasjon er bare nyttig hvis du kan gjennom det fra en balansert og beskyttet posisjon. Kan du tenke deg en bedre måte å få disse ferdighetene på?<br/><br/>Det er en rekke faktorer som bestemmer hvordan du reagerer på et angrep, og om i en sparringskamp eller i en kamp, har jeg ALDRI brukt en full kombinasjon i mitt forsvar. Hvorfor bruker vi da timer på å øve dem? Vi praktiserer disse koreograferte svarene fordi målet ikke er å trekke kombinasjon 8 ut hver gang du ser en krokslag, men å vise deg en måte å blokkere den på og deretter en mulig måte å følge den opp. Jeg har aldri valgt å bruke kombinasjon 3 i en virkelighetssituasjon, men blokken er en av mine go-to trekk. Kombinasjoner legge verktøy til verktøykassen de ikke fikse bilen.<br/><br/>Det siste spørsmålet er et spørsmål om sikkerhet. Hvis vi trener for virkelighetens skyld, må vi replikere virkeligheten. Hvordan forhindrer vi skade mens vi gjør det? Når det kommer til det, handler det om å bygge tillit. Vi begynner sakte og lærer å stole på at vi har kontroll over oss selv. Vi lærer å stole på at våre partnere har kontroll også. I mer tid lærer vi å stole på vår kontroll over vår partner og (litt skumlere) lærer vi å stole på vår partners kontroll over oss. Til slutt (med mye trening) kan du flytte er full fart, kaste partneren din, og blir kastet uten frykt for skade.<br/><br/>Kombinasjoner er universelle av en grunn; de praktiseres slik at de kan dissekeres inn i sine deler, og vi holder oss trygge ved å starte sakte og bygge tillit. Som med alt annet i kampsport, kombinasjoner har mange grunner bak sin praksis og utførelse. |
