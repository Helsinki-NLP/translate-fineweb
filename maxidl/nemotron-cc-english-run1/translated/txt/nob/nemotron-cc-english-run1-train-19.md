| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Rumpeldunk gjennom tidene<br/><br/>Jeg doodling noen quidditch-relaterte objekter som kost og snitches og whatnot og det liksom slått inn i denne merkelige samling av ting, inkludert Harry der nede på bunnen. Jeg er ikke helt fornøyd med hvordan det kom ut, men siden det ikke er så verst for mitt andre Harry Potter fan-art bilde, bestemte jeg meg for å fargelegge det uansett. Hvis du lurer på hvor arret hans er, er det der, men det er veldig veldig lett og lite fordi jeg gjorde det litt på datamaskinen. Skissert i penn, farget i Paint. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Jeg har nettopp begynt å fiske etter saltvannsfluer i sommer, og jeg trenger en ny spole, så det blir definitivt Kraken. (Jeg er i Florida; vi har ikke de små ørretene rundt her.) Privat melding på vei til deg.<br/><br/>Jeg er begeistret og smigret. Jeg prøver også å finne ut en måte å forklare til She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed at jeg må kjøpe en ny stang verdig dette hjulet.....<br/><br/>Ikke gi henne en grunn til å si at du ikke er spontan nok. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Hvis du ble tatt opp og registrert -> ja Hvis du ble tatt opp og deltok på en annen skole -> ja Hvis du tok forlengelseskurs (har de til og med dem der? Jeg vet at UCLA gjør) -> ja Hvis du gikk på utdannet skole der -> ja<br/><br/>Det er min tolkning fordi noen av disse scenariene ville oppfylle enten å være "innlagt på et bachelorprogram" eller "ta kurs" ved UC Berkeley. Jeg kan være helt feil skjønt, du er bedre å bare ringe dem og avklare din spesifikke situasjon.<br/><br/>Min mening: Basert på ordlyden tolket jeg det som å spørre om du ble tatt opp til Berkeley undergrad, om du valgte å delta eller ikke. Hvis det betydde innrømmet og deltok, kunne de lett ha sett det gjennom "Undergrad Institutions" -delen av søknaden. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | ...........Mye av tiden hodebolter er vinkel strammet så du setter dem på si 20Nm for et utgangspunkt deretter vinkel stramme dem derfra.<br/><br/>Jeg hadde foretrukket en større hammer.<br/><br/>Skål.<br/><br/>Du kan aldri få for stor en hammer<br/><br/>Jeg skal tilstå.<br/>Det må være en fin forskjell mellom dreiemomentinnstilling med en Click momentnøkkel og vinkelinnstilling, men selv som ingeniør forstår jeg ikke det.<br/><br/>For meg, hvis du strammer en bolt, kommer du til et punkt når den låses. Og som TTT sier ved et relativt lavt dreiemoment. Etter det øker ytterligere stramming både dreiemomentbelastningen og hodevinkelen ??<br/><br/>For meg er det et skille mellom måleteknikker heller enn sluttresultatet. Hvis noen kan forklare hvorfor en i stedet for den andre jeg ville være stor ??<br/><br/>Jeg er sikker på at andre gamle farts vil huske gamle stil momentnøkler med den separate pekeren som svingte rundt en gradert skala når du legger belastning på dem.<br/>Uteksaminert i Ft Lbs, måling i vinkel.<br/>Er ikke dette bare en variant av temaet?? |
| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Vinterbeskyttelse for fikentrær<br/><br/>Rapporter denne artikkelen<br/><br/>Vinterbeskyttelse for fikentrær<br/><br/>Overblikk<br/><br/>Figentreet har eksistert siden minst 5000 f.Kr., og dyrkes over hele verden for sin deilige frukt. Figen vokser godt i et mildt klima uten værekstremer. Figentreet er nå forplantet i noen områder med harde vintre. Beskyttende tiltak er nødvendig for å redde treet fra vinterskader.<br/><br/>Potted fikentrær<br/><br/>Dekorative fikentrær i potter kan tåle litt frysing og krever ikke lys når de går inn i vinterdvalefasen.

Anlegget skal vannes som jorda tørker.<br/><br/>skjerming<br/><br/>Skjerming for å beskytte treet mot det mest ekstreme vinterværet er nødvendig. Fikentrær krever plassering i jordområder der jorda ikke fryser for å beskytte den mot sykdom og øke sjansene for vinteroverlevelse. Store skjermer plassert rundt treet beskytter den mot vintervind som kan skade og fryse treet.<br/><br/>Innpakning<br/><br/>Treinnpakning beskytter treet mot kaldt vær og forhindrer hard vind fra å ødelegge grenene. Fig treinnpakning bør påføres når bladene fra treet har falt for å forhindre at bladene råtner inne i innpakningsmaterialet. Fikentrær er følsomme for små temperaturendringer. Det kan ikke varme opp inne i beskyttelsesfilmen, ellers kan treet begynne å vokse, noe som gjør det utsatt for alvorlig skade under kaldt snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Dyrkingspraksis bidrar til å beskytte fikentreet under harde vintre. Varianter som er motstandsdyktige mot kaldt vær, er best for steder der været er hardt. Brown Turkey, Brunswick og Blue Celeste er gode kultivarer for kaldt vær. Plantering bør gjøres mot en vegg eller struktur som vil utstråle varme mot treet i vintermånedene.<br/><br/>Snø<br/><br/>Røttene til fikentreet krever tørr jord i vinterdvaleperioden. Vanning bør bare gjøres når jorda er tørr og røttene skal beskyttes mot smeltende snø og regn. Beskyttelse plassert på bakken under treet, nær stammen - for å holde vann fra drenering i jorda - beskytter treet mot skade.<br/><br/>Nøkkelord:<br/>fiken treet beskyttelse, fiken treet vinter, fiken treet omsorg |
| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus CEO kommer ned hardt på Mac-støtte for Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, har ikke kuttet sine ord når han ble spurt i et intervju om Rift VR-headsettet noen gang vil støtte Mac. Hvis du hadde noe håp om at det snart skulle bli, vil du kanskje gjøre deg klar for noen skuffelse.<br/><br/>Det er opp til Apple. Hvis de noen gang slipper en god datamaskin, vil vi gjøre det.<br/><br/>Det han refererer til der i en mindre diplomatisk forstand er den diskrete grafikken som kreves for å kjøre Rift. Den enkle sannheten er at Apple bare ikke går for avansert grafikk som vil oppfylle kravene til headsettet. For kontekst, på en Windows-PC, trenger du minst et NVIDIA GTX 970, et $ 300 grafikkort.<br/><br/>Som Luckey fortsatte med å si:<br/><br/>Det koker bare ned til det faktum at Apple ikke prioriterer avanserte GPUer. Du kan kjøpe en $ 6000 Mac Pro med toppen av linjen AMD FirePro D700, og det fortsatt ikke samsvarer med våre anbefalte spesifikasjoner. Så hvis de prioriterer høyere GPU-er som de pleide en stund tilbake i dag, vil vi gjerne støtte Mac. Men akkurat nå er det bare ikke en enkelt maskin der ute som støtter det.<br/><br/>Mac Pro kan ikke anklages for ikke å pakke mye hestekrefter, fordi det gjør det, men like FirePro-grafikk er rettet mer mot det kreative markedet, akkurat som Mac Pro. Spesielt Mac Pro overgår langt andre maskinvarekrav, men siden Rift er grafikktung, er det selvfølgelig her mangelen ligger. Luckey er kanskje litt over toppen, men like mye er han mannen bak Rift, så det er ingen tvil om mye sannhet til det han sier. Selv om han ikke sier det spesielt bra.<br/><br/>Hva sier du, Mac eiere av verden? Er du selv plaget om Oculus Rift eller er det noe du skulle ønske du kunne ha? Lyd av i kommentarfeltet nedenfor!<br/><br/>Leserkommentarer<br/><br/>Oculus CEO kommer ned hardt på Mac-støtte for Rift<br/><br/>Nei, ikke plaget av det siden jeg egentlig ikke planla å kjøpe en Oculus Rift. For meg er produktkategorien fortsatt for tidlig og for mye i en beta-type fase. Men han stiger et gyldig punkt. Apple bør prøve å få mer foran pakken CPU / GPU klokt. Akkurat nå henger de alltid etter.<br/><br/>Unnskyld meg, men hva er HTC Vive bedre på? Og Oculus Rift absolutt støtter Linux-maskiner som oppfyller sine maskinvarespesifikasjoner! (Problemet er ikke OS, men maskinvare.)<br/><br/>Også, se på HVORFOR HTC Vive støtter OS X: det inkluderer mer av sin egen maskinvare. (Som er grunnen til at det koster så mye.) Oculus-løsningene - både Rift og Samsung Gear VR - krever maskinvaren som den plugger inn for å utføre mer av de tunge løftene.<br/><br/>VR er ikke en gimmick. 3D-TVer gir ikke alltid så mye av en 3d-effekt, og det fungerer ikke med alle. VR fungerer med alle, og Oculus og HTC Vive offisielle utgivelsesprodukter har nesten ingen latens, så det er ikke noe bevegelsessykdom. Det er også rikelig med spillstøtte<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig, hvis spilling er en prioritet, er du vanligvis ikke i markedet for en Mac, skjønt. Ikke mange spillutviklere støtter OSX, så disse typer enheter har sannsynligvis begrenset bruk på en Mac (for spill, uansett, som Rift ble designet for). Det er i hvert fall den eneste grunnen til at jeg kunne se meg selv bruke en. Jeg ville definitivt ikke bruke den til å se på filmer.<br/><br/>Apple implementerte Metal-motoren i El Capitan, det kan være noen planer om å gå inn i spillmarkedet (som Apple lærte fra iOS hvor stort dette markedet er, bare se på de beste inntjeningsappene).<br/>Så nå mangler maskinvaren og og spillutviklere vil nok vise litt interesse, siden Mac-er er det nå en akseptabel mengde Mac-brukere rundt om i verden.<br/><br/>Jeg vil gjerne se Apple gjøre sin vei inn i den sektoren av industrien. Jeg bruker ikke noen Apple-produkter for tiden, men de gjør mange av de riktige trekkene på mange områder, og jeg er veldig fascinert.<br/><br/>Plus, konkurranse drivstoff innovasjon. Jeg vet at store datamaskin del produserer allerede skape at konkurransen, men Apple har RnD viljestyrke og penger til å virkelig slå hoder. De kan ikke vinne tallene spill i form av spesifikasjoner, de faktisk sjelden gjør, men de fleste som bryr seg om å gjøre forskningen vet at ytelsen != summen av enhetens deler. Apple kan gjøre mer med "mindre". På papiret virker produktene deres dårligere, men når nøye balansert maskinvare møter spesielt utviklet programvare, utfører de generelt like bra som konkurrentene hvis de ikke gjør det.<br/><br/>HA! Jeg elsker hvordan, plutselig, å ha en datamaskin med høy ytelse er ikke viktig for Apple-fans! Det er ikke en eneste Mac som er i stand til den høyeste grafikken. Kan ikke kjøpe en, kan ikke bygge en. Mac er ikke i stand til å være den høyeste i ytelse, og du er god med det. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Jeg kjøpte min MacBook Pro Retina i 2012 på grunn av den høye oppløsningen og den ikke-diskrete GPU-en. Men for skrivebordet mitt bygde jeg et system med en 4K-skjerm, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU-er og 16 gb minne alt for mindre enn det jeg ville betale for en iMac. Jeg har til og med en SSD satt opp for å starte opp i OSX. Mitt poeng er at Apple kunne gjøre lignende ting hvis det ønsket, men ikke. Faktisk, se på den nyeste iMac. Den inneholder diskret grafikk og en langsom 5400 RPM-stasjon. Datamaskinen min ser kanskje ikke så pen ut, og den er ikke så tynn, men til slutt er den mer nyttig - er det ikke derfor vi kjøper en datamaskin i utgangspunktet?<br/><br/>Jeg kan ikke se hvorfor en Mac pro ikke kan gjøre bruk av Oculus er ikke det bygget for å gjengi video. Jeg forstår at det ikke vil være i stand til å kjøre på iMac og på grunn av dette Oculus bør være merket for Pro brukere på grunn av kravene og kommer til prisen.<br/><br/>Nå sier folk at datamaskinen gjør ALLE de tunge løftene, så hvorfor er prispunktet over $ 800 for noe som ikke gjør noe?<br/><br/>Jeg er spent på retningen til VR, men ikke hvor den er for øyeblikket.<br/><br/>Din skjerm (som Rift er) gjør aldri noen av de tunge løftene. Det er $ 800 på grunn av hva skjermen gjør; 110° visningsvinkel (fortsatt ikke menneskelig øye, men mye nærmere enn andre skjermer) med super lav latens for å redusere eller eliminere bevegelsessykdom på en 1200x1800 per øyeskjerm for HD-kvalitet.<br/><br/>Og ja, Mac er veldig mye brukt til videogjengivelse, men den gjengivelsen skjer ikke ved 30 + fps. Det kan ta timer å gjengi en enkelt ramme og noen ganger år å gjengi en hel film. De endelige produktene, eller pre-gjengitt materiale, er det som da blir 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Takk @TheRealFixxer<br/>Mye av det du sier gir mening, og noen jeg ikke var klar over.<br/><br/>Jeg antar at jeg ikke ser VR som et spill, men som en nedsenking og se Mac er gode på 3dcad og kompilere video jeg tror de ville være i stand til å kompilere en scene godt. Jeg har selv sett 3d gjengivelser av filmen gå gjennom. Opprette en 3D-verden og plassere kameraer i områder for å finne ut hvordan en scene ville se ut<br/><br/>Men jeg er enig i at Mac gjør mer bruk av CPU-sykluser selv ved å bruke det GPU-er for å hjelpe. Med det sagt er det andre retninger man kan ta det. Som eksterne thunderbolt skjermkort.<br/><br/>Mitt store grep er det faktum Octulas er sett på som et forbrukerprodukt. Hvis kravene er så høye, så er det mer et pro-produkt og må annonseres som det. Jeg forstår at teknologien er der, men føler ikke at den er der for å kalle det et forbrukerprodukt.<br/><br/>Ja, du har rett. Apple har også problemer med programvare. De fleste bruker ikke "metall" Apple programmeringsspråk som fremskynder behandlingen for spill fordi det er en Apple eneste løsning der mange bruker spillmotorer som fungerer på Microsoft Direct X eller åpen kildekode Opengl som de fleste spill bruker til å kjøre på Linux og oSX. Opengl er rundt 20% tregere og noen ganger mye mer enn det i forhold til direkte x så en topp av linjen spillkort som kjører i oSX går så fort er en mid-level spillkort i windows. Så store problemer for ikke å nevne de fleste Macs har innebygde kort som ikke har oppgraderbarhet.<br/><br/>Mac pro er så annerledes at Apple ville ha til å gjøre dette som det ikke ville være verdt et kort selger gjør dette som det er ingen fortjeneste i det for dem med den lille mengden av mulige kjøpere det ville være for dette. Apple liker ikke å tape penger, så jeg ser ikke at dette noen gang skjer. Apple ville tape penger som tilbyr skjermkortoppgraderinger for Mac-proffene.<br/><br/>Vel han har et poeng selv om jeg ikke bryr meg om oculus rift, heller vente på starVR. Det bør være et alternativ for å legge til bedre GPUer i en iMac og MacBook Pro. Det er også trist at det ikke er mer nVidia-kort, jeg likte CUDA-støtten nå må jeg kjøpe en PC og installere Linux for mine CUDA-prosjekter.<br/><br/>Gaming er et voksende marked, og det vil ikke være lenge før selv iPhones har mer GPU-ytelse enn Mac-ene. Jeg er enig i at Apple bør tilby en high end GPU i en Mac<br/><br/>Jeg er veldig plaget av mangelen på høy ytelse diskret grafikk på Mac-maskiner. Selv toppen av lignende iMac bruker en utdatert mobil GPU som selvfølgelig ikke kan oppgraderes. Hvis jeg vil utvikle programvare for VR, har Apple ikke gitt meg noe annet valg enn å kjøpe eller bygge en PC for å kjøre den på. Som en stor Apple-fan (ja jeg innrømmer det) gjør dette meg ganske trist.<br/><br/>BTW, VR er ikke noen forbigående kjepphest. Hvis du har prøvd det, vet du hva jeg mener. VR kommer til å endre spill og innholdsskaping for alltid. Min eneste bekymring for VR er at det er for bra. Det kan være millioner av mennesker som vil bli avhengige av å leve og spille i virtuelle verdener. Se på hvor mange mennesker som ble avhengige av MMOer som spilte på en flatskjerm. Med VR føler du virkelig at du er i spillet.<br/><br/>Ikke bekymret for noe, jeg er ganske sikker på at Apple vil ha sin egen implementering for Mac og iOS når tech vil være klar for forbrukere, akkurat nå er det mer for hardcore-brukere. Som alltid eple liker å tid sin tilstedeværelse til rett tid, med riktig produkt. Ha tro på eple.<br/><br/>Det er morsomt at mange mennesker vet hvilken vr som er bedre basert på os-støtte. Jeg antar at dere gjorde tunge tester og nå er fyren i den store elektroniske butikken som vet best.<br/><br/>HTC sa at det vil gi støtte til osx, men det må fortsatt ses.<br/><br/>Jeg forstår at mange av dere er stemplet på der d * * ks. Men forstå at Apple er mer fokusert på bærbare datamaskiner. Og bærbare datamaskiner kan ikke pakkes med mer kraft enn en PC, på grunn av størrelse, varme, strømforbruk etc.<br/><br/>Han har rett, selv om han satte det i **** vilkår. Jeg elsker min Mac, men Herre det trenger et løft i grafikk. Ikke at det må koste mer, men jeg ville være mer enn villig til å betale litt ekstra for et bedre grafikkort eller i det minste ha muligheten til å installere min egen. Det er virkelig for dårlig denne fyren måtte gjøre sin uttalelse høres ut som om han bare er vanlig uutdannet. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid i det amerikanske landskapet: Borgerrettigheter<br/><br/>Tolvteklassinger undersøker og forklarer juridiske rettigheter som er utformet for å beskytte religionsfrihet. De evaluerer i hvilken grad First Amendment beskytter religiøs praksis. De forsker og beskriver nåværende og tidligere juridiske kamper over religiøs regulering og bygninger. De diskuterer om det bør legges restriksjoner på hvor religiøse bygninger er bygget.<br/><br/>Hva medlemmene sier<br/><br/>Som en online videregående lærer, har LP hjulpet meg enormt med ekstra ressurser! Jeg har vært i stand til å bruke flere tilleggsmaterialer herfra og elevene er i stand til å få mer kunnskap og et annet perspektiv. |
| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Hva folk sier 19<br/><br/>Nei, det er fordi underholdningsprodusenter og produktmarkedsførere vil ha skuespillere / skuespillerinner og modeller som ser ut som flertallet av publikum, slik at de er relatable og derfor mer effektive salgsverktøy. Jeg er sikker på at Asiatiske kvinner ser fantastisk til Asiatiske menn. For meg, som en hvit mann, de har null appell.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Jeg er 100 prosent rett. Jeg går ikke utenfor min rase. Da jeg var soldat, hadde jeg "meg elsker deg lenge" -opplevelsen i Asia. Det har fått meg til å føle meg ubehagelig når det er asiatiske kvinner i nærheten av meg. Noen ganger blir jeg dypt ubehagelig, selv om de enkelte individer ikke har gjort noe for å fortjene det. Under et besøk i Thailand, fant jeg ut at den eneste måten å hindre meg selv i å bli foreslått på gaten var å ta hvit en kvinne med meg som en mindreårig.<br/><br/>Aha tingen er at det ikke er mange hvite mennesker (eller noen i det hele tatt) i Kina, men på "hvite" steder, (eller i det minste Australia) er det ganske mange asiater rundt der, noe som fikk meg til å tenke på dette spørsmålet ...<br/><br/>Kanskje i deler av landet der du holder deg til (husk, fugler av en fjær...), akkurat som republikanere ser det ut til at de fleste er republikanske etc. Mens det bare kan være en liten minoritet som du er omgitt av.<br/><br/>Og så vidt jeg vet, er det mange hvite i Kina, hovedsakelig av virksomheten, etc. Men det er enkelt, de fleste er asiatiske, så de foretrekker asiatiske jenter (hunder som hunder , katter som katter, de fleste foretrekker sin egen type). Og det er ikke noe galt med det. Det samme er i hvite land.<br/><br/>Jeg tror asiater er den mest beautful. Dessverre for meg 2 jeg ble involvert med i mitt liv en brukte meg for min plass / internett for lenge siden, og den siste var en gullgravende dum tispe. Hun ble aldri uteksaminert fra college og var 30. Jeg ville være ekstremt glad hvis jeg møtte en smart søt asiatisk kvinne i nærheten av min alder som ikke var en gullgraver.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic ja fordi når en mann elsker dypt han alltid godt med deg i sengen uansett størrelse på pupper eller hudfarge og en ekte mann alltid respektere en jente i alle forhold som mor, søster, kone, kjæreste etc.<br/><br/>som modell fra barndommen fikk jeg min start med et selskap som heter Sugar & Spice. Jeg ble rekruttert i Japan mens familien min var stasjonert der.<br/><br/>du får en jobb fordi de går for et bestemt utseende, hvem de målretter, og området du bor i.<br/><br/>Jeg måtte forlate industrien i fjor på grunn av helsemessige årsaker. Jeg jobbet med mange typer mennesker, koreansk, japansk, kinesisk, polsk, tysk, amerikansk, spansk, arabisk. Jeg har jobbet med barn, voksne, tenåringer alle disse etnisitetene.<br/><br/>Jeg er halvt hvit halv indianer (Lakota) så de elsket utseendet mitt fra en ung alder. men det er mange skjønnhetsstandarder i bransjen, og ikke alle av dem er som portrettert, noen blir gjort for å se verre ut, og noen blir ikke tatt alvorlig nok ...<br/><br/>Nei, det er fordi de asiatiske mennene er sjalu og sinte og oppfinner tusenvis av unnskyldninger hver sjelden gang som har asiatiske kvinner i media fordi de er sjalu på asiatiske kvinner, og amerikanerne ønsker å beholde statusen til hvite kvinner, dette er grunnen til at parene mellom asiatiske kvinner og hvite menn blir boikottet og alle andre hvite kvinner blir presset andre rase, det er hvite kvinner med rase, men hvite menn med rase av antipresjon og hvite kvinner med andre raser i amerikanske medier. Du må forstå den amerikanske politiske sosialteknikken gjennom alle disse årene med media, demokrater, politikk og propaganda.<br/><br/>Uansett, i land som Kina, Japan, Korea de har Asiatiske menn og Asiatiske kvinner bare, og de eneste unntakene er når de importerer en hvit kvinner til å gjøre noen fantasy scene for dem, men det er ikke så mye, det er forbudt å utsette hat og sjalusi av noen Asiatiske menn.<br/><br/>De Asiatiske gutter vil bli glad hvis du sier noe mot andre menn, men de vil bli sint hvis du sier at den Asiatiske jenta vil dø for den blonde jenta dato den kjekke kaukasiske/hvite fyren, vil de prøve å tvinge Asiatiske kvinner til å gjøre noe mot disse mennene til disse små vokal gruppe av Asiatiske menn føler seg bedre i deres hat, unnskyldninger, rasisme og sjalusi. Dette er grunnen til at Asiatiske kvinner er ikke vist så mye, det er fordi de Asiatiske menn vil bli sint, det er fordi de hvite kvinner kan ikke bli erstattet, og den Amerikanske propaganda er rundt hvite kvinner med hvite menn, hvite kvinner med en annen rase, hvite kvinner mot hvite menn for den andre rase av menn, hvite kvinner i alt.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1 &#124;0<br/><br/>0 &#124;0<br/><br/>Mening Eier<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Alle unnskyldninger fra media og propaganda og alle løgner for rasisme, sjalusi og hat er ikke brukt mot hvite kvinner av de samme mennene som oppfinner unnskyldningene, hvite kvinner hele tiden i media, forstår, den amerikanske sosialteknikken er laget av demokrater, demokrater hater hvite kvinner, og de mest populære parene er ikke hvite menn og asiatiske kvinner, men det er forferdelig for noen få grupper av hvite menn å være dårlige og ikke-rasister. Det er et amerikansk politisk problem.<br/><br/>Jeg tror det er en undertrykkelse mot egoet til menn av en annen rase, så de hvite gutta må se dårlig ut, være en slags vitser, være myke, mens scenene med hvite kvinner og annen rase er det motsatte av scenene med hvite menn og ikke-hvite kvinner. |
