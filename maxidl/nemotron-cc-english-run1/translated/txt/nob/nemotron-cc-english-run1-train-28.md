| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Det er et velkjent sitat av Platon som en gang sa: "Jeg vil lære barn musikk, fysikk og filosofi, men viktigst musikk for mønstrene i musikk og all kunst er nøklene til læring.<br/><br/>Uansett hvilken religion eller kultur musikk vil alltid spille og viktig del. Det definerer ofte hva som er i hovedsak unik om en bestemt gruppe mennesker og bidrar til å skape en følelse av fellesskap. Dr Shinichi Suzuki beskriver sin undervisning på denne måten: "Undervisning av musikk er ikke mitt hovedformål. Jeg vil gjøre gode borgere. Hvis et barn hører god musikk fra dagen for fødselen og lærer å spille den selv, utvikler han følsomhet, disiplin og utholdenhet. Han får et vakkert hjerte. Sammen med å forbedre selvtillit og selvuttrykk deres er også fordeler som inkluderer økende minne og antas at læring musikk kan øke akademisk prestasjon. Selv om den eksakte mekanikken i dette ofte ikke er forstått, er troen at læring av musikk stimulerer deler av hjernen som da har en overføringspåvirkning på alle fagområder.<br/><br/>Forskning viser at hjernen til en musiker, selv en ung, fungerer annerledes enn en ikke-musiker. Innen nevrovitenskap har forskning vist at en større andel av nevrale veier brukes til å lære musikk ettersom hjernen må jobbe hardere.<br/><br/>Det er en sammenheng mellom dette og forbedrede romlige og tidsmessige ferdigheter som bidrar til å løse flertrinnsproblemer som innen matematikk, ingeniørfag og kunst.<br/><br/>Det gir også struktur og fokus som kan være til nytte for andre områder av læring. I tillegg til å bringe, struktur, organisering og disiplin som bærer over til andre områder av barnets liv, må vi ikke glemme det viktigste faktum om å lære musikk. Det gir glede og en følelse av moro. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Ut av boksen Fay Tsitou undersøker bevegelige gjenstander i britiske museer<br/><br/>Objekter er hovedaktørene i to forskjellige felt: museer og dukketeater. I begge tilfeller gjør objektene oss i stand til å samhandle med våre omgivelser, vår fortid og vårt indre selv.<br/><br/>Museets besøkende oppfatter et stort flertall av museumsobjektene på avstand, mens disse forblir hovedsakelig statiske og dempet i eller utenfor gallerienes utstillingsvinduer. På den annen side blir dukketeaterpublikum med i verden av bevegelige objekter / dukker som ofte bokstavelig talt får en stemme (lyd eller tale). Likevel er det et felles grunnlag for statiske og bevegelige objekter som er verdt å utforske i disse sammenhengene?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Forskning<br/><br/>Musedukkekunsten tar i bruk dukketeaterspråket i museumsutstillinger. Den tar sikte på å undersøke samspillet mellom museumsbesøkende, gjenstanders historier, utstillingers historier og utstillingers fortellinger. Den undersøker hvordan objekt-sentrert aktiviteter diskret skjule sin besøkende-sentrert identitet mens de gjør besøkende til å frigjøre sitt sinn og hjerte fra mulige hemninger eller fordommer. Musedukkekunst er en type museumslæringsaktivitet, som ligner på og ofte kombinert med museumsteater. Men som G.B. Shaw kanskje sier, "skuespilleren i sin primitive form" (dvs. marionetten) frigjør publikums fantasi som "... spiller en langt større del enn skuespillernes anstrengelser".<br/><br/>Museet dukketeater eksempler i Storbritannia<br/><br/>Det er en rekke variabler som karakteriserer en museumsdukkeaktivitet, for eksempel type museum, type dukketeater, målgruppe, aktivitetsområdet i museet, graden av samhandling mellom de fire enhetene (deltakere, utstillinger / samlinger, dukker, utøvere), bruk av verbalt og / eller objektspråk. For eksempel kan en type aktivitet være et komplett show rundt et museums utførende objekt, som for eksempel i Keswick-museet i Cumbria hvor Ali McCaw presenterte en wayang kulit-stilopptreden, The Musical Stonemason. Showet kombinerte skygge- og borddukkekunst med et gamelan-orkester som innlemmet et museumsobjekt, Skiddaws musikalske stein. Dessuten kan show være relatert til en utstillings fortelling. For eksempel ble professor Geoff Felix populære Punch og Judy street dukketeater show presentert i hagen til Geoffrey Museum og på Museum of London som en del av Victoria Street utstilling (Det er ingen overraskelse å lære at Felix vakkert utformet messe ble en gang forvekslet med en utstilling som det sto i et åpent område på samme museum!)<br/><br/>Andre eksempler er:<br/><br/>Et verksted om marionettkonstruksjon og manipulasjon - som det dyktig strukturerte verkstedet som følger Anna Inglebys skyggedukketeater viser<br/><br/>En dukke workshop basert på museets håndtering samling - som dette skjer på Horniman Museum (London) for å bli kjent med grunnskoleelever med de ulike typer dukker<br/><br/>En dukke utstilling - som automata eller dinosaur animatronics i Natural History Museum i London<br/><br/>Kreative læringsprosesser med bruk av hverdagslige objekter - da disse er tilrettelagt av Hedsor Creative Learning, for å forbedre museumstolkning på steder som Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust og Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>En museumstur med dukken som historieforteller/facilitator - som Vivien Mousdells paleontolog Dr. Ambrose i sitt dukketeater Fossils Alive<br/><br/>Et oppsøkingsprogram - som Jill Websters interaktive dukketeater Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, bestilt av Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulering av dukker som tilhører originale samlinger anses par excellence et museum dukke tilfelle - som John McCormick utført med de viktorianske marionetter på Museum Theatre i London.<br/><br/>De følgende tilfellene belyser ytterligere det mangefasetterte potensialet til å utføre gjenstander i museer.<br/><br/>Autentiske metaforer<br/><br/>I tjuefem år har voksne museumsbesøkende hatt glede av Robert Poulters New Model Theatre i forbindelse med spesielle utstillinger og samlinger, i en rekke europeiske og amerikanske museer. Under Poulters sofistikerte leketøysshow reiser papirfigurer jevnt i tid og rom, mens de samhandler med hverandre og deres scenemiljø. Bakgrunner endrer seg kontinuerlig. Publikum oppfatter verden representert på scenen verken som noe statisk, eller fragmentert, men flytende konstruert øyeblikk for øyeblikk. Selv om dukketeater favoriserer mytologiske og fiktive historier, bruker Poulter sitt talent i maleri og forskning ferdigheter til å tolke selektivt historiske bevis via flate figurer og innstillinger som beveger seg vertikalt og horisontalt. Den forseggjorte, live montasje utvikler seg like raskt og så enkelt, som å snu en side. For eksempel, under kunsthistorieshowet Mr. Turner blir dampet opp, beveger handlingen seg umiddelbart fra Margate til London, eller fra utsikten ut av Turners vindu på lerretet av hans berømte malerier. Frihetene tatt med den muntlige og visuelle fortellingen er notert i detalj på showets program, slik at Poulters vakkert utformede papirfigurer kan stå modig som ultimate "autentiske" metaforer på et miniatyrstadium av historien.<br/><br/>Multisensorisk opplevelse<br/><br/>Ekte kaffebønner, skall og nelliker dekker små trebåter som seiler i et Museum of Docklands 'ytelse opprinnelig utviklet for besøkende med de mest komplekse utdanningsbehov. Båtenes last kan luktes og føles når de (metaforisk) reiser over havet til Londons viktorianske havner i et historiefortellingsstykke med tittelen Over the Sea to London, utarbeidet av Emily Capstick og Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape har skapt deltakende forestillinger i samfunnet, utdanning og museumsinnstillinger i tolv år. Capstick og Hale benytter seg av anvendt teaterteknikk, levende musikk og dukketeaterets rike potensial og fleksibilitet, og erstatter verbal beskrivelse av fortiden med live-action i nåtiden. De skaper en multi-sensorisk engasjerende opplevelse for et publikum i rollen med bruk av dukker og manipulerte objekter, uten å stole på verbal kommunikasjon.<br/><br/>Populær kunst<br/><br/>I fjor utførte Dr. Matthew Isaac Cohen, som en dhalang skyggedukketeer, sin Ramayana i fire deler med Southbank Gamelan Players på British Library, hvor en utstilling under samme tittel utforsket hvordan den indiske episke historien er gjenfortalt gjennom århundrene. På samme måte som en presentasjon til et indonesisk publikum (som nyter stor frihet i å se den populære historien - tilskuere kan bevege seg rundt, ta en lur, forlate showet og komme tilbake!), kunne bibliotekets publikum se den nesten tre timer lange forestillingen som sitter på puter eller sirkulerer rundt den. Under showet kunne tilskuerne også enten bevege seg mot utstillingsområdet for å nyte en museumsopplevelse mens de fortsatt hørte den fantastiske chanting og musikk, eller de kunne gå bak skjermen og utøverne for å ta en drink mens de fortsatt nyter det herlige dukketeateret fra baksiden, sett gjennom en døråpning. Mens den står i midten, skapte den indonesiske typen skyggedukke en intim mellomrom som broer mellom to verdener: kunst og liv.<br/><br/>To bemerkelsesverdige tilfeller utenfor Storbritannia<br/><br/>I 2002 ble en Brooklyn-basert konstruktør / dukkemaker, Chris Green, bestilt for å lage en del av Noahs Ark-utstillingen i Skirball Cultural Center i LA. Hans sofistikerte kinetiske eller fullt manipulerte installasjoner - interaktive utstillinger og dukker manipulert av museets ansatte - ble laget av resirkulerte materialer og tiltrekker seg i dag mennesker i alle aldre og bakgrunner. Noahs Ark-utstillingen mottok priser for fortreffelighet fra American Association of Museums og Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>I 2001 presenterte den berømte franske regissøren Philippe Philippe Genty Le Concert Incredible i Grande Salle de l'Evolution i det naturhistoriske museet i Paris. Høyteknologiske projeksjoner av oppfinnsomme grafiske design ble brukt og samhandlet med galleriets sentrale utstilling: en marsj som besto av store mumifiserte dyr. Dette dukketeater- og fysisk teater-showet var en komposisjon av hypnotiserende bilder, dramatisk action og korsang; en unik opplevelse for et voksent publikum.<br/><br/>Så, som vi kan se museumsdukketeater omfavner et langt bredere spekter av praksis enn man først skulle tro! Å oppfatte museer som bare en annen type arena, og museumsdukketeater som bare et medium som er egnet til å tiltrekke seg førskolebarn med sine familier i juleperioden, er begrensende. Ved å anerkjenne de utøvende objektenes potensial og kommunikative kraft, støtter noen museer bruken av dem for sine aktiviteter og læringsprogrammer året rundt.<br/><br/>Faktisk er disse museene som fremmer et nært forhold mellom de to livløse "sjelebrødrene": museumsutstillinger og utøvende gjenstander. I hendene på ekspertene gir slike samspill en ekstra betydning til et gammelt mysterium: "... Livløse objekter / har du da en sjel / Som klamrer seg til vår sjel / og tvinger den til å elske?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw sitat er hentet fra hans introduksjon til Max Von Boehns Puppets og Automata (Dover Publications.

Almost 20 years later, the challenge of ensuring women's rights remains.<br/><br/>On May 30, the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda released its report, which contains a standalone goal on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. In addition, the illustrative health goal contains a target on ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.<br/><br/>Gender equality and ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential ingredients for sustainable development. We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

Nesten 20 år senere gjenstår utfordringen med å sikre kvinners rettigheter.<br/><br/>Den 30. mai publiserte FNs generalsekretærs høynivåpanel for utviklingsagendaen etter 2015 sin rapport, som inneholder et frittstående mål om likestilling og myndiggjøring av kvinner og jenter. I tillegg inneholder det illustrerende helsemålet et mål om å sikre universell seksuell og reproduktiv helse og rettigheter.<br/><br/>Likestilling mellom kjønnene og sikring av universell seksuell og reproduktiv helse og rettigheter er viktige ingredienser for bærekraftig utvikling. Vi må opprettholde fremdriften som er oppnådd på disse spørsmålene i panelet på høyt nivå frem til de endelige overveielsene på FNs generalforsamling i 2014 om globale mål for fattigdomsbekjempelse og bærekraftig utvikling. Nå mer enn noen gang må vi anerkjenne det sentrale i likestilling, og nå mer enn noen gang må vi gjøre slutt på ulikhet mellom kjønnene som det store målet for det 21. århundre.<br/><br/>Å fremme likestilling i post-2015 agendaen inkluderer å fullføre arbeidet som Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) startet. Dessverre er de tusenårsmålene som er mest off-track, de som er direkte knyttet til å oppnå likestilling, for eksempel å redusere mødredødelighet og sikre universell reproduktiv helse og rettigheter. Det er nå overveldende bevis på at kjønnsforskjeller sterkt begrenser kvinners uavhengighet og frihet, kontroll over sine egne kropper, seksualitet og fødsel, og begrenser deres livsvalg og muligheter når det gjelder utdanning og arbeid. Det er også rikelig med bevis for at det betydelig bremser økonomisk vekst i både rike og fattige land.<br/><br/>Over hele verden, i alle samfunn, møter kvinner og jenter konsekvent en rekke barrierer for likestilling - som lønnsgap, kjønnsbasert vold, barneekteskap og kvinnelig kjønnslemlestelse. Fattige og ellers sosialt vanskeligstilte blir ytterligere marginalisert gjennom lammende kombinasjoner av kjønnsdiskriminering og fattigdomsdiskriminering. Å takle kjønnsforskjeller og kritiske barrierer som hindrer kvinner og jenter i å utøve sine rettigheter og styrke seg selv, må derfor være kjernen i vår innsats for å skape bærekraftige, velstående og motstandsdyktige samfunn.<br/><br/>Å oppnå likestilling - inkludert kvinners rettigheter, kvinners helse og kvinners empowerment - er ikke bare et middel til å utrydde fattigdom og oppnå bærekraftig utvikling, det er et viktig mål i seg selv.<br/><br/>Landemerkedokumenter som Konvensjonen om avskaffelse av alle former for diskriminering mot kvinner (CEDAW), handlingsprogrammet til den internasjonale konferansen om befolkning og utvikling, og Beijing-erklæringen og handlingsplattformen har lenge etablert at kvinners rettigheter er menneskerettigheter. CEDAW, etablert i 1979 og ratifisert av nesten alle land i verden, plasserer ansvaret for å sikre like rettigheter for menn og kvinner med staten. Kvinner må få samme tilgang til alle deler av livet som menn for å oppnå likestilling.<br/><br/>Vi har ikke oppnådd dette ennå. Derfor anbefaler vi at FNs generalforsamling vurderer å effektivt takle denne utfordringen, og den uferdige virksomheten til tusenårsmålene, ved å sikre at likestilling og seksuell og reproduktiv helse er i sentrum av utviklingsagendaen etter 2015, med relevante mål, mål og indikatorer godkjent.<br/><br/>Dette forslaget har sterk støtte blant et bredt spekter av interessenter og utviklingsaktører, inkludert mange regjeringer, multilaterale byråer og sivilsamfunnsorganisasjoner. De respektive nasjonale, regionale og globale tematiske konsultasjonene om helse, ulikhet og utdanning i agendaen etter 2015, samt Rio + 20-utfallets rammeverk for handling og oppfølging, har alle understreket sentraliteten til likestilling og kvinners empowerment.<br/><br/>Tusenårsmålene skapte en enestående mobilisering av politisk vilje og ressurser de siste årene, ikke minst rundt tusenårsmålene 4 og 5 knyttet til å redusere mødre- og spedbarnsdød. Begge disse målene er uløselig knyttet til likestilling og kvinners og jenters rettigheter, helse og empowerment. Det er viktig for vår felles innsats om disse å bli videreført og ytterligere styrket i post-2015-agendaen. Inkludering av mål om likestilling og seksuell og reproduktiv helse og rettigheter i agendaen etter 2015 vil igjen markere den sentrale rollen som kvinners rettigheter som menneskerettigheter. Panelrapporten har gitt et sterkt momentum for disse problemene - nå er det opp til oss alle globale aktører å opprettholde det, og sørge for at det overlever helt til 2015.<br/><br/>Vi er på et avgjørende punkt i vår felles historie når våre politiske intensjoner og handlinger vil forme fremtiden for menneskelig utvikling og vår planet i møte med både enestående prestasjoner og vedvarende utfordringer. La oss sørge for at post-2015-agendaen er virkelig universell og inkluderende, og at det endelige målet er en verden der alle - menn, kvinner, unge og barn - behandles som likeverdige linser er egnet for generelt makroarbeid, men hvis du vil ha større emne-til-linseavstand, vil en 100mm-linse gi deg dette til en pris.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Hvordan mobilspill kan bidra til å forbedre sanitære forhold<br/><br/>Mer enn 2,5 milliarder mennesker, mange av dem i Afrika og Sør-Asia, står overfor alvorlige sanitære utfordringer. I mange av disse landene er det mer sannsynlig at folk eier en mobiltelefon enn et toalett. Derfor er det en åpenbar mulighet for å bruke mobil teknologi for å fremme bruk av sanitære forhold og god hygiene for å gjøre en betydelig innvirkning. Mobiltelefoner i Kenya overfører penger; bangladeshere lytter til engelskspråklige klasser på sine telefoner; og i Ghana bruker kvinnelige entreprenører mobiler til å markedsføre sine varer.<br/><br/>Den voksende Games for Change-industrien bruker prinsipper for tradisjonelle sosiale spill for å løse spesifikke utfordringer. For eksempel, i Storbritannia, bestilte Channel 4 spillutvikler Playniac å bygge et online spill for å forbedre økonomisk leseferdighet blant 50% av unge briter som er tungt i gjeld. I Afrika sør for Sahara og Sør-Asia har unge utviklere bygget iPhone-, Android- og Javascript-spill basert på lokale historier. Pledge 51, en nigeriansk utviklergruppe, ga nylig ut Danfo, et spill hvor brukeren spiller som en bussjåfør som takler tett nigeriansk trafikk.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs har begynt å utforske hvordan spill kan forbedre hygienepraksis. De typiske spillspillerne i Afrika sør for Sahara og Sør-Asia er unge urbane menn som eier smarttelefoner, men mange av samfunnene som står overfor de største sanitære utfordringene, har mindre avansert teknologi. Imidlertid gir Javascript-spill bygget for Nokia S40-telefoner (blant de mest populære håndsettene i utviklingsland) en mulighet til å sende en overbevisende melding om god oppførselspraksis innen hygiene og hygiene. En full rapport om hvordan spill kan fremme god hygiene og atferdspraksis er HER.<br/><br/>Her er noen spill ideer som kan vise seg å være effektive:<br/><br/>Soap Wars gjør håndvask til en underholdende utfordring der spillerne bruker såpedispenseren som et våpen mot farlige bakterier. Sanitation Heroes engasjerer spillere i prosessen med sanitær vedlikehold fra fangst, transport og disponering av avføring til gjenbruk av det som gjødsel. Den har forskjellige scenarier i et minnespill som ber spilleren om å matche løsningen til hvert annet stadium av fangst og behandling av avfall.<br/><br/>Toalett Hunt introduserer hindringer i løpet av å finne et trygt sted å gå på toalettet. Som spilleren søker etter sanitære latriner på et grunnleggende kart, må de bruke ledetråder for å avgjøre om latrinen er trygg.<br/><br/>Det er noen spørsmål som ikke er løst i dagens forskning:<br/><br/>Hvordan appellerer spillet til analfabeter, som trenger rike visuelle beskrivelser og fortellinger for å veilede gameplay? Behovet for rike bilder samsvarer ikke nødvendigvis med de små, lavoppløselige skjermene til Nokia S40-telefoner.<br/><br/>Hvordan appellerer spillet til kvinner, som er kritiske deltakere i sanitet, men ikke representerer den største prosentandelen av mobile spillspillere? En innledende idé er å ramme sanitære historier som mobile "tegneserier", slik at brukerne kan bla gjennom en interessant fortelling med subtile sanitære og hygieniske meldinger.<br/><br/>Hvordan kan leksjonene fra spillet oversettes til landlige områder, hvor det er færre som kan få tilgang til det og flere som står overfor utfordringene det søker å redusere? Urbane brukere kan ta telefonen med seg til sin hjemby og dele den med sine venner og familie, som vil begynne å spille spillet og fortsette å spille ut spillets historie i det virkelige liv.<br/><br/>Til slutt, hvordan kan spillet måle sin innvirkning på sanitetsadferd? Brukeradopsjon og engasjement i denne sammenhengen er en falsk beregning for å evaluere virkningen siden brukere kan spille spillet, men har deres oppførsel uendret. Enhver løsning for å måle påvirkning bør kombinere et mobilspill med andre digitale og ikke-digitale applikasjoner som hjelper brukerne med å spore deres sanitærbruk sammen med deres spillsuksess. Lokale utviklere kan samarbeide med spill for endringseksperter, samfunnsorganisasjoner og telekommunikasjonsselskaper for å teste disse tilnærmingene.<br/><br/>Denne rapporten utforsker potensialet ved å bruke mobilspill for å engasjere innbyggerne i å løse vedvarende samfunnsutfordringer, men vi vil gjerne høre fra deg. Er dette en effektiv måte å engasjere målgrupper på? Er det andre ideer for hvordan spill kan påvirke atferdsendring? Vil du spille disse spillene |
| Sculpins, form a large family (300 species) of small northern fishes living on the bottom in both marine and fresh waters. Though primarily found in shallow waters, some species occur in depths to 1280 m. Approximately 16 species of sculpins exist from the Canadian Atlantic area. The se raven, longhorn, and shorthorn sculpin are the most popular species found in Newfoundland waters. Also known as gurnets, they are sometimes incorrectly called sea robins, grondin and gurnards, which are close relatives.<br/><br/>Sea Scallops: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>They are also called giant or smooth scallops, are the most important commercial species of molluscan shellfish in Canada. They have two round shells, (with the commercial shell size ranging from 15 to 20 cm in diameter) nad are cream in color.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are found in the northwest Atlantic from the northern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the coastal waters of North Carolina in the United States. In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Sculpins, danner en stor familie (300 arter) av små nordlige fisk som lever på bunnen i både marine og ferskvann. Selv om det hovedsakelig finnes i grunt vann, noen arter forekommer i dybder til 1280 m. Det finnes ca. 16 arter av sculpins fra det kanadiske atlanterhavsområdet. Se ravn, longhorn og shorthorn sculpin er de mest populære artene som finnes i Newfoundland farvann. Også kjent som gurnets, blir de noen ganger feilaktig kalt sjørobins, grondin og gurnards, som er nære slektninger.<br/><br/>Kamskjell: (Placopecten magellanicus)<br/><br/>Sea Scallops<br/><br/>De kalles også gigantiske eller glatte kamskjell, er de viktigste kommersielle artene av bløtdyr i Canada. De har to runde skall, (med den kommersielle skallstørrelsen varierer fra 15 til 20 cm i diameter) nad er krem i farge.<br/><br/>Sjø kamskjell er funnet i det nordvestlige Atlanterhavet fra den nordlige delen av Gulf of St. Lawrence til kystnære farvann i Nord-Carolina i USA. I den nordlige delen av dette området forekommer de i grunt vann (mindre enn 18 m), mens i den sørlige delen finnes de i vann dypere enn 55 m.<br/><br/>Offshorefisket foregår på Georges Bank utenfor den sørvestlige spissen av Nova Scotia. Avhengig av området kan kamskjellfisket gjennomføres året rundt.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>For stor til å passe inn i ett bilde<br/><br/>14 meter; 13 tonn.<br/><br/>Seihvalen er ofte forvekslet med de større blåhvalene og finnehvalene. Dens slag ligner på en finnehval, men lavere og seiens dorsale finne er mer hekta.<br/><br/>Seinen viser lite av seg selv når den er på overflaten, selv om den kan stikke hodet opp av vannet, buer den bare ryggen litt og viser ikke sine fliker før den stille dykker. Sei hval er alle en skifer grå farge på toppen og kan være lysere grå under.<br/><br/>Se etter flere slag etter hverandre som sei ligger på overflaten hviler mellom sine dykk. Det kan sees i grupper på to til fem utenfor Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Reker (Pandalus borealis)<br/><br/>Den lille fyren<br/><br/>I løpet av 1990-tallet, carapace lengde statistikk av nordlige reker redusert i kommersielle og undersøkelse fangster utenfor Newfoundland og Labrador. Reduserte vekstrater forårsaket av nedgang i mattilgjengelighet per innbygger på grunn av store befolkningsøkninger, forverret av økte metabolske krav fra høyere vanntemperaturer på midten av 1990-tallet, ser ut til å være hovedårsaken til størrelsesreduksjonen. Fisket kunne ha hatt en akselererende effekt på miljødrevet nedgang i rekevekst og størrelse ved å "beskjære" den største reken fra befolkningen. De største reduksjonene i rekestørrelse skjedde i Hudsonstredet og den tilstøtende nordlige sokkelen, området som også har høyest tetthet og største reker.<br/><br/>Sølvhake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Sølvhake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Sølvkulp er medlem av torskefamilien, men er slankere og har to ryggfinner. De er mørkegrå med sølvunderdeler. Når de tas opp av vannet er de sølvgrå, men den lyse fargen forsvinner snart. Fisk i fangstområdet fra 20 til 30 cm i lengde og veier mellom 0,1 og 0,3 kg.<br/><br/>Fra Grand Banks til Sør-Carolina er det hovedsakelig funnet sølvkulp på Georges Bank og på Nova Scotia Banks, spesielt på Browns Bank og Sable Island Banks på 55 til 275 meters dyp. Kål finnes vanligvis i de varmere farvannene i det kanadiske Atlanterhavet (7 til 10° C).<br/><br/>Tidligere underutnyttet i det kanadiske fiskeriet og høstet hovedsakelig av flåter av andre nasjoner, ble sølvkulp nesten utelukkende fisket av kanadiere ved hjelp av otertråler på slutten av 1990-tallet.<br/><br/>Silver Hake selges i Baltimore som Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja sitta) [glatt] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>Et upopulært sjødyr<br/><br/>Analysen av data for St. Pierre Bank, som ligger sør for Newfoundland, viser at gjennomsnittlig antall barndoor skøyter falt fra ca 0,6 millioner på 1950-tallet til færre enn 500 på 1970-tallet. Ingen barneskøyter har blitt fanget på St. Pierre Bank siden 1970-tallet.<br/><br/>Lukt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Liten fisk til Japan<br/><br/>Innfødt til Newfoundland og Labrador. Om våren vil den seksuelt modne lukten forlate enten havet eller store innsjøer og reise opp bekker for å gyte. I Newfoundland kan dette skje når isen fortsatt er på mange av innsjøene. Men vanligvis skjer dette i mars, april eller mai. Den nøyaktige tiden avhengig av breddegrad og temperatur, vanligvis 8.90C er optimal.<br/><br/>Det skal bemerkes at den nøyaktige gytetiden er ganske spesifikk for den enkelte strøm.<br/><br/>Gytingen kan vare opptil tre uker, men toppen varer sjelden mer enn en uke. Gytingen foregår om natten med gytere som vender tilbake til sjøen eller havet om dagen . Lengden på begge kjønn vil avta i størrelse etter hvert som perioden for gyting utvikler seg. To hanner vil justere seg på hver side av en moden kvinne. Hunnen frigjør eggene sine i klynger, med melken til begge hannene frigjøres samtidig. Eggene blir lim kort tid etter ekstrudering, og fester seg til bunnen grus.<br/><br/>Snøkrabbe (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snøkrabbe<br/><br/>Snøkrabber er vanlige i elvemunningen og St. Lawrence-bukta, rundt Cape Breton Island og i buktene i Newfoundland, fra Fortune Bay til White Bay. De er også funnet nær Hamilton Bank utenfor Labrador.<br/><br/>Snø krabber lever oftest på gjørmete eller sand-mudder bunner ved temperaturer fra -0,5 til 4,5°C. I St. Lawrencebukta er de vanligvis funnet på dybder på 70 til 140 m, mens i Cape Breton varierer dybden fra 45 til 245 m, og 170 til 380 m utenfor Newfoundland. Fordelingen av små krabber er ikke godt dokumentert, men de er sporadisk funnet hos voksne, eller på grusbunner på grunt vann. I noen områder er det indikasjoner på at snøkrabber beveger seg fra grusbunn til gjørmebunn, vanligvis i dypere farvann, når de når modenhet.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Hvor er den sexy badevakten?<br/><br/>5 meter; 1,5 tonn<br/><br/>Det er også kjent som Nordsjøen nebbhval, en sjelden hval hvorav lite er kjent. Det antas å være midthavshval som noen ganger vandrer i land fôring på blekksprut og torsk<br/><br/>De fleste hvalfangstene i det vestlige Nord-Atlanteren har skjedd i Newfoundland og Labrador.<br/><br/>Sowerbys er skifergrå på dorsalsiden og lysere grå på ventralområdet. Hos voksne menn er to tenner ofte sett omtrent en tredjedel av veien tilbake på nebbet som brøt ut utenfor munnen. Nebbet er rundt 50 cm langt. En tilskuer sa at hodet ser ut som en termos.<br/><br/>Spermhval: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>Ingen vitser, vær så snill.<br/><br/>13 meter; 28 tonn<br/><br/>Den største av de tannete hvalene blir ofte referert til som "Moby Dick."
