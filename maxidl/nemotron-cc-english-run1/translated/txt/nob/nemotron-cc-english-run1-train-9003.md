| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed.

Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

Hovedformålet med denne typen poesi er å skape dikt gjennom samarbeid mellom ulike forfattere / poeter, og prøver å danne en samlet stemme mens de fortsatt opprettholder sine individuelle stemmer.<br/><br/>Eksempler på samarbeid florerer i japansk poesi. Selv om de nøyaktige redegjørelser og nedtegnelser av mange slike hendelser er enten tapt eller mangler.<br/><br/>Et av de mest kjente eksemplene på kollektiv poesi skriving var diktsamlingen med tittelen Ralentir Travaux av surrealistiske franske poeter André Breton, Paul Éluard og René Char. Disse tre poetene samarbeidet om å skrive diktene i denne samlingen over bare fem dager i 1930.<br/><br/>I løpet av 1940-tallet oppfant Charles Henri Ford, en amerikansk poet, det han kalte «kjedediktet», hvor hver poet skrev en linje og deretter sendte diktet til en annen person (for å fortsette) i en annen del av verden, i posten.<br/><br/>I 2007 ble en samling av amerikanske samarbeidsdikt Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry redigert og utgitt av Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton og David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing har blitt brukt i skoler og høyskoler for å lære elevene samarbeid og å oppdage måter de er koblet på.<br/><br/>Studie av en figur utendørs: Kvinne med en parasoll, vendt mot venstre, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain eller Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Hensikten med denne artikkelen og hvordan du nærmer deg utfordringen<br/><br/>For noen år siden skrev jeg en artikkel som heter "Poem Without an End" som inkluderte et juledikt jeg hadde skrevet som lånte seg til å bli lagt til. Jeg ble overrasket over responsen som på det stadiet hadde jeg bare noen få tilhengere her. Folk skrev en strofe av poesi hver i "kommentarer" på navet for å følge opp fra den forrige kommentatorens strofe. Det fungerte veldig bra og til slutt samlet jeg alle bidragene til et enkelt dikt som en del av navet.<br/><br/>Lignende utfordringer har blitt utstedt siden, inkludert en av Frank Atanacio kalt "Spirits Sat as Mourners" som også var svært vellykket. Forskjellen er at i dette tilfellet skrev bidragsytere sine egne huber for deres poesi og plasserte en lenke på Franks opprinnelige hub.<br/><br/>For denne spesielle utfordringen forventer jeg ikke at alle skal bruke verdifull tid på å skrive separate nav for en poesi (med mindre du virkelig vil). Hovedproblemet er at for å gjøre det effektivt må du kopiere de tidligere skrevne delene av diktet på navet ditt og vil sannsynligvis bli rammet med "duplikerings" -etiketten.<br/><br/>Så, som er tilfelle, og også for å spare å måtte forlate lenker overalt, ber jeg bare om at alle som ønsker å delta bare skrive sin strofe her i "kommentarer". Sjekk den siste kommentaren før din som bidrar til utfordringen og følg med. Hvis jeg ser mer enn en følger fra samme strofe, vil jeg bruke min poetiske lisens til å jobbe dem i som jeg anser som best.<br/><br/>På et tidspunkt når jeg føler at det har vært nok strofer lagt til, vil jeg sannsynligvis kalle en slutt på utfordringen og deretter kompilere dem alle sammen som det ferdige diktet som en del av artikkelen (også gi kreditt til hver bidragsyter).<br/><br/>Blomstret Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Offentlig domene], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Utfordringen!<br/><br/>Nå kommer den interessante delen. Hvis du blir med på denne kjeden poesi utfordringen må du prøve å holde stilen og stemmen til diktet så nært som mulig til de foregående versene, slik at for uinformerte lesere vil det virke som bare en forfatter har skrevet hele diktet.<br/><br/>Høres enkelt, sier du? Vel kanskje det ville være hvis diktet hadde en tradisjonell stil, rim eller meter. Men dette gjør det ikke! Diktet du skal legge til ble startet av en bekjent av min Andriealphus som en "kjede dikt utfordring" andre steder. I skrivende stund var jeg den eneste andre personen som hadde akseptert utfordringen, og fordi jeg elsket emnet, trodde jeg det ville være en stor utfordring for mine medforfattere og bestemte meg for å bruke den her og se om svaret ville være bedre. (Jeg vet om noen poeter her hvis skriving ville passe denne stilen)<br/><br/>Regler :<br/><br/>Følg med fra forrige strofe i kommentarer<br/><br/>Prøv å beholde stemmen og stilen til diktet<br/><br/>Hold din strofe / vers til omtrent samme lengde som de før<br/><br/>Claude Monet var en av de mest berømte malerne i kunsthistorien og en ledende figur i den impresjonistiske bevegelsen.<br/><br/>I 1883 flyttet Monet til Giverny. Her elsket han å male utendørs i hagene som han var med på å skape. Vannliljene som ble funnet i dammen hadde en spesiell appell, og han malte flere serier av dem gjennom resten av sitt liv; den japanske stilbroen over dammen ble også gjenstand for flere arbeider.<br/><br/>I 1912 malte Monet en serie på 12 vannliljemalerier bestilt av Orangerie des Tuileries, et museum i Paris. Han valgte å lage dem i svært stor skala, og å tjene som en "havn for fredelig meditasjon." Dette prosjektet konsumerte mye av Monets senere år. Monet sa en gang: "Disse landskapene med vann og refleksjon har blitt en besettelse for meg. Det er utenfor min styrke som en gammel mann, og likevel vil jeg gjengi det jeg føler."<br/><br/>Hans helse var nå også et hinder, og Monet gikk til slutt med på å bli operert for sykdommen i 1923, nesten blind, med begge øynene alvorlig påvirket av grå stær.<br/><br/>Monets berømte vannliljer ble rødere da hans grå stær utviklet seg. Etter å ha fått korrigerende kirurgi ødela han de fleste av de "røde lilje" maleriene, sint at ingen egentlig nevnte det til ham. Ironisk nok var disse maleriene sannsynligvis det som gjorde hans impresjonistiske stil så berømt på den tiden - kunstnere begynte å ta mer risiko med farge og slikt i løpet av dette punktet.<br/><br/>Mesterverket<br/><br/>- Gutten som sitter bak deg sier at du ser ut som et mesterverk.<br/><br/>Spør ham, har han noen gang sett en Monet på nært hold?<br/><br/>Nær nok til å se noe annet enn rotete slag av ugresset innsjøen?<br/><br/>Nær nok til å dyppe fingrene i ryggene<br/><br/>hvor oljemaling herdet under en kunstners blikk?<br/><br/>Nær nok til å puste på liljene?<br/><br/>Spør ham, hvorfor malte han dem røde?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Han smilte som Carrolls Cheshire-katt.<br/><br/>"Gjennom tåkete og blodskutte øyne forestiller jeg meg.<br/><br/>Vær mine vannliljer!" sier han,<br/><br/>"Føl pusten min og la fingrene mine dykke,<br/><br/>Bli mitt mesterverk i stedet.<br/><br/>En pensel har aldri rørt et lerret så fint som din lyse hud.<br/><br/>La herrene gråte i sjalusi,<br/><br/>Og Van Gogh skar sitt øre i misunnelse over skjønnheten i din nakenhet.<br/><br/>Selvportrett med bandasjert øre<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Offentlig domene], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Svarene<br/><br/>Nå er det din tur.

Takk for at du ble med i :) din strofe forteller en god historie i noen få ord.

Jeg ser virkelig frem til å legge til dette.<br/><br/>Jeg ville først stoppe inn og fortelle deg det, opp for sikker. Delt også.<br/><br/>Og takk så mye for alle utfordringene for å hjelpe resten av oss, holde vår mentale energi flyter og gi det en trening! Du er den beste.<br/><br/>Informasjonen om LuLu og gratis ISBN-nummer er en bønn besvart! Så smil min venn. Du er en gave!<br/><br/>Klem. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 12. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei igjen Marj. Jeg tror jeg kan ha alle versene som kommer. Jeg har gjort mitt beste for å ordne dem som jeg tror er best med bare litt redigering. Jeg vil nok legge inn det ferdige diktet som en egen hub med en link på denne til den. Min bok er tilgjengelig på Lulu og iBooks... det er en link på en av de tidligere kommentarene. Jeg ville virkelig sette pris på det hvis du skulle purhase en kopi. Husk at det er min første eBok så formatering etc er ikke perfekt, men det har tatt meg syv revisjoner jeg tror for å få det der det er. Det blir lettere neste gang. Hvis du trenger hjelp gi meg beskjed.<br/><br/>travmaj fra australia på August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hei John, du har sikkert hatt noen gode svar på utfordringen din - jeg er sikker på at du vil smelte det helt vakkert selv om jeg forestiller meg en vanskelig oppgave. Jeg er interessert i poesibøkene dine også - jeg må virkelig få min handling sammen teknologisk - Jeg skal prøve å sjekke det hele ut... heier -<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Jo, begge bøkene 'On the Wings of Eagles' og "I Laughed a Smile" har for det meste det samme innholdet... bortsett fra den tidligere har et ekstra dikt. Opprinnelig var de i forskjellige formater, en ePub, den andre PDF, men nå er de begge ePub. De er tilgjengelige gjennom Lulu og iBooks, snart Barnes og Noble og Nook (ikke Amazon). Jeg kan prøve å publisere en annen bok gjennom Amazon snart bare for å se hvordan det sammenligner. Takk igjen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>John, takk mye, info om publisering med Lulu vil være ganske nyttig som jeg tenker på publisering, men jeg er for tiden revet mellom Amazon og Lulu. Jeg ønsket å kjøpe en av bøkene dine, men jeg kunne ikke synes å finne dem på Amazon. Men jeg får det nok fra Lulu, og jeg ønsker deg lykke til.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Phyllis, takk for påskrift. Jeg liker det, en perfekt avslutning på diktet jeg tror.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk til Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Jo, jeg tror jeg har sortert ut diktet tilfredsstillende. Bare venter på å se om det er noe mer å legge til. Publisering med Lulu var ikke dårlig, og nå som jeg har gjort det en gang, blir det lettere neste gang. Å få formateringen til å se riktig ut i eBok var det vanskeligste, selv om du og bare skriver det i et orddokument, og Lulu produserer automatisk innholdssiden og konverterer dokumentet til ePub eller PDF, kan du bare bruke visse skrifter og må sørge for at kapittelnavnene eller dikttitlene er i overskrift 1. De gir også et gratis ISBN-nummer hvis du vil. Samlet var det enklere enn forventet imidlertid.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K den 11. august 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, dette er kortfattet og vakkert, jeg elsker det. Shyron gjorde en utmerket jobb også, jeg trodde jeg allerede hadde kommentert på verset hennes, men jeg hadde ikke.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns fra High Desert i Nevada. den 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Fantastisk hub, god idé, Jodah.

Du er snill. Jo, du har alltid vært en strålende poet. Jeg ser også frem til sluttresultatet etter at John gjør sin magi for å trekke det hele sammen.<br/><br/>Jeg vil dele igjen for å se om det er noen flere takers.<br/><br/>Velsignelser<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K. den 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Tro, vakkert gjort, finner jeg det utrolig hvordan noen med så begrenset syn kan lære oss så mye om skjønnhet, lys og skygger. John, ser frem til å lese sluttresultatet.<br/><br/>Forresten, congtats på å publisere diktene dine. Hvordan fant du prosessen med å publisere med Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Nei, det er ikke for sent, jeg samler fortsatt det endelige diktet, så det burde være opp for alle å se om en dag eller to.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper fra det sørlige USA 10. august 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo, John.<br/><br/>Jeg beklager for min sene innsending her til din fantastiske utfordring. Jeg er borte fra jobb et par dager og bestemte meg for å gi dette et forsøk mens mannen min hviler fra kneoperasjon. Hvis det ikke oppfyller dine standarder, kan du gjerne ikke bruke det i ditt endelige dikt eller redigere som du anser nødvendig.<br/><br/>Velsignelser alltid<br/><br/>Her er det:<br/><br/>Bekjennelser til vennen Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Lys som innkapsler både pine, glede<br/><br/>Glødende galskap i å analysere farger<br/><br/>Spontane kreasjoner<br/><br/>Sesong etter sesong av besettelse<br/><br/>Fange forskjellige fargetoner på et øyeblikk<br/><br/>Se alle hoteller i Argenteuil<br/><br/>Brushwork barer mesterverk.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 9. august 2015:<br/><br/>Bare et rop ut for å se om noen andre fortsatt ønsker å bidra til dette kjedediktet. Jeg har begynt å kompilere strofene sammen, men vil la det være åpent i et par dager i tilfelle noen andre har tenkt å bli med. Takk til alle som har bidratt.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk Genna. Det virker Monet er en favoritt arist av mange her. Jeg håper du vil ta del i denne utfordringen også :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk for et flott bidrag Shyron. Dette er et veldig fint vers. Godt gjort.<br/><br/>Genna East fra Massachusetts, USA den 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>-Hei, John.<br/><br/>Jeg begynte å lese denne fantastiske utfordringen (Monet er en av mine favorittartister), så kom tilbake for å lese ferdig noen av de vakre bidragene som gir dette maleriet en fantastisk stemme gjennom persepsjon og sansene. For et spennende knutepunkt. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko fra Texas på August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Følger Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"Den rene hvite av liljens hud<br/><br/>Snakker om ingen skjønnhet innenfra<br/><br/>Bare Monets vei eller mål<br/><br/>For festende øyne<br/><br/>Ikke fest for sjelen »<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 2. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk for at du kom tilbake Kim, jeg er så fornøyd med svarene. Bare ga å vente og se om det er mer.<br/><br/>ocfireflies fra North Carolina på August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Så glad hver gang jeg kommer tilbake for å se en annen lenke i denne poetiske kjeden, og Wow, gjør Jo det noen gang rettferdighet.<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K. på August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hei John, 'sublime' vil gjøre det bra. Jeg er så glad for at du liker mitt bidrag. Dette er en veldig god ide, jeg vet at du vil ha det gøy å sette det hele sammen. Ta vare og mitt beste til deg.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Takk Deb, ja jeg er imponert over standarden på innleveringer. Jeg ser frem til å sette alt sammen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Ann, det er godt å se poetene blant oss ta opp utfordringen med noen gode bidrag så langt. Jeg håper bare Imcan gjør det rettferdighet når det gjelder å sette det sammen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Godt gjort Jo. Ordet "sublime" kommer til tankene. Jeg håpet alle poeter ville stige til forgrunnen, og de har. Elsker det, takk for å bidra.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt fra Stillwater, OK på August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Jeg er spent på å se hva du ender opp med her. Det er en rekke fine poeter som stiger til utfordringen, så gå til det!<br/><br/>Ann Carr fra SW England på August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Kjempebra, Jo!<br/><br/>Du har fått alle i gang, John! Heller du enn meg, sette alt dette sammen, men det kommer til å være en humdinger av et dikt når det endelig kommer til en slutt - hvis det noen gang gjør! Du har virkelig startet noe.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K. på august 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John her går ingenting! Etter Kims. Jeg håper det leser godt.<br/><br/>Og gutten begynte å gå bort<br/><br/>Men i kjølvannet hørte jeg ham si:<br/><br/>"Jeg tok en tur til Orangerie<br/><br/>Hvor spøkelset av Monet fortsatt bor<br/><br/>Jeg satt rett ned og stirret en stund<br/><br/>Til jeg hørte en myk stemme gråte.<br/><br/>Har du noen gang sett en flytende drøm?<br/><br/>Hvor lyset utvikler seg til det det berører<br/><br/>Hvor roen strømmer gjennom skyet slør<br/><br/>Hvor tryllekunstnerens pensel som lynende rush<br/><br/>Har du noen gang sett et praktfullt syn?<br/><br/>Et barn født av forvrengt illusjon<br/><br/>Denne blomstrende dammen som fanger lyset<br/><br/>Det løfter hjertet og lokker sjelen<br/><br/>En abstrakt pulchritude på nært hold<br/><br/>Gå tilbake, se; så rolig glede. "<br/><br/>Jeg håper dette er i tråd med hva de andre har gjort. Føl deg fri til å redigere om nødvendig. Mitt beste...<br/><br/>- Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K. på august 01, 2015:<br/><br/>- Greit.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 1. august 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Jo, vær så snill. Alle er velkommen til å gjøre mer enn en strofe. Jeg kan legge til en annen selv på et tidspunkt.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K. på august 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, jeg har bestemt meg for å ta en tur, men det er omtrent 16 linjer, kan jeg gjøre det i to strofer etter Kims fantastiske innlevering? Du kan alltid redigere det senere.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hei Jo, beklager å høre at du er under været for øyeblikket. Jeg har ikke hastverk med å lukke denne utfordringen, så jeg holder den åpen til du skyter på alle sylindere og kan bidra. Du er en av de hubbers jeg gledet meg til å få et svar fra som jeg trodde det ville passe. Takk for dine hyggelige ord, og bli frisk snart.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues fra Lincolnshire, U.K. den 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Jeg kan ikke tro at jeg nesten savnet din utrolige utfordring. Dette er noe jeg ville ha elsket å delta i siden Claude Monet er en av mine all times favorittartister. Dessverre må jeg gråte av. Jeg er litt under været med et hode fullt av bomullsull, eller så virker det. Hvis utfordringen fortsatt er åpen når jeg blir kvitt denne irriterende influensaen, kan jeg gi det en tur, men jeg må si at standarden er eksepsjonelt høy. Maj tok det til et annet nivå, men alle innleveringene er strålende. Kudos til deg Andriealphus og de andre forfatterne som har deltatt så langt i dette kunstneriske og kreative mesterverket.<br/><br/>Min beste alltid Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 31. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hei igjen Maj, glad dette diktet inspirerte deg, og ja det slår å se på cricket spesielt med de Aussie batsmen som utfører dårlig i denne tredje testen. Det vil være en interessant øvelse for meg å smelte alle strofene sammen, men bør være bra.<br/><br/>travmaj fra australia 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>John, takk, jeg er mest glad du liker mitt tilbud. Jeg fant diktet spennende og plutselig følte inspirert til å skrive min versjon i samme modus. Jeg er ikke sikker på at jeg skrev en fortsettelse fra strofen før (alltidutforskende), men jeg er sikker på at du vil fusjonere det helt når tiden kommer. Elsker alle svarene. Jeg har ikke klart noen kreativ skriving for yonks, kan ikke vente nå til å starte på nytt, trenger bare litt tid. (beats ser på cricket også!!!) Skål John, vil sjekke inn -<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Takk for at du sjekket Dana. Jeg er fornøyd med kvaliteten på svarene så langt. Jeg må bare vente og se hvor mange flere som kommer inn. Den endelige, dikt skal være flott.<br/><br/>Dana Tate fra LOS ANGELES 30. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Bare sjekket inn for å se hvordan det går, jeg kan ikke vente på det ferdige produktet. Jeg deltok på en poesi klasse, og vi gjorde dette også det var veldig gøy.<br/><br/>ocfireflies fra North Carolina på juli 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Takk så mye for å gi plattformen for uten at det er lett å falle ned.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Jeg har ikke sett deg på en stund, håper alt er bra.<br/><br/>John Hansen (forfatter) fra Gondwana Land 29. juli 2015:<br/><br/>Vakkert arbeid Kim. Det vil følge på perfekt fra Maj's som du svarte på GIverny spørsmålet. Jeg er så fornøyd med kvaliteten på svarene så langt.<br/><br/>ocfireflies fra North Carolina på juli 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Jeg hadde sendt dette tidligere før travmaj's awesome bidrag, men kanskje det fortsatt fungerer (jeg gjorde litt tweaking)<br/><br/>i motsetning til tidligere - vet ikke om<br/><br/>Jeg gjør noe fornuftig. Hvis det ikke fungerer, kan du gjerne slette, og jeg vil prøve igjen. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Først av alt må EEQT selv videreutvikles for å gi et teoretisk og beregningsmessig svar på behovene til moderne kvanteteknikk og teknologi. Vi må inkludere klassiske systemer med uendelig mange frihetsgrader – som elektromagnetiske og/eller gravitasjonsfelt. Vi må også inkludere uendelig mange kvantesystemer for å forstå og simulere Bose-gassen og dens faseoverganger. Men det er også skritt som må tas langt utover paradigmet av EEQT.<br/>Som vi har understreket så mange ganger: kvanteteori har ennå ikke blitt forstått i form av en "ikke-lineær klassisk teori." Men det vi mener med en "klassisk teori" er noe mye mer avansert og mer generelt enn klassisk mekanikk eller klassisk feltteori. Med en "klassisk teori" mener vi først og fremst en teori som ikke er basert på sannsynligheter fra begynnelsen; en teori der sannsynligheter vises på et senere stadium, avledet fra teorien; avledet kanskje, på en nødvendig måte. En slik teori må ikke bare spesifisere de matematiske objektene og deres relasjoner, men også gjøre "forutsigelser".<br/>En klassisk teori er spesielt en teori der diskrete hendelser kan skje, hendelser som er "objektive". De kan være hendelser som hovedsakelig påvirker det fysiske sjiktet, men de kan også være "mentale hendelser", endringer i tilstander av "bevissthet"; hva de enn er, selv om de er opptatt av forgreninger av universer, - de SKJER.<br/>En slik teori, som omfatter kvanteteorien slik vi kjenner den i dag, eksisterer ennå ikke, men vi kan forestille oss dens mulige form. Ingenting tjener bedre enn et eksempel, så la oss gi her et eksempel på hvordan en slik teori kan tolkes.<br/>Tenk deg en teori utviklet a'la Einsteins enhetlige feltteori, men med variabel metrisk signatur, muligens med en kompleks kausal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (se også [41]) broer, tidssløyfer, ikke-differensiering, fraktalstruktur, alt dette i tillegg komplisert av variabel dimensjonalitet av rom og "tid" (jf. [42]. Tenk deg en slik teori for å kunne imøtekomme alle de fire grunnleggende kreftene som er kjent for oss, men det innebærer også et ekstra felt, som er forskjellig fra fysiske felt, og som er ikke-lokalt i den forstand at det ikke overlever å ta en makro-gjennomsnitt-grense når kausal rom-tid-struktur av Einsteins generelle relativitetsteori er gjenopprettet. Dette ekstra feltet ville være et sted for "tankeformer", og vår teori ville koble disse tankeformene til mer "fysiske" nivåer av virkeligheten.<br/>"tid" ville bare oppstå i en bestemt begrensende struktur. Ingenting hindrer en teori av en slik type å ha matematiske strukturer som er rike nok til å imøtekomme bevissthet og sinn. På grunn av sin kompleksitet, tetthet av tidssløyfer, boble-lignende kausal struktur, noe som gjør spådommer i en slik teori er bare mulig ved å bruke sannsynlighet -<br/>som det er tilfelle med systemer som utvikler seg i henhold til deterministisk, men kaotisk dynamikk. Kvantebølgefunksjon ville dukke opp i en slik teori som en effektiv måte å forutsi. Denne typen forklaring på kvante indeterminisme ble postulert for lenge siden av I. J. Good. I<br/>Han spekulerte i at kvante indeterminisme kan forstås hvis vi innrømmer at individuelle kvantehendelser som faktisk skjer her og nå har fremtidige avanserte årsaker, også har tidligere retarderte årsaker.<br/>Et glimt av en slik tanke kan ha kommet til Alan Turing da han skrev sin berømte, allerede siterte setning: "Forutsigelse må være lineær, beskrivelse må være ikke-lineær."<br/>En teori som delvis går i denne retningen blir utviklet av L. Nottale<br/>[43] som sier observasjonen, tilskrevet Feynman, at «de typiske banene til kvantemekaniske partikler er kontinuerlige ikke-differensierbare.» Kvanteatferden blir i denne teorien en manifestasjon av romtidens fraktale geometri, på samme måte som gravitasjon i Einsteins teori om generell (bevegelses-)relativitet blir en manifestasjon av romtidens krumning.<br/>Et annet skritt i denne retningen kommer fra arbeidet med russiske forskere - som startet med de mest originale ideene til N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>og A. Sakharov [45], og blir utviklet i Moskva, Ural og Sibir, se f.eks. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Beste ernæring og trening for å miste vekt<br/><br/>Hvordan er frokost egentlig sunt?<br/><br/>Om morgenen som en keiser, midt på dagen som en konge, om kvelden som en tigger – lyder et kjent ordtak. En studie av den medisinske organisasjonen Endocrine Society bekrefter hovedbudskapet bak ordtaket: Det viser at frokost spiller en viktigere rolle enn det som ofte antas. Om morgenen har menneskekroppen faktisk mer enn dobbelt så høy metabolsk aktivitet som på andre tider av dagen: En stor frokost holder deg ikke bare full i lang tid, blodsukkeret og insulinnivået stiger også sakte. Appetitten for søtsaker er regulert, vi spiser snacks sjeldnere i løpet av dagen. Derfor bør frokost ikke hoppes over selv under en diett.<br/><br/>Selvfølgelig, å ha en stor frokost betyr ikke at vi skal ha flere croissanter med mutter nougat krem og søte frokostpannekaker om morgenen. Frokost er sunn best når den er høy i protein og fiber, samt gi vitaminer og mineraler. Hele korn brød eller müsli, havregryn, frukt og nøtter er energileverandører som er bra for deg og holde deg full i lang tid.<br/><br/>Det faktum at en stor frokost er bedre enn en stor middag betyr ikke nødvendigvis at frokost er viktig for å miste vekt. En meta-analyse utført i 2019 viste, at det totale daglige energiinntaket for personer som spiser frokost i gjennomsnitt er høyere, enn for de som ikke spiser frokost. Sistnevnte var i gjennomsnitt litt under en halv kilo lettere. Så, ifølge resultatene av denne store studien, trenger du ikke nødvendigvis å spise frokost hvis du vil gå ned i vekt.<br/><br/>Gå ned i vekt med riktig diett - det er hvor lett det er å sette sunn på tallerkenen din<br/><br/>Å spise sunt betyr ikke på noen måte mindre smak. Friske grønnsaker, fisk eller kjøtt som proteinkilder og andre sunne ingredienser fremkaller smak i potten og et smil på leppene dine - ideelt også når du går på skalaene. En amerikansk studie har vist at folk som lager sin egen mat og bevisst forholder seg til hva de spiser, har en kroppsmasseindeks i det normale området. Restaurantbesøk eller hurtigmat, derimot, lokker deg raskt inn i sukkerfellen: Ofte er det ingen indikasjon på hvor mye sukker er i salatdressinger, hvor mye fett potetene ble stekt i eller om kjøttet ikke ble behandlet.<br/><br/>En sunn lunsj består av tre deler - den største delen er frukt eller grønnsaker og skal dekke halvparten av tallerkenen. En fjerdedel av måltidet skal bestå av protein, det vil si fisk, kjøtt eller tofu. Det resterende kvartalet består av karbohydrater og er ideelt laget av fullkornsprodukter. Viktig: Ikke spis på skrivebordet på kontoret, men stimulere stoffskiftet og ideelt sett ta en kort spasertur før eller etter lunsj.<br/><br/>Når bør du spise for å gå ned i vekt?<br/><br/>Om kvelden bør du fokusere på lette måltider som er ganske lave i karbohydrater. Disse er minst sannsynlig å forårsake insulin til skyrocket, noe som er bra for kroppen vår. Grønnsaker, meieriprodukter og nøtter, for eksempel, er godt egnet for dette.<br/><br/>Du bør også være forsiktig med å spise middag for sent. Det er best å ha spist til 19:00 - da kan kroppen slappe av og forberede seg på natten. Tilstrekkelig søvn er viktig for sunt vekttap. En amerikansk studie fant at folk som sov om åtte timer om natten hadde bedre fettdepoter. Så god natt! Tillat deg mer enn seks timers søvn, slik at du kan starte neste dag passform og forfrisket.<br/><br/>Å miste vekt uten trening - er det virkelig mulig?<br/><br/>Det ville være så enkelt, hvis drømmevekten kunne oppnås bare ved å senke kaloriinntaket. Men du vet sikkert visdommen at kosthold bare er den ene siden av mynten og trening er den andre. Så ingenting hjelper: Sett på sportsklærne dine og gå!<br/><br/>Alle som, i tillegg til sportsprogrammet som jogging, turgåing eller svømming, også lar heisen gå alene og tar trappen, tar en liten omvei eller bruker sykkelen i stedet for bilen, gjør wellis også kalt noe bra. Selv enkle turer er bra for helsen. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Hvorfor vi åpnet kilden til Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Hvorfor Open Source?<br/><br/>For en liten stund siden open-sourced vi Anvil App Server. Fellesskapet reaksjonen har vært stor, selv litt overveldende (ja, hvert svar på at kunngjøringen virkelig landet i innboksen min!). Vi har allerede innlemmet en haug med den tilbakemeldingen i vår versjon 1.2-utgivelse. Men vi blir stadig spurt, " Hvorfor har du åpen kildekode en slik kjernedel av produktet ditt? "<br/><br/>Hvorfor gjør du dette i det hele tatt?<br/><br/>Anvil er et verktøy som gjør det så enkelt som mulig å bygge en web-app. Vi gjør det ved å gjøre det mulig å bygge hele programmet i ett språk, Python.<br/><br/>Enkel hosting er en del av det.<br/><br/>Nettplattformen er ødelagt, og Anvil er vårt forsøk på å fikse det. Og fordi det er så mye kompleksitet i å distribuere en webapp, var en sky-hostet tjeneste den beste måten å gi enkelheten vi vil ha. På den måten kan du bygge appen din i Anvil Editor, og få den til å leve på Internett med ett klikk.<br/><br/>Men vi fortsatte å høre fra folk som sa: "Det er flott, men..."<br/><br/>"... men jeg må kjøre dette på en offshore-plattform uten pålitelig internettilgang"<br/><br/>"... men jeg vil pakke appen min inn i en IoT-enhet jeg selger"<br/><br/>eller ganske enkelt, "... men hvis jeg legger eggene mine i denne kurven, hvordan kan jeg være sikker på at jeg fortsatt kan kjøre appen min om ti år?"<br/><br/>Dette er alle gode poeng! En skytjeneste er ikke den rette løsningen for alle. Hvis vi ønsker å betjene disse brukerne, må det være en eller annen måte for dem å få appene sine ut av Anvil og kjøre dem lokalt, under egen fullstendig kontroll.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape luke, ikke en ejektor sete<br/><br/>Vi tror på rømningsluker, ikke ejektorseter. På konferanser blir vi noen ganger spurt, "kan jeg eksportere dette som en Flask + JS app?". Jada, det ville være mulig - vi kunne generere en serverpakke, kompilere klientsiden Python til Javascript, og spytte ut en klassisk webapp. Men det ville ha alvorlige ulemper, fordi:<br/><br/>Ikke en behagelig tur.<br/><br/>Kodegenerering er et ejektorsete. Generert kode er bedre enn ingenting – i det minste kan du redigere den! Men i det øyeblikket du redigerer den koden, mister du alle fordelene med systemet som genererte den. Hvis du bruker Anvil på grunn av dra-og-slipp-editoren og Python i nettleseren, hvorfor skal våre lokalt vertsbaserte brukere måtte bruke vim og Javascript?<br/><br/>Så vi gjorde det på riktig måte: Vi open-sourced Anvil kjøretidsmotor. Det er den samme koden som tjener appen din i vår vertstjeneste, og den representerer appen din på samme måte. Du kan redigere koden din med en tekstredigerer, kjøre den, og git skyve den tilbake i vår online IDE. Det er ikke et ejektorsete: det er ingen eksplosiv overgang. Det er en rømningsluke: du kan klatre ut og klatre rett tilbake i.<br/><br/>Hva med vår forretningsmodell?<br/><br/>Anvil var aldri ment å være en av de enterprise low-code systemer som belaster deg $20 / mo for hver person som bruker appen din. Anvil er et utviklerverktøy. Appene du utvikler er dine. Å la deg kjøre dem på en Raspberry Pi er kult, men det endrer ikke vår forretningsmodell.<br/><br/>Vi gjør det vi alltid har gjort: Vi lager og selger et utviklingsverktøy som gjør det drastisk enklere å bygge webapplikasjoner. Vi tilbyr hosting for Anvil-apper. Vi tilbyr hele utviklings- og hostingplattformen på stedet for bedriftskunder. Og selvfølgelig tilbyr vi en gratis plan slik at alle kan bruke Anvil til hobby- eller utdanningsformål - eller for å begynne å bygge noe og se hvordan det går.<br/><br/>Vi har open-sourced Anvil App Server for det (relativt små) antall mennesker som trenger det, og for å gi den ultimate forsikringen. Jada, du kan bygge en app med vim og være vert for det selv, uten å registrere en konto hos oss (vi har dokumenter for å vise deg hvordan!). Men Anvil Editor er verdens enkleste måte å bygge en webapp på, og vår vertstjeneste er den enkleste måten å distribuere den på - så det er det vi forventer at de fleste av våre brukere skal fortsette å gjøre. Og du kan bygge med tillit, vel vitende om at åpen kildekode er akkurat der hvis du trenger det.<br/><br/>Prøv det selv<br/><br/>Hvis vår utviklingsfilosofi resonerer med deg, hvorfor ikke prøve Anvil selv? |
