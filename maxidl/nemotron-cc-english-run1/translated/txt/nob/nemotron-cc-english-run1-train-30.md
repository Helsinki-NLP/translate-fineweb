Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Innleggsnavigasjon<br/><br/>«Life Without Papers» vant beste manus<br/><br/>Bloggprosjektet, "Life Without Papers", skapt av Len Grant, har historier om udokumenterte innvandrerfamilier og unge mennesker. Udokumenterte innvandrere har ingenting. De har ikke lov til å jobbe. De har ingen rett til statlige fordeler eller til et sted å bo. De er usynlige og potensielt den mest sårbare gruppen i Storbritannia i dag.<br/><br/>Udokumenterte (eller irregulære) innvandrere inkluderer de som er smuglet inn i sexhandel eller for husarbeid; de inkluderer visumoverlevende; de hvis asylsøknader har blitt avvist og andre som har vært utsatt for feil i innvandringssystemet. Alle disse kan opprinnelig ha kommet til Storbritannia lovlig.<br/><br/>"Ulovlige innvandrere" - de som forestiller seg å ha kommet inn i landet bak lastebiler - utgjør en liten andel av de udokumenterte.<br/><br/>Faktisk antyder noen kilder at halvparten av de anslåtte 120 000 udokumenterte barna i Storbritannia faktisk ble født her til udokumenterte foreldre. Disse barna er ugunstige fra fødselen, utelukkende på grunn av deres innvandringsstatus.<br/><br/>Bloggen forteller historiene til de udokumenterte. Det fremhever deres daglige kamper og sårbarheter, men også deres styrke og motstandskraft. Det er ikke lett å lese.<br/><br/>Du kan få tilgang til bloggen via vår hjemmeside (nederst i høyre kolonne på hjemmesiden).<br/><br/>Bloggen har vunnet online kategorien av Speaking Together media awards. Prisene var et nytt tillegg i år til migrant og flyktning kvinne av året Awards feiring i Royal Festival Hall i London som en del av International Women's Day. Panelet av dommere - inkludert romanforfatter og dramatiker Gillian Slovo, og journalist og forfatter, Hannah Pool - var spesielt på utkikk etter arbeid som utfordret myter og stereotyper.<br/><br/>Bloggen har også vunnet Blog North Awards 2013 i kategorien Best Writing og ble også nominert til en Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>I Galaterbrevet tar Paulus opp slike spørsmål som frihet, lovens rolle i frelsen, vår tilstand i Kristus og det åndsledede livs natur, samt det eldgamle spørsmålet: Hvordan kan syndige mennesker bli gjort rettferdige for en hellig og rettferdig Gud?<br/><br/>Mange forskere mener at galaterne kan være den tidligste av Paulus 'brev. Det ble skrevet i AD 49, kort tid etter den berømte Jerusalem Council (Apg 15). Derfor kan boken være den eldste kristne dokumentet kjent. Som Apostlenes gjerninger og Galaterne gjør det klart, befant den tidlige kirken seg i en hard kamp over frelsens natur, spesielt når det gjelder hedninger. Ifølge en gruppe jødiske troende, kjent som judaister, var troen på Jesus alene ikke god nok for hedninger. Hedninger må også omskjæres og følge Moseloven (Apg 15:1).<br/><br/>Dette kvartalets bibelstudieguide inviterer oss til å reise med apostelen Paulus når han bønnfaller galaterne om å forbli tro mot Jesus. Det gir oss også en sjanse til å reflektere over vår egen forståelse av sannhetene som åpnet veien for Martin Luthers endelige brudd med Roma og gjenopprettelsen av det bibelske evangeliet. |

Før han overtok tronen tjente han som guvernør i Hannover fra 1776 til 1786, den 11. desember 1752 døde hans onkel Adolphus Fredrik III, og som et resultat av dette ble Karls eldre bror Adolphus Fredrik IV. Med sine brødres oppstigning ble Karl tatt med resten av familien fra Mirow til hovedstaden Strelitz, fra en alder av fire, så Karl ut til å være klar for en karriere i Hannover-tjenesten etter å ha blitt gitt en kapteinskommisjon. Hans søster Charlotte giftet seg med kurfyrsten av Hannover, kong Georg III av Storbritannia den 8. september 1761, høsten 1776 ble Karl utnevnt til generalguvernør av Hannover av sin svoger. Som guvernør av Hannover hadde Karl alle maktene til en suveren hersker og hans svoger hadde ikke noe ønske om å oppholde seg i Tyskland. Kort tid etter å ha blitt enke for en tid i desember 1785, søkte Karl om tillatelse til å trekke seg tilbake fra sine militære ansettelser i Hannover. Hans svoger innvilget hans anmodning, forfremmet Karl til rang av feltmarskalk, Karl tilbrakte deretter litt tid på reise før han bosatte seg i Darmstadt, hvor han ble president for den keiserlige kredittkommisjonen.

Hun var det eldste barnet og datteren til Karl II, storhertug av Mecklenburg, Charlotte og hennes søstre, dronning Louise av Preussen, dronning Frederica av Hannover og prinsesse Therese av Thurn und Taxis, ble ansett som de vakreste kvinnene i sin tid. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter dedikerte sin roman Titan til de fire vakre, Charlotte vokste opp i Hannover, hvor hennes far fungerte som guvernør, på vegne av sin svoger, kong George III av Storbritannia, som bodde i London. Da Charlotte var tolv år gammel døde hennes mor og hun ble oppdratt av sin mors søster, Charlotte, som giftet seg med hennes far i 1784 og hennes søstre ble brakt av hennes bestemor, Maria Louise Albertine av Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg i Darmstadt. Den 3. september 1785, i en alder av 15 år, giftet Charlotte seg med hertug Fredrik, hertug av Sachsen-Altenburg. Ekteskapet var ikke lykkelig, Charlotte var mentalt overlegen Fredrik, som begynte å ignorere henne. De hadde også problemer, Sachsen-Hildburghausen hadde blitt økonomisk ruinert av den katastrofale politikken til Fredriks forgjengere. Charlottes far og to brødre bodde ofte hos Charlotte i Hildburghausen, og i 1787 flyttet hun til Hildburghausen for godt. I 1792 flyktet Charlottes bestemor og hennes søstre før den fremrykkende franske hæren fra Darmstadt til Hildburghausen, og hennes bestemor la merke til Charlottes ektemann. Av alle sine plikter oppfyller han sine ekteskapelige plikter med iver. Charlotte, som aldri elsket denne mannen, er alltid gravid, familien tilbrakte flere bekymringsløse uker på Hildburghausen. I 1793 kom Charlottes bestemor tilbake fra eksil og reiste med Charlottes søstre til Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte hadde et veldig intimt og kjærlig forhold til sin søster Friederike og slektninger i Strelitz. I 1803 og 1805 besøkte det prøyssiske kongeparet Hildburghausen, for denne anledningen tillot mottakerne hertugparet å fornye noen av møblene sine. Louise hadde bidratt til å utarbeide krigserklæringen, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg var en venn av hertugparet og gudfar til Charlottes sønn Edward. Mange tilskuere hadde kommet for å se den bayerske kronprinsessen, da han mottok sine gjester, forsøkte Truchseß å lede den lavere rangerte Charlotte først inn i slottet hans, men hun nektet, med henvisning til sin datter. Truchseß svarte: «Deres høyhet vil tilgi meg, men så lenge dette slottet har stått her, tok Therese baronenes andre arm, og de tre gikk sammen gjennom porten. Hertuginnen ga omtrent halvparten av sin inntekt til de fattige, pensjonistene.<br/><br/>- 1617.<br/>Karl av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prins Charles av Hessen-Kassel var et kadettmedlem av huset Hessen-Kassel og en dansk generalfeltmarskalk. Han vokste opp med slektninger ved det danske hoff, og tilbrakte det meste av sitt liv i Danmark, og hans mor var datter av kong Georg II av Storbritannia og Caroline av Ansbach og søster av dronning Louise av Danmark. Hans far, den fremtidige landgreve, forlot familien i 1747, og i 1755 avsluttet han formelt ekteskapet med Maria. Bestefaren, Vilhelm VIII, landgreve av Hessen, ga grevskapet Hanau og dets inntekter til Maria, den unge prins Karl og hans to brødre, Vilhelm og Fredrik, ble oppdratt av sin mor og fostret av protestantiske slektninger siden 1747. I 1756 flyttet Maria til Danmark for å ta seg av de mindreårige barna til sin søster, dronning Louise av Danmark. Med henne tok hun sine sønner som ble oppdratt ved hoffet på Christiansborg slott i København. De hessiske prinsene forble senere i Danmark, og ble dets viktige herrer, bare den eldste broren Vilhelm vendte tilbake til Hessen i 1785 etter å ha steget opp til landgrevskapet. Karl begynte en karriere i Danmark. I 1758 ble han utnevnt til oberst, i en alder av 20 generalmajor, også i 1766 ble han utnevnt til generalguvernør i Norge, en stilling han hadde til 1768, men som for det meste forble titulær, da han aldri dro til Norge i denne perioden. I 1763 giftet hans eldre bror Vilhelm seg med deres fetter, Karl fulgte etter den 30. august 1766 på Christiansborg slott - hans kone var Louise av Danmark, og Karl ble dermed svoger til sin fetter, kong Christian VII. Ekteskapet fant sted til tross for råd gitt mot det, på grunn av beskyldninger om utskeielser av prins Charles. Kort tid etter falt Karl i unåde ved hoffet, og tidlig i 1767 skulle han og de få sitt første barn, Marie Sophie, der i 1767 og deretter deres andre barn, Vilhelm, i 1769. I 1768 kjøpte Karl eiendommen og landsbyen Offenbach-Rumpenheim av familien Edelsheim. I 1771 fikk han herregården utvidet til et slott og fyrstesete, og hans mor Maria bodde i palasset til sin død i 1772. I 1781 solgte Karl slottet til sin yngre bror, Karl bosatte seg på Gottorp slott i Schleswig sammen med sin familie. De skulle ha sitt tredje barn Fredrik der i 1771, i 1770 ga kong Christian VII sin søster eiendommen Tegelhof i Güby mellom byen Schleswig og Eckernförde. Fra 1772 til 1776 hadde Karl en sommerresidens på stedet som han kalte Louisenlund til ære for sin kone, i september 1772 ble Karl utnevnt til øverstkommanderende for den norske hæren og han og Louise flyttet til Christiana. Tildelingen var en konsekvens av statskuppet til kong Gustav III av Sverige den 19. august 1772, mens i Norge fødte prinsesse Louise sitt fjerde barn Juliane i 1773.<br/><br/>18 år.<br/>Louise Caroline av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline ble født i Gottorp i Hertugdømmet Schleswig til landgreve Karl av Hessen-Kassel og hans hustru prinsesse Louise av Danmark.<br/>–<br/>Prinsesse Louise Caroline<br/><br/>-19.<br/>Fredrik av Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Landgreve Frederick<br/><br/>Tjue.<br/>Prins Vilhelm av Hessen Prins Vilhelm av Hessen<br/>–<br/>Vilhelm av Hessen-Kassel<br/><br/>212223.<br/>Prinsesse Louise 24.<br/>Sophia Frederica av Mecklenburg-Schwerin<br/>–<br/>Sophia Frederica av Me252627 mor28.<br/>Albert Azzo II, markgreve av Milano<br/>–<br/>Alberto Azzo II, markgreve av Milano og Liguria, greve av Gavello og Padova, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice og Montagnana, aka Albertezzo II, var en mektig adelsmann i Det tysk-romerske rike. Han regnes som grunnleggeren av Casa dEste, etter å ha vært leder av den første familien til å være herre over Este, Alberto Azzo II var den eneste sønnen til Albert Azzo I, markgreve av Milano. Han arvet sine fedres embeter rundt 1020, og økte stadig sine eiendommer i Nord-Italia, i årene 1069–1070 forsøkte han å skaffe Maine til sin sønn Hugo, fordi hans hustru, Garsende, var en medarving av de tidligere grevene av Maine. Hugo ble erklært greve, men han kunne ikke seire mot Robert, hertug av Normandie, i Investiture-striden mellom Henrik IV, tysk-romersk keiser, og pave Gregor VII, forsøkte Azzo å mekle, men senere sluttet han seg til pavens side. Rundt 1073 bygde han et slott ved Este sin residens, hvorfra huset Este, før hans byggeprosjekt, Este var lite mer enn en landsby. Hans sønn Welf flyttet først til Kärnten og deretter til Bayern, noe som ga opphav til en av de viktigste familiene i europeisk historie, en annen sønn, Fulko I av Milano, gjorde den første dokumenterte bruken av tittelen Marquis dEste. Azzo II giftet seg med Kunigunde, datter av Welf II, greve av Altdorf, og de fikk et kjent barn, Welf hertug av Bayern fra 1070 til 1077 og fra 1096 til sin død som var det første medlemmet av Welf-grenen av huset Este. Hans andre ekteskap var med Garsende, datter av Herbert I, greve av Maine, og de hadde følgende kjente sønner: Fulco I, markgreve av Milano, stamfar til den italienske grenen av Huset Este Hugo V, greve av Maine, hadde ingen etterkommere. Noen kilder sier at han også giftet seg med Vitalia Orseolo, datter av Peter Orseolo, og han hadde en utenomekteskapelig affære med Matilda, søster av Vilhelm, biskop av Padova, med hvem han hadde en datter ved navn Adelasia som giftet seg med Guglielmo Adelardi.

Han var det første medlemmet av Welf-grenen av huset Este, i slektsforskningen til eldstehuset Welf regnes han som Welf IV. Welf var sønn av Azzo II av Este og hans hustru Kunigunde av Altdorf, da Welfs onkel på morssiden, Welf, hertug av Kärnten, døde barnløs. Welf giftet seg med Ethelinde av Northeim, datter av Otto II, hertug av Bayern, da hans svigerfar, hertug Otto, hadde blitt en fiende av kong Henrik IV og forspilte sitt hertugdømme. I samsvar med Henriks ordrer, forkastet og skilte han seg fra sin hertuginne, Ethelinde, og denne hendelsen fant sted ved Goslar i 1070, da statene i Bayern i stillhet underkastet seg den nyopprettede hertugen, som var representant for en av de eldste familiene i provinsen. Paven og keiseren ble overfladisk forsonet i 1076, men det året så de igjen aktive fiendtligheter. Henrik, som en konsekvens av gjentatte opprør, erklærte Welf avsatt i sitt nyervervede hertugdømme. Med støtte fra sine trofaste bayerere, og med hjelp fra sin far i Italia, var Welf i stand til å opprettholde sin posisjon, men Gregor døde i 1085 og hans etterfølgere tok en mindre intensiv rolle i Tysklands affærer. Etter skilsmissen i 1070 fra sin første kone, giftet Welf seg med Judith av Flandern, datter av Baldwin IV, greve av Flandern, og enke etter Tostig Godwinson, jarl av Northumbria. I 1089 giftet Welfs sønn Welf seg med Matilda av Toscana, og styrket dermed forholdet til paven, men etter at den yngre Welf skilte seg fra Matilda i 1095, gjorde Welf opp med kong Henrik IV og ble gjeninnsatt i sin stilling som hertug av Bayern. Etter at hans far Azzo døde i 1097 forsøkte Welf å skaffe sin fars eiendom sør for Alpene, og i 1099 ble Welf med i det som skulle bli kjent som korstoget i 1101, sammen med Vilhelm IX av Aquitaine, Hugo av Vermandois og Ida av Østerrike. Hans største suksess var å forhindre et sammenstøt mellom andre korsfarere, som hadde plyndret bysantinsk territorium på vei til Konstantinopel, Welf selv unnslapp fiaskoen, men døde på vei tilbake i Pafos, Kypros, i 1101 og ble begravet i Weingarten Abbey.

Som ung mann administrerte han familiene Este sør for Alpene, gjennom sitt ekteskap med Wulfhilde, datter av hertug Magnus av Sachsen, omkring 1095, kjøpte han en del av Billung-godsene rundt Lüneburg. Han ønsket å etterfølge sin svigerfar som saksisk hertug da Magnus døde uten arvinger i 1106. Hertug Henrik opprettholdt likevel nære forbindelser med det regjerende Saliske dynasti, og i 1116 sluttet han seg til keiser Henrik Vs andre italienske felttog for å erobre eiendommene til den sene markgreve Matilda av Toscana. Han etterfulgte sin eldre bror Welf II som bayersk hertug, da sistnevnte døde barnløs i 1120, var Henrik også medvirkende til å få til Wormskonkordatet i 1122, som avsluttet den langvarige Investiture-striden mellom paven og keiseren. Ekteskapet ble inngått i mai 1127, og forholdet mellom Welf- og Hohenstaufen-dynastiet varte fram til 1200-tallet, men etter at Lothar vant valget innførte han et keiserlig forbud mot Fredrik II.

Da Henrik Løve døde i 1195, møtte Vilhelm Otto etter den danske erobringen av Holstein i 1201, Vilhelm Valdemar, bror av kong Knut VI av Danmark i Hamburg, hvor han arrangerte sitt ekteskap med kongens søster Helena. Begge giftet seg våren 1202, ledsaget av en betydelig medgift, og deres eneste barn var Otto, som arvet sin fars eiendom og ble den første hertug av Braunschweig-Lüneburg i 1235. Vilhelm håpet å overta styret i Holstein, men ble skuffet av det danske hoffet, i mai 1202, og Welf-brødrene møttes i Paderborn, hvor de delte sin fars arv. Vilhelm konsentrerte seg om å konsolidere sitt styre, sterkt avhengig av salthandelen rundt Lüneburg, og ved Vilhelms død i 1213 fungerte Otto IV som verge for sin bror Otto den yngre.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Følg oss på sosiale medier<br/><br/>ER DU EN<br/><br/>INNLEDNING<br/><br/>Sukker craving? Her er hva kroppen din prøver å fortelle deg<br/><br/>cialis<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Vektøkning fra ute av kontroll cravings til side, kan det være frustrerende å ha en konstant hankering for noe usunn og ikke vet hvorfor. Den gode nyheten er at det vanligvis er en grunn som ligger til grunn for det brennende ønsket om å huse en pose potetgull, eller følelsen av at du faktisk kan dø hvis du ikke får en pickle rett her og nå (selv om du ikke er gravid). Hvis du for eksempel har visjoner om melkeveisstenger, kan det bety at du mangler et veldig spesifikt næringsstoff i kostholdet ditt. (Yup - det er mer komplisert enn at sjokoladebaren er så darn deilig.)<br/><br/>Vi snakket med Los Angeles-baserte kostholdsekspert Shira Lenchewski, MS, R.D., for å få den tynne på noen vanlige mat cravings, samt hva du kan gjøre for å mette sulten uten å gå overbord. Fortsett å rulle for noen seriøst god informasjon!<br/><br/>Hvis du har lyst på sjokolade<br/><br/>Det betyr: Du kan mangle magnesium i kostholdet ditt, sier Lenchewski. "Magnesium er et viktig mineral som er involvert i energiproduksjon, glukosemetabolisme og muskelfunksjon. Dette gjelder spesielt for de som treffer treningsstudioet hardt," forklarer hun. I tillegg er magnesiumnivået lavere i løpet av de premenstruelle ukene av perioden, noe som forklarer hvorfor PMS så ofte kommer med sjokolade cravings.<br/><br/>I stedet nå for høy kvalitet, lavt sukker mørk sjokolade, som er naturlig høy i magnesium. "Jeg anbefaler å holde seg til 75 prosent kakao eller høyere, og parre den med en annen magnesiumrik kilde som solsikkefrø," sier Lenchewski. Hun foreslår sjokolademerket Hu, et lite matselskap som fokuserer på ingredienser av høy kvalitet produsert lokalt. "Det er litt dyrt, men desto mer grunn til å holde porsjoner i sjakk," sier hun. "Det er min personlige favoritt." Vi er også store fans av superfood-pakket Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Hvis du er sugen på godteri<br/><br/>Det betyr: "Å sulte på rent sukker er en god indikasjon på at du går tom for energi," sier Lenchewski. "Tenk på det. Hva er den ene tingen du klør for etter en forferdelig natts søvn eller rundt 16:00 i løpet av en stressende arbeidsdag? Svaret er vanligvis sukker fordi det brukes som øyeblikkelig drivstoff for kroppens celler.<br/><br/>"Hvis du raider dine kollegers godterilager, anbefaler jeg et mer sakte brennende karbohydrat med en kilde til fett eller protein," sier Lenchewski. "I motsetning til vanlig sukker, vil dette brenne cellene dine mens du unngår post-sukkerkrasj. To alternativer som gjør for stor pick-me-ups neste gang du er sugen på godteri: en skiver eple med ditt valg av mutter smør, eller bær med 2% usøtet gresk yoghurt. Vi liker å knuse en søt tann med disse vanedannende kokosnøttchipsene også - de fyller, fri for tilsatt sukker, og bare så bra.<br/><br/>Hvis du har lyst på salt<br/><br/>Det betyr: "Hvis ingenting annet enn den salteste pickle vil gjøre, kan du ikke drikke nok H2O," sier Lenchewski. "Salt hjelper kroppen til å holde på vann, så vi krever det når vi trenger væske."<br/><br/>I stedet, nå for vann. "Hold deg hydrert, spesielt når vi nærmer oss sommermånedene," sier hun. Neste gang en trang treffer, prøv å slukke den (bokstavelig talt) med noen forfriskende briller, og du kan finne at det haster å natrium binge forsvinner. "Hvis vanlig vann borer deg, prøv å legge til mynte, sitron eller frossen frukt for å blande det opp," sier Lenchewski. Og hvis det fortsatt ikke gjør trikset, er det et sunnere alternativ til poser med chips eller pommes frites. "Hvis du virkelig bare ønsker salt tross alt, er ristet tang et godt kalorialternativ," sier hun.<br/><br/>Hvis du vil ha stivelsesholdige karbohydrater som pasta<br/><br/>Det betyr: "Fordi høy-carb matvarer øke feel-good hormon serotonin, kan stivelse cravings være et tegn på at du trenger en stemning booster," sier Lenchewski.<br/><br/>I stedet, nå for et bad! "Bust ut Epsom salter, fordi det er på tide for noen alvorlige R + R," sier Lenchewski. "Stol på meg. Å hengi seg i en stivelse gratis for alle føles veldig bra i øyeblikket, men det vil trolig bum deg mer ut neste dag." (Som alle som noen gang har overspist en pizza eller pasta craving vet.) Så neste gang du ønsker å dykke hodet først i en bolle med karbohydrater, tegne et bad, tenne et lys, og behandle deg selv uten anger eller tette kalorier.<br/><br/>Hvis du har lyst på iskrem<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Det betyr: "Kroppen din kan fortelle deg at den trenger noe sunt fett."<br/><br/>"Jeg er en realist, så hvis du har lyst på iskrem, kommer jeg ikke til å anbefale en håndfull valnøtter, som selvfølgelig er fulle av sunt fett," sier Lenchewski. "For iskrem nødstilfeller, anbefaler jeg lavere-i-sukker kokos iskrem som Coconut Bliss eller Kippy tre-ingrediens iskrem i Los Angeles." Vi kan stå for det faktum at kokos iskrem smaker utrolig og akkurat som the real thing.<br/><br/>Hvis du vil ha en burger<br/><br/>Det betyr: Du trenger jern. "Hvis du ikke kan slutte å tenke på rødt kjøtt, er det en sjanse for at kroppen din krever jern, b12 og folsyre," sier Lenchewski. "Dette gjelder spesielt i eller rundt den tiden av måneden."<br/><br/>I stedet nå for en sunnere burger. "Jeg er en talsmann for gressmatet, antibiotika og hormonfritt rødt kjøtt en gang i uken," sier Lenchewski. "Prøv å eksperimentere med en åpen bisonburger - som, kuttet for kutt, er slankere og har mer jern enn biff." Ikke spis kjøtt? Prøv å innlemme en slags plantebasert jerntilskudd i rutinen din, som spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Webtjenester, leverandører og cyberlover!<br/><br/>Oppdatert på:april 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Databehandling av denne verden endret menneskelig ytelse scenario i stor grad, og det også utover måling. For eksempel, Nå kan du sende viktig informasjon over hele verden med et enkelt museklikk, takket være Internett-tilkobling. Dessverre, det er denne brede tilkobling og popularitet blant folk, Internett har også økt sjansene for datakriminalitet. Internett forbrytelser eller datakriminalitet er allment kjent som 'Cyber forbrytelser'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' er noe nytt i rettsvesenet, men har fått mye oppmerksomhet i det siste. Begrepet cyberkriminalitet er noe veldig synonymt med konvensjonell kriminalitet, den eneste forskjellen er medium for utførelse. Det er hovedsakelig to typer cyberkriminalitet, den første er der datamaskiner er de viktigste målene, og disse inkluderer tilfeller av dataskade, ondsinnet kode og til og med kriminell datatilgang. Den andre er der datamaskinen er bare et verktøy som bruker som konvensjonelle forbrytelser er begått for f.eks cyber terrorisme, spamming, cyber stalking og mange flere.<br/><br/>Det er her en nettsidekonsulent eller en leverandør kommer inn i bildet. Selv om du ikke er klar over alle cyberlovene som er til stede til dags dato, kan en nettsideleverandør gi deg råd om noen av de mest vitale cyberlovene mens du oppretter nettstedet ditt.<br/><br/>Dette kan inkludere felles kunnskap om kopieringsrettigheter eller til og med beskytte innholdet på ditt eget nettsted. Å forklare deg alle rettighetene du har som eier av nettstedet, er også en av oppgavene en nettsideleverandør kan gjøre mens du utvikler nettstedet ditt. En leverandør kan også hjelpe deg ved å tilby deg informasjon om forskjellige cyberlover for å beskytte data. I tillegg til alt dette kan en leverandør også tilby deg informasjon om ny cyberlov som du kanskje ikke er klar over til du vet. Cyber-lover kan variere fra land til land, et nylig eksempel kan være cookie-loven som er utgitt i Storbritannia, som forhindrer nettstedet i å lagre brukernettleserdata. I henhold til cookie-loven kan nettsteder i Storbritannia ikke lagre cookie-filer uten informasjonssamtykke fra surferen.<br/><br/>Det er etter implementeringen av en slik lov at nettsteder nå har et popup-vindu, som søker samtykke fra den besøkende for å lagre informasjonskapsler. Slike filer brukes av nettsteder for å analysere surfemønsteret til besøkende basert på hvilke annonser som deretter legges ut på et brukervindu. Med hacking ikke lenger en ny ting for oss alle, tror du at slike regler og forskrifter kan forhindre nettforfalskning eller nettkriminalitet? Teknologien har utviklet seg i et raskt tempo, men fortsatt foretrekker folk ikke å handle på nettet på grunn av frykt for at personlige eller bankkontodetaljer blir hacket. Med økningen av cyberkriminalitet har behovet for strenge cyberlover også økt for å dempe det samme og for å fremme en risikofri shoppingopplevelse.<br/><br/>Klasser av cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>I løpet av årene har det vært tre store klasser av cyberkriminalitet:<br/><br/>Uautorisert tilgang til datasystemsaker, som innebærer hacking eller tyveri av brukernavn og passord for å få tilgang til personlig informasjon om den respektive brukeren. Denne typen bakdørstilgang er organisert ved hjelp av Trojan Horse. Utgivelse av ondsinnede programmer som Trojan House, ormer eller datavirus etc. Den siste klassen inkluderer cyber stalking av en bruker eller online trakassering .<br/><br/>Direkte implikasjoner av cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Nedgang i salg<br/><br/>Redusert personalutgang på grunn av nettverksforsinkelser<br/><br/>Tap av personlig informasjon som forskningsarbeid<br/><br/>Forstyrrelse i kommunikasjonsprosessen<br/><br/>Indirekte implikasjoner av cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Troverdighet i vårt finansielle system<br/><br/>Brand image er skjemmet i markedet<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet påvirker forretningsforhold i markedet<br/><br/>Følelsen av tillit til statlig politikk og offentlige etater er tapt<br/><br/>Forebygging av cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Som nettbrukere er det visse forholdsregler som vi bør vurdere for en trygg og sikker online opplevelse. Her er noen av dem:<br/><br/>Det første du må gjøre er å holde personlig informasjon til deg selv og unngå å dele det samme på nettet.<br/><br/>Unngå å dele noen bilder med online chat venner eller fremmede.<br/><br/>Installere den nyeste versjonen av anti-virus på systemet kan gi deg en god forsvarslinje mot Internett-trusler som virus og malware.<br/><br/>Å holde opp av dine verdifulle data er et godt alternativ for å unngå problemer som virus forurensning.<br/><br/>Unngå å sende kredittkortinformasjon til nettsteder som er usikret og ikke har et gyldig sertifikat.<br/><br/>Installere sikkerhetsprogram som gir deg kontroll over nettstedets informasjonskapsler og sparer deg fra å bli sporet av nettsteder.<br/><br/>Å sette vertsbaserte inntrengingsdeteksjonsanordninger på servere vil hjelpe deg med å holde oversikt over uregelmessigheter på nettstedstrafikken din.<br/><br/>Bruk av brannmur anbefales.<br/><br/>Hvorfor er cyberangrep så populære?<br/><br/>Billigere enn tradisjonelle juksemetoder<br/><br/>Det er ikke lett å spore cyberkriminalitet<br/><br/>Nøyaktige steder kan ikke spores enkelt<br/><br/>Fravær av fysiske barrierer i internettverdenen<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalitet rammer mange<br/><br/>Konklusjon<br/><br/>Det faktum at menneskesinnet har ufattelig makt er ubestridelig, og det er derfor internettkriminalitet øker i et enormt tempo. Selv historien har vært vitne til noen av de største Internett-sikkerheten gått kaput av hendene på hackere, som lett har kommet unna også. Den eneste måten å dempe slik kriminalitet er å være klar over cyber lover som vi har i dag, som enten kan være via internett eller gjennom nettside / IT-leverandører. Informasjonsteknologiloven må balanseres på en slik måte at den viser seg å være for streng for folk som er involvert i cyberkriminalitet, og samtidig bør den aldri hindre veksten av Internett-bransjen.<br/><br/>Forfatter Bio: – Maneet Puri er i dag leder en kvalitet webdesign firma ligger i New Delhi, India.
