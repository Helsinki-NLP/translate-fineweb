| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Den historiske bydelen Leclaire, en gang referert til som Edwardsvilles «forstad i sør», ble grunnlagt som et kooperativt samfunn i 1890 og forble en egen landsby inntil den ble annektert til byen Edwardsville i 1934. Aviser og magasiner over hele USA og Europa rapporterte om Leclaire-eksperimentet, spesielt i løpet av de første 20 årene av sin eksistens. I 1979, på grunn av sin unike historie, ble den tidligere landsbyen oppført på National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire ble grunnlagt av Nelson Oliver Nelson, en rørlegger i St. Louis som i mange år forsøkte å fremme arbeiderklassens situasjon. Nelson ønsket å forbedre arbeidsforholdene for sine ansatte og gi boliger i nærheten av fabrikkene, slik at arbeidere og deres familier lett kunne delta i rekreasjons- og utdanningsprogrammer som tilbys gratis av selskapet. Før 1890, mens han fortsatt var i St. Louis, begynte N. O. Nelson Companys produksjons- og distribusjonsvirksomheter å gi profittdeling sammen med utdannings- og rekreasjonsmuligheter. Leclaire-samarbeidseksperimentet ville gi ytterligere fordeler.<br/><br/>Da Nelson-ansatte indikerte at de ønsket å flytte til et landlig sted, kontaktet selskapets representanter ledere av småbyer i flere Missouri og Illinois-samfunn nær deres St. Louis-hovedkvarter. De var på utkikk etter en passende eiendom for å bygge nye fabrikker og en modelllandsby. Sør for Edwardsville fant de et landområde på 125 hektar med tilgang til vann, kull og transport. Lokale forretningsmenn handlet raskt for å tilby et økonomisk insentiv. På mindre enn tre uker samlet samfunnet et fond på $ 20 000 fra individuelle bidrag på mellom $ 1 og $ 1000 for å lokke Nelson til å velge Edwardsville for sin virksomhet.<br/><br/>Byens ledere hadde håpet å lokalisere eiendom innenfor bygrensene til Edwardsville, men da ingen egnet sted kunne bli funnet, var de sikre på at Nelson-investeringen sør for byen snart ville bli en del av Edwardsville. Selv om Nelson oppfylte alle forutsetninger for bygging og jobbskaping i sin kontrakt, ville det være 44 år før annektering til Edwardsville. Leclaire, avgrenset av Madison/Brown Avenues i øst, jernbanesporene i vest, Hadley/McKinley Avenues i sør og Wolf Street i nord, forble en uavhengig landsby fra 1890 til 1934. I løpet av den tiden fikk det et rykte for innovasjoner innen næringsliv, utdanning og boligplanlegging.<br/><br/>Landsbyen Leclaire på et kart fra 1931 over Edwardsville<br/>Gjengitt med tillatelse av Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsons beslutning om å bygge en landsby ble ikke gjort på et innfall. På slutten av 1880-tallet var han en internasjonal leder innen samarbeid og profittdeling, utveksle sosiale teorier med andre rundt om i verden mens han utvidet sin St. Louis-virksomhet. Han oppkalte sin eksperimentelle landsby etter den parisiske profitt-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, men han besøkte mange andre sosiale visjonære som ga informasjon og inspirasjon. Ved å samle de beste ideene fra disse eksemplene, grunnla Nelson Leclaire for å, med sine ord, «gi arbeid, fremme intelligens, gi rekreasjon, fremme skjønnhet og lage hjem.» Senere forfattere brukte disse ordene til å formulere Leclaires grunnleggende prinsipper: arbeid, hjem, utdanning, rekreasjon og skjønnhet, men med det ekstra viktige prinsippet om frihet.<br/><br/>Arbeid<br/><br/>Arbeid kan betraktes som den viktigste av disse faktorene siden uten fabrikkjobbene i Leclaire ville det ikke være noen landsby. Mursteinsfabrikkbygningene ble designet av arkitekt E. A. Cameron for å gi naturlig lys, ventilasjon om sommeren og oppvarmede gulv om vinteren. Det var et brannslukkingssystem, og selv om industriulykker ikke ble eliminert, ble det gjort alt for å garantere arbeidernes sikkerhet. De mursteinsbelagte bygningene var omgitt av velstelte plener og blomsterhager som ga komplekset et campus-lignende utseende. I 1894 kalte New York World reporter Nellie Bly bygningene "den ideelle perfeksjonen av bygninger for mennesket å jobbe i".<br/><br/>Hotell i nærheten av N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company<br/>Venner av Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson selskapspolitikk ble utformet for å beskytte den økonomiske stabiliteten til ansatte. Arbeidere kunne tjene en andel av overskuddet og ha en stemme i selskapet hvis de valgte det alternativet. Fortjenestedelingsplanen ga Nelson-ansatte en eierskapsstolthet som resulterte i en støttende arbeidsstyrke. Det var noen få kortvarige arbeidsstreiker gjennom årene, men for det meste var arbeidsproblemer sjeldne. Arbeiderne hadde også rimelige timer og konkurransedyktig lønn. Det var et omsorgsfond som sørget for pensjoner og sykefravær, samt enkepensjon hvis en arbeidstaker døde, enten dødsfallet var relatert til hans ansettelse eller ikke.<br/><br/>Selskapets hovedkontor for N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) forble i St. Louis, men hele N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company ble flyttet til Leclaire. Produksjonsselskapet ble delt inn i butikker som gjorde en rekke produkter. I 1900 ble butikkene uavhengige selskaper for skattemessige formål, men alle var fortsatt eid av N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Butikkene inkluderte Cabinet Mill hvor treprodukter fra skap til møllearbeid ble produsert. De dyktige håndverkerne som arbeidet her oppfylte også spesielle kontrakter, inkludert kassererbur for en lokal bank og et alter som fortsatt er i bruk i St. Andrew's Episcopal Church i Edwardsville. Marmorbutikken spesialiserte seg på arkitektonisk marmor som ble kuttet og installert av Nelson-mannskaper i hjem, bedrifter og til og med statlige hovedstader over hele Midtvesten. Maskinbutikken, som ble Bignall og Keeler, laget rørmonteringsmaskiner, pumper, målere og ulike mekaniske verktøy som forventes i rørleggerbransjen. De forgrenet seg også til å produsere spesialitetsartikler som Leclaire Bicycle på midten av 1890-tallet. Brass Shop inkluderte et støperi hvor ulike rør og verktøy ble produsert. Disse eksemplene representerer bare noen av arbeidet som ble gjort i Leclaire-fabrikkene. Selskapets logo var en stilisert "NONCO" som fortsatt kan ses på rørleggerarbeid og noen brannhydranter i Edwardsville i dag.<br/><br/>Boliger<br/><br/>Før boliger kunne bygges, var det behov for boliger for arbeidere som fullførte fabrikkbygningene, samt å bygge boliger. For å møte disse behovene bygget selskapet "Club House", en stor bygning som tjente mange formål. I tillegg til overnatting var det samfunnets første utdanningsbygning, og det inneholdt et velfylt bibliotek.<br/><br/>Byggingen av boligdelen av Leclaire begynte umiddelbart etter at landsbyen ble grunnlagt i juni 1890. Julius Pitzman, den innovative landskapsarkitekten som la ut de første tomtene i Leclaire, satte dem opp med en rekke beskyttende pakter. Paktene sørget for brede, buede gater, store tomter og en handlingsbegrensning som begrenset eiendommene til bolig- eller utdanningsformål. Selskapet brolagt gatene, gitt elektriske gatelys, installert fortau, og plantet hundrevis av trær langs gatene i Leclaire. Senere deler av Leclaire ble lagt ut med en konvensjonell grid design og mindre partier, men fortsatt inkludert gjerning restriksjoner.<br/><br/>En Leclaire viktoriansk hytte i 1907<br/>av Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>I utgangspunktet ble hjemmene bygget av selskapet og deretter solgt til nær kostnad for Nelson-ansatte for å oppmuntre til hjemmeeierskap. Hvis en arbeidstaker ble syk og ikke kunne gjøre sitt boliglån, ble betalingene suspendert til etter at han kom tilbake til arbeid. Boligene ble tilbudt i en rekke husdesign og selskapet annonserte at ingen to boliger var like. De tidligste hjemmene var hovedsakelig viktorianske hytter som kom med strøm og rennende vann. Disse ble etterfulgt av bungalower, firkanter, og til og med noen kit hjem. Beboere kunne kjøpe et selskap bygget hjem eller kjøpe en tom tomt og bygge et hus selv, forutsatt at den arkitektoniske utformingen oppfylte selskapets standarder.<br/><br/>I senere år ble tomter solgt til investorer, vanligvis Edwardsville-innbyggere, og mange boliger på 1920-tallet ble bygget av lokale entreprenører som deretter solgte dem til områdets innbyggere.<br/><br/>Utdannelse<br/><br/>Nelson trodde på utdanning for alle, inkludert arbeiderklassen. Pedagogisk programmering begynte med en barnehage på klubbhuset i 1892 og fortsatte i den nye utdanningsbygningen på 722 Holyoake Road. Vanligvis kalt "School House", denne bygningen ga en stor hall for møter og programmer, men hadde flyttbare skillevegger for å dele den inn i klasserommet i løpet av dagen. På kveldene var det danser, møter eller programmer av Leclaire Self-Culture Club som inneholdt ukentlige forelesninger av Washington University professorer eller nasjonalt kjente høyttalere som, som N. O. Nelson, var en del av den sosiale forbedringsbevegelsen ved århundreskiftet. Disse inkluderte Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel «Golden Rule» Jones, og forfatteren Charlotte Perkins Gilman, blant andre.<br/><br/>Barn innskrevet i Leclaire barnehage i 1913<br/>av Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>I de ti årene etter byggingen av utdanningsbygningen i 1895 var det en rekke pedagogiske eksperimenter, inkludert en industriskole, høyskole, kveldsskole og et akademi. Den tidligste og lengstlevende innsatsen var morgenbarnehagen, grunnlagt i 1892, som brukte Fröbel-modellen. Dette toårige programmet var gratis for alle, inkludert Edwardsville-barn, til 1931 da selskapet av økonomiske grunner begynte å belaste undervisning til studenter som ikke var barn av ansatte. Nelson Manufacturing drev en barnehage frem til 1934 da bygningen ble overlatt til Edwardsville School District for en nominell avgift.<br/><br/>Rekreasjon<br/><br/>Båtfolk på Leclaire Lake i 1915<br/>av Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreasjon var et viktig trekk ved Leclaire. Selskapet ga sportsfasiliteter for baseball, tennis og senere fotball. En bowling- og biljardhall ble bygget, og det var en innsjø for båtliv, svømming, fiske eller skøyter om vinteren. Leclaire Park var innredet med naust, mannlige og kvinnelige badehus, og en stor paviljong. Innbyggerne organiserte danser, hayrider, stavebier og andre aktiviteter, og selskapet sponset et band som spilte regelmessig på underholdning i landsbyen eller i Edwardsville. I likhet med de pedagogiske funksjonene i klubbhuset og skolehuset, var fritidsfasilitetene på Leclaire åpne for alle og var ofte et reisemål for Edwardsville og til og med St. Louis-besøkende.<br/><br/>Skjønnhet<br/><br/>Tidlig fotografi av Leclaire Lake<br/>av Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Den siste faktoren Nelson anså for å være viktig for et tilfredsstillende liv, var miljøet. Nelson visste hvor viktig det var å leve sunt. Han verdsatte skjønnheten og rensligheten som kunne bli funnet i landet, og oppfordret alle i Leclaire til å forskjønne sin eiendom ved å plante hager og frukthager. Nelson selv ledet av eksempel, så et selskap drivhus gitt gratis blomster og konkurranser ble holdt for de vakreste verftene. Leclaire ble lagt ut slik at hele landsbyen hadde en park-lignende innstilling fortsatt tydelig i dag.<br/><br/>Frihet<br/><br/>Leclaire Cooperative Store<br/>av Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listet opp fem grunnleggende prinsipper for Leclaire, men moderne forfattere legger til en sjette: Frihet. Alle programmene som tilbys av selskapet var tilgjengelige for ansatte så vel som lokale innbyggere, men ingen var obligatoriske. Friheten til å velge om man ville delta i selskapets programmer eller ikke var helt opp til den enkelte. Innbyggerne i Leclaire kunne jobbe for Nelson Manufacturing eller andre steder, og arbeidere var ikke forpliktet til å bo i Leclaire. Deltakelse i fritids- og utdanningsprogrammer var også valgfritt. Det var også en bedriftsbutikk hvor ansatte kunne handle, men i motsetning til andre bedriftsbyer var ingen i gjeld til bedriftsbutikken. Leclaire Store var et kooperativ hvor medlemmene ble belastet rettferdige markedspriser, men ble deretter betalt kvartalsvis utbytte.<br/><br/>En annerledes firmaby<br/><br/>Alle disse fordelene gjorde Leclaire unik fra andre firmabyer. Men det var også individuelle tilfeller der selskapet viste medfølelse og omsorg for de ansatte. Selskapet stengte fabrikkene og leide ekskursjonstog for å ta arbeidere og deres familier til St. Louis for en dag på 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Når pengene var trange, ville Nelson av og til plassere ekstra penger i hver lønnskonvolutt for å gjøre livet enklere for arbeidere, og hvis han innførte et program som mennene ikke var enige med, snakket de det ut, og så ofte som ikke, ville Nelson reversere seg selv.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson ble født i Lillesand i 1841, og var en kapitalist som trodde på fri virksomhet, men også en sosialist, en tilhenger av "Golden Rule", og en patriot som tjente for Unionen i borgerkrigen. Ved 1900 var han multimillionær, men ved sin død i 1922 hadde han gitt alt bort for arbeiderklassens forbedring.<br/><br/>Selv om Leclaire ikke var Nelsons eneste sosiale eksperiment, regnes det som hans mest vellykkede forsøk. Andre store tiltak for sosial forbedring inkluderte en kjede av kooperative dagligvarebutikker i New Orleans, en barnehage for barn av svarte ansatte i hans Bessemer, Alabama, fabrikker, og et hjem for forbrukere i Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire var kjent internasjonalt som et bemerkelsesverdig og vellykket eksperiment. Det ble beskrevet i New York World ved flere anledninger, men spesielt av reporter Nellie Bly i 1894 som skrev lenge om modellbyen der "Arbeidsspørsmålet er løst og alle glade i en liten landsby i nærheten av St. Louis." Los Angeles Times rapporterte også regelmessig om N. O. Nelson, som gjorde Chicago Daily Tribune og mange andre publikasjoner.<br/><br/>I en tale på Leclaires 15-årsjubileum i 1915 sa Nelson: "Leclaire strekker seg til deg en vid åpen gjestfrihet, og byr deg i dag den letthet og komfort og skjønnhet og inspirasjon som vi nyter hver dag." Mer enn et århundre har gått siden den dagen, men invitasjonen står fortsatt. Beboere og forskere inviteres til å lære om Leclaires historie og vurdere leksjonene som kan læres til fordel for fremtidige generasjoner.<br/><br/>En av de tidligere bygningene i produksjonskomplekset i 2019, som nå fungerer som N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Forfatter Besøker via Zoom eller Skype<br/><br/>Jeg er spent på å besøke med elevene via Zoom eller Skype! Skype er et flott alternativ for skoler / klasser som ikke bringer inn i personlig forfattere, men som ønsker å utforske bøker og poesi, få kontakt med en forfatter, og stille en-til-en-spørsmål.<br/><br/>Omkostninger<br/><br/>Jeg tilbyr 30-45-minutters Zoom eller Skype-besøk med skoler for $ 125 per økt (eller $ 200 for to økter som skjer innen tre timer om morgenen eller ettermiddagen; $ 325 for tre økter på en dag; $ 425 for fire økter på en dag). I hver økt prøver jeg å få barna så aktivt involvert som mulig. Nei, det er ikke den samme typen forbindelse som et personlig besøk tilbyr, men det kan fortsatt være inspirerende og motiverende for barn!<br/><br/>Hva jeg gjør<br/><br/>Hver økt for opptil 50 studenter inkluderer:<br/><br/>5 minutter med teknisk oppsett<br/><br/>3 segmenter av 10ish-minutter hver - Du velger mellom:<br/><br/>Hvordan jeg ble forfatter<br/><br/>Skrive denne boken (du velger hvilken bok jeg fokuserer på)<br/><br/>Lesing (jeg leser noen dikt og barn hjelper meg å lese andre)<br/><br/>Klasseromspresentasjon (studentene dine legger på en lesing eller forestilling for meg - et veldig takknemlig publikum!)<br/><br/>Skrive et dikt sammen<br/><br/>Spørsmål og svar<br/><br/>5 minutter wrap-ups / farvel<br/><br/>Jeg snakker også med klasser av pre-service lærere eller grupper av in-service lærere om poesi og skriving.<br/><br/>Tips til et flott virtuelt besøk<br/><br/>Tips for et vellykket virtuelt besøk<br/><br/>Et av mine mål for virtuelle skolebesøk er å fange interaktiviteten som gjør personlige besøk vellykkede og morsomme. Men sannheten er at noen ganger er det vanskelig å være praktisk talt interaktiv! Timingen synkroniseres kanskje ikke riktig, noe som gjør lesing sammen en utfordring, og det er veldig vanskelig for meg å høre individuelle studenter med mindre de kommer opp og snakker direkte inn i mikrofonen / datamaskinen. Men etter litt prøving og feiling, Jeg har oppdaget noen måter å ha de beste virtuelle besøk mulig. Her er de: 10 måter å gjøre mitt besøk med elevene en flott opplevelse!<br/><br/>Før besøket<br/><br/>Få barna så begeistret som mulig for besøket. Besøk min hjemmeside med dem. Les noen av mine bøker med dem. Samle noen spørsmål studentene har for meg. Alt du gjør på forhånd for å få det til å føles som en stor avtale, vil gå langt mot studentens engasjement.<br/><br/>Plasser videokameraet eller den bærbare datamaskinen med webkamera slik at jeg kan se så mye av publikum som mulig. Det er vanskelig å vurdere studentengasjement når jeg bare kan se et par studenter.<br/><br/>Begrens hver gruppe til 50 studenter. Det er utrolig vanskelig å engasjere store grupper via video.<br/><br/>Jeg vil flytte raskt fra emne til emne eller dikt til dikt. Vennligst minne elevene om at de må lytte nøye for å forstå hva som skjer.<br/><br/>Av og til gjør jeg litt Reader's Theater med studenter. Hvis jeg sender deg noen skriptede studentdeler på forhånd, skriv ut en kopi for hver økt og kutt i stykker om nødvendig.<br/><br/>Under besøket<br/><br/>Når jeg diskuterer en bok, hvis du har den trykte boken, vær så snill å holde den opp for elevene å se.<br/><br/>Du er min stedfortreder. Jeg kan ofte ikke ringe studenter og høre individuelle svar. Så, jeg kan si, "Vi kommer til å få 3 ideer. Rekk opp hånden hvis du har en idé." Så tar DU over, kaller på tre studenter, og kunngjør disse svarene til alle i rommet og til meg.<br/><br/>Velg trygge, utgående studenter for skriptede studentdeler (hvis jeg sender noen på forhånd). Under mine personlige skolebesøk prøver jeg å trekke ut noen av de mindre sikre studentene, men jeg har funnet ut at dette ikke fungerer så bra under virtuelle besøk fordi jeg ikke kan høre dem.<br/><br/>La elevene med snakkende deler sitte foran. Når det er på tide, få dem til å stå opp og minne dem om å snakke høyt.<br/><br/>I virtuelle besøk faller atferdsstyring utelukkende på deg. Jeg kan ofte ikke se nøyaktig hva som skjer, så vær så snill å gå inn etter behov. Hvis det er en stor forstyrrelse, bare be meg om å holde på et øyeblikk, slik at jeg ikke chatter på mens ingen betaler oppmerksomhet:>)<br/><br/>Ta gjerne bilder av meg på skjermen og del på sosiale medier - selv om bilder av meg ofte ser latterlig ut fordi jeg lager morsomme ansikter eller noe mens jeg leser!<br/><br/>Hvis du har noen spørsmål i det hele tatt, bare spør, enten før eller under besøket!<br/><br/>Planlegge en virtuell økt<br/><br/>Er du interessert i å planlegge et virtuelt besøk med meg? Bare send meg en e-post for å sette opp en dato, og vi går derfra |
| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Nyhetsarkiv<br/><br/>Ny bok ser på måter å takle HIV-utfordringer<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis med Marjorie Human som designet omslaget til boken, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>HIV-pandemien har brakt frem det beste og verste i mennesker når det gjelder respons. På den ene siden har det ført til stigmatisering og vold, og på den annen side har det ført til konstruktive og støttende svar fra ulike individer og grupper. En ny bok, Acting on HIV, redigert av professor Dennis Francis, dekan ved fakultetet for utdanning ved University of the Free State, ser på hvordan drama kan brukes til å fremme vital sosial endring, samt individuell atferdsendring.<br/><br/>Handling på HIV tilbyr en systematisk undersøkelse av drama som en tilnærming til å diskutere HIV / AIDS og relaterte holdninger og atferd. Boken er en vitenskapelig tekst og inkluderer arbeidet til noen tjue eksepsjonelt kreative forfattere. Forfattere som har bidratt til boken er blant andre Proff Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) og Yvonne Sliep fra University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>Dette prosjektet startet i 2009 og har tatt mye av min tid til å samle arbeidet til eksepsjonelt kreative forfattere. Forskningen som formidles gjennom boken er original og betimelig, og gir et betydelig bidrag til samtaler om rollen / rollene og betydningen av drama i å løse problemer med HIV og AIDS, sier professor Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Siden Lara Crofts første videospillopptreden i Tomb Raider (1996), har hennes utnytter som en eventyrlysten og kvikk-wited explorer resonert mye med spillere, tjener henne en plass i pantheon av store popkultur tegn. Av den grunn vil vi sette The World of Lara Croft i Storyworld Spotlight fra 22. desember 2021 til 6. mars 2022.<br/><br/>Hvordan lage en Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft ble skapt av studio Core Design, i Derby (Storbritannia), i 1996. Studioet var på utkikk etter en hovedperson for deres kommende et 3D-eventyrspill for PlayStation 1. Et spill i et tredjepersonsperspektiv hvor spillerne vil se hovedpersonen i sin helhet gjennom hver scene.<br/><br/>Som spillet handlet om "raiding mystiske graver dypt under pyramidene", ville hovedpersonen trenger å se eventyrlystne, og har hjernen til å overleve komplekse raiding oppdrag. Etter litt overveielse ble Lara Croft født, en ung, overklasse og helt britisk kvinne, som var like gåtefull og intelligent som hun var tøff og selvsikker.<br/><br/>Suksess og kontrovers<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) var en gjennombruddssuksess for Core Design, som raskt doblet ned på å bygge Tomb Raider 2 (1997) og 3 (1998). En stor del av suksessen ble tilskrevet spillets ledende dame, som fant beundrere både med mannlige og kvinnelige spillere. Dette forbløffet kritikere som bare så Lara Croft som en sexistisk tegneserie.<br/><br/>Utforsk verden av Lara Croft i Storyworld<br/><br/>Denne utstillingen utforsker den vellykkede franchisen i dybden. Den ser på historien til spillene og hvorfor den ledende damen resonerer med så mange mennesker. Det dykker også inn i mysteriet om hva som gjør Tomb Raider-spillene, fra den dype verdensbygningen til de smarte gåtene og fellene, og fra fantastiske fiende- og monsterdesign til karakterdesignet til den legendariske heltinnen.<br/><br/>Tross alt, mysterier er der for å utforske, og har vært i de siste 25 årene.<br/><br/>Billettsalg<br/><br/>Kjøp billetter til Storyworld online med en startdato og inngangstid fra onsdag 22. desember.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Eiendomsmegling ord av dagen: alternativ<br/><br/>Alternativ: En avtale om å holde åpen, for en bestemt periode, et tilbud om å selge eller leie fast eiendom. Et alternativ kan for eksempel brukes til å gi kjøperen tid til å løse spørsmål om finansiering, tittel, reguleringsplan og gjennomførbarhet før du forplikter kjøperen til å kjøpe. Alternativer brukes ofte i landmonteringsprosessen. Opsjonen må støttes av sin faktiske vurdering, separat og uavhengig av kjøpesummen på eiendommen. Ene og alene betraktningen om vederlag er ikke tilstrekkelig bortsett fra i en leieavtale der bestemmelsene i leieavtalen i seg selv er tilstrekkelige betraktninger til å underbygge opsjonen. En opsjon skaper bare en kontraktsmessig rett; det gir ikke optionee noen eiendom i eiendommen. På tidspunktet for opsjonen er signert, selger eieren ikke, og kjøperen kjøper heller ikke eiendommen. Selv om eieren er forpliktet til å selge hvis gitt varsel av kjøperen, er kjøperen ikke forpliktet til å kjøpe. En opsjon til å kjøpe er også kjent som en samtale; en opsjon til å selge er kjent som en put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Fordeler med karotenoider for huden<br/><br/>Har du hørt om karotenoider? Disse kraftige fytokjemikaliene er de pigmenterte bestanddelene som finnes i planter som gir blomster, frukt og etterlater sine gule, oransje og røde farger.<br/><br/>Siden 1930-tallet har forskere identifisert ca 800 karotenoider og ca 40 er funnet i menneskekroppen, inkludert det ytterste laget av epidermis, dermis og subkutant fett. De vanligste karotenoidene er beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaxanthin, lykopen og astaxanthin. Du kan lese mer om astaxanthin her.<br/><br/>Innholdet av karotenoider i huden påvirkes av en rekke faktorer, inkludert inntak av frukt og grønnsaker, deres biotilgjengelighet fra ulike matvarer, tilskudd, eksponering for UV-stråling, luftforurensning, alkoholforbruk, røyking og stress.<br/><br/>Hvordan hjelper karotenoider huden min?<br/><br/>Karotenoider er noen av de mest kjente antioksidantene for huden, og de har også viktige funksjoner som antiinflammatoriske midler.<br/><br/>Sunn aldring og hudreparasjon<br/><br/>Antioksidanter er avgjørende for sunn hud fordi de bidrar til å forhindre skade på frie radikaler til celler. Frie radikaler skader fører til for tidlig aldring og utbruddet av ulike typer hudkreft. Karotenoider, sammen med vitamin E, vitamin C og Co-enzym Q10 er viktige dermale antioksidanter.<br/><br/>På grunn av deres antioksidantaktivitet støtter karotenoider og oppmuntrer kollagen- og elastinproduksjon i huden. Dette bidrar til å øke hudens tetthet, tykkelse, elastisitet og fasthet. Kollagen og elastin reduseres når vi blir eldre, så å få nok karotenoider i kostholdet og lokalt er avgjørende for aldring.<br/><br/>Karotenoider kan forbedre tegn på fotoaldring, hud misfarging, elastisitet, hydrering, tekstur, og kan redusere transepidermal vanntap.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin stimulerer spesielt fibroblaster til å produsere kollagen og elastin, hemmer aktiviteten til enzymene som bryter ned kollagen og elastin, og viser antiinflammatoriske og UV-filtrerende effekter. Det har vist seg å redusere melanin i huden, noe som resulterer i reduksjon i utseendet av fregner og melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-akne aktivitet: Den antiinflammatoriske aktiviteten til karotenoider bidrar til å dempe betennelsen og irritasjonen forbundet med akne. Karotenoider bidrar også til å normalisere og balansere oljesekresjoner fra talgkjertlene. De er verdifulle agenter i huden reparasjon og de stimulerer epidermal regenerering, bidrar til å glatte og myke huden.<br/><br/>Hvor kan jeg finne karotenoider?<br/><br/>Det er to måter å få din daglige dose av karotenoider: gjennom kosthold og gjennom aktuell applikasjon. Kombinasjonen av begge er den ideelle tilnærmingen til godt aldrende hudpleie.<br/><br/>Karotenoider er fettløselige, så kroppen din trenger fett for å absorbere dem (tenk tomater og olivenolje, brokkoli og smør, eller spinat og avokado). Vanlige kilder til karotenoider i mat er avokado, eggeplommer, grønnkål, spinat, gulrøtter, søtpoteter, papaya og tomater.<br/><br/>Mens vi argumenterer for å få så mange av dine næringsstoffer og antioksidanter som mulig fra mat i stedet for tilskudd, viste en studie at astaxanthin kombinert med kollagenhydrolysat forbedret barriereintegritet, redusert transepidermalt vanntap og økt uttrykk for prokollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Aktuelt bruk er nøkkelen til sunn hud. Studier viser at høye konsentrasjoner av antioksidanter i menneskelig hud gir den beste beskyttelsen for sunn hud i alle aldre.<br/><br/>På Sarka Botanicals blander vi karotenoidrike, hele planter som calendula, løvetann og ekstrakter som astaxanthin med kaldpressede oljer og funksjonelle ingredienser. Calendula alene inneholder over 19 forskjellige typer karotenoider. Dette kan forklare hvorfor det har en så lang historie med bruk i hudpleie. Studier viser at karotenoider blandet med koenzym Q10 er spesielt effektive for å redusere betennelse og bremse for tidlig aldring av huden på grunn av soleksponering. |
