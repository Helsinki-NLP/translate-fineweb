In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online HLR-sertifiseringsblogg<br/><br/>Dato: Juli 23rd, 2014<br/><br/>Autosomal dominant interstitiell nyresykdom er en sjelden samling av sykdommer som påvirker de kjente funksjonene i nyrene. Enkelt sagt er tilstanden preget av: man utvikler en nyresykdom og gjennomgår en nyretransplantasjon og andre sykdommer forbundet med sur konsentrasjon i blodet og gikt. I teorien vil tilstanden oppstå selv om den genetiske endringen er arvet fra en forelder og sporadisk oppstår når det ikke er noen familiehistorie.<br/><br/>Vanlige navn på autosomal dominant interstitiell nyresykdom<br/><br/>Tilstanden har også andre navn, nemlig: medullær cystisk nyresykdom, selv om dette navnet ikke brukes så mye fordi de fleste som lider av denne tilstanden ikke har medullære cyster. Det er også referert til som juvenil hyperuricemic nefropati. Sykdommen har en tendens til å påvirke mennesker i alderen 20 til 50. Sistnevnte tilstand som nevnt ovenfor forekommer hos små barn, noe, som oversetter til å få det fra begge foreldrene.<br/>Cystisk nyresykdom er en arvelig tilstand der cystene i midten av hver nyre gradvis mister sin evne til å fungere skikkelig. Cyster refererer til unormale blærer av væske i nyrene. Tilstanden skremmer videre nyrene som ikke klarer å konsentrere urinen og som et resultat produserer for mye urin. Dens symptomer inkluderer overdreven vannlating, saltbehov, svakhet, forvirring, blødning, tretthet, hyppig hikke, lavt blodtrykk, kvalme og oppkast, hodepine, blek hud, redusert følelse i hendene, vekttap blant mange andre. Andre komplikasjoner inkluderer: anemi, sår, tap av bentetthet, infertilitet og andre hjerterelaterte problemer.<br/>Analysen inneholder blodprøver for å sjekke natriumnivåer og generelle nyrefunksjoner, urintester for å sjekke konsentrasjonsnivåer og andre ubalanser, røntgenstråler for å sjekke størrelsen på nyrene som kan endres på grunn av økte urinkonsentrasjoner, nyrebiopsi og genetisk testing for å verifisere eventuelle genetiske endringer som kan ha skjedd i tide.<br/>Mens sykdommen ikke har et kutt og tørr behandling til det, kan man fokusere på å kontrollere tiltak, som inkluderer inntak av væske og salt for å supplere den tapte som sykdommen utvikler seg til senere stadier. Dette bidrar også til å redusere dehydrering. Andre behandlinger inkluderer å ta foreskrevne medisiner og kostholdsendringer og minimalt inntak av matvarer som inneholder fosfor og kalium. Ytterligere komplikasjoner kan også kreve at man har en nyretransplantasjon. I utgangspunktet er dette ikke en herdbar sykdom, men snarere en håndterbar en gang oppdaget i de tidlige stadiene.<br/><br/>Den vanlige, men forskjellige faktoren for autosomal dominant interstitiell nyresykdom<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis og medullær cystisk nyresykdom er hovedsakelig gruppert sammen fordi de i hovedsak deler de samme egenskapene, men med en liten forskjell i arvemønstre til de førstnevnte som påvirker barn og sistnevnte som påvirker unge voksne og eldre aldersgrupper. Lignende egenskaper for begge er ADH-resistent urinkonsentrasjon som fører til polyuri og polydipsi, anemi og nyresykdommer.<br/>Den tidligere nevnte tilstanden er autosomal recessiv regnskap for 15% av kroniske sykdommer og forårsaker ESRD i tidlig barndom, mens sistnevnte er autosomal dominant med noen sporadiske nye mutasjoner og forårsaker ESRD for personer mellom 30 og 50 år. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Lockes redegjørelse for naturtilstanden<br/><br/>Emne: FilosofiOrd: 2539Sider: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes og Locke er blant de mest innflytelsesrike politiske filosofene som noen gang har skrevet på engelsk. Naturtilstanden, som går forut for organiseringen av de komplekse samfunnene, er det felles premisset som både Hobbes og Locke deler, men tolker på forskjellige måter. De førstnevnte ser på menneskene i deres naturlige tilstand som like farlige og frie til å forfølge sine egoistiske mål uhindret av de ikke-eksisterende forestillingene om rettferdighet, og derfor utgjør deres naturlige tilstand «ethvert menneskes krig mot ethvert menneske» (Hobbes). Sistnevnte, derimot, ser mennesker i sin opprinnelige tilstand som like verdifulle og begrenser naturlig frihet ved ideen om rettferdighet som krever ikke å skade andre, noe som gjør det mulig å definere naturtilstanden som "gjensidig hjelp og bevaring" snarere enn krig (Locke 15). Hovedforskjellen mellom de to filosofenes redegjørelser av naturlig tilstand er at Locke bruker etiske hensyn mens Hobbes ikke gjør det, og det fører til slutt Hobbes til å forestille seg en stat som utøver ubegrenset makt over mennesker, mens Locke begrenser regjeringen ved de moralske prinsippene, som han anser som en naturlig lov.<br/><br/>Hobbes baserer sine antagelser om naturens tilstand på det faktum at alle mennesker er omtrent like i deres fysiske og mentale evner. Han innrømmer at noen individer kan vise større fysisk styrke eller overlegen intellekt, men insisterer på at "når alt er regnet sammen, er forskjellen mellom mann og mann ikke så betydelig" (Hobbes 74). Siden mennesker er omtrent like i sine evner, har de også lignende håp om å oppnå sine mål og tilfredsstille sine behov (Hobbes 75). Som et logisk resultat av denne likheten, når folk begynner å konkurrere om knappe ressurser, kan ingen føle seg helt trygge i sine eiendeler. Selv om en mektig, utspekulert og dyktig person lykkes i å undertvinge "personene til alle mennesker han kan", garanterer det fortsatt ikke den ultimate sikkerheten (Hobbes 75). Ettersom intet menneske kan oppnå en slik overlegenhet over de andre som gjør ham eller henne fullstendig immun mot deres intellektuelle styrke, kan intet menneske føle seg helt trygg når han eller hun er omgitt av sine likemenn. Hobbes 'likhet i den naturlige tilstanden er likestilling av frykt, hvor alle mennesker ser på hverandre som farlige konkurrenter.<br/><br/>Akkurat som Hobbes anser Locke alle mennesker for å være fundamentalt likeverdige, men tildeler en helt annen mening til begrepet. Fra hans perspektiv er det ikke likestilling av evner, men snarere likestilling av verdi. Han mener at folk "promiskuøst født til alle de samme fordelene i naturen" bør logisk nyte perfekt likestilling blant dem, da det ikke er noen grunn til å vurdere noen iboende mer verdifulle (Locke 8). Det eneste mulige grunnlaget for å utpeke noen mennesker som overlegne andre ville være hvis Gud "ved enhver åpenbar erklæring om hans vilje, satte den ene over den andre" (Locke 8). Siden en slik guddommelig sanksjon av overlegenhet er fraværende, konkluderer Locke med at den naturlige likestilling av alle representanter for menneskeheten ikke skal settes spørsmålstegn ved. Hobbes nærmer seg likestilling pragmatisk og understreker at mennesker i sin naturlige tilstand er like farlige, men Locke bruker en etisk tilnærming og understreker at mennesker er like verdifulle i Guds øyne. Denne uenigheten er bare den første forskjellen mellom de to forfatterne basert på det faktum at Locke inkluderer Gud som en premiss i sin politiske filosofi, mens Hobbes ikke gjør det.<br/><br/>Et annet karakteristisk trekk ved Hobbes' redegjørelse av den naturlige tilstand er hans tolkning av frihet. Ifølge Hobbes innebærer naturtilstanden ubegrenset frihet til å gjøre det som er nødvendig for ens fortsatte eksistens. Filosofen definerer frihet som "fraværet av eksterne hindringer" i å bruke ens evner til å oppnå ens mål (Hobbes 79). Det primære formålet med hvert sansende vesen er å opprettholde sin fortsatte eksistens. Som en konsekvens utgjør Hobbesian frihet den uhindrede muligheten til å gjøre noe som, etter ens vurdering, ville være best egnet til å bevare ens liv og eiendeler (Hobbes 79). Den eneste begrensningen på frihet er at en person ikke kan gjøre noe motstridende for å opprettholde sitt liv eller ødelegge "midlene for å bevare det samme" (Hobbes 79). Bortsett fra det er det ingen grenser, og alle har "rett til alt, selv til hverandres kropp" hvis det fremmer ens overlevelse (Hobbes 80). Naturlig frihet, som sett av Hobbes, er fraværet av eksternt påtvungne hindringer for å forfølge ens rett til alt for å opprettholde og sikre ens fortsatte eksistens.<br/><br/>Locke opprettholder også ideen om naturlig frihet, men ikke overraskende nærmer han seg det på en måte som er vesentlig forskjellig fra Hobbes. Så snart han begynner å diskutere frihet i naturtilstanden, bemerker han umiddelbart at en tilstand av frihet ikke tilsvarer "en tilstand av lisens" (Locke 9). Filosofen identifiserer to spesifikke begrensninger for menneskelig frihet i naturtilstanden. Den første er identisk med den som Hobbes introduserte: uansett hvor fri og uavhengig en person er, «har han ikke frihet til å ødelegge seg selv» (Locke 9). Ifølge Locke har ethvert menneske en naturlig plikt til ikke å "skade en annen i hans liv, helse, frihet eller eiendeler" (9). På samme måte som med hans tolkning av likhet, baserer forfatteren denne påstanden på etiske og religiøse grunner: folk bør bevare hverandres eksistens siden de alle er skapt av den samme "allmektige og uendelig kloke skaperen" (Locke 9). Dermed begrenser Lockes frihet i den naturlige tilstanden langt strengere enn Hobbes ved å innføre plikten til å avstå fra å skade både seg selv og andre.<br/><br/>Forskjellene mellom de to forfatterne manifesterer seg også i deres redegjørelser om rettferdighet i menneskehetens naturlige tilstand. For Hobbes er avgrensning av rettferdig og urettferdig praksis bare et spørsmål om loven. Det er ingen rettsvitenskap i naturtilstanden, og den eneste loven som styrer mennesker i sin opprinnelige tilstand er en naturlov som bare forplikter dem til å søke personlig sikkerhet. Som et resultat kan ingenting være urettferdig i menneskehetens opprinnelige tilstand: "forestillinger om rett og galt rettferdighet og urettferdighet" har ingen plass og ingen mening i fravær av den strengt håndhevede loven (Hobbes 78). Så lenge folk bruker sin tilnærmet ubegrensede frihet til hensynsløst å konkurrere med hverandre om ressurser, som de har like rett til, har de ingen kriterier for å skille mellom rettferdige og urettferdige handlinger. Derfor trosser den hobbesianske naturtilstanden selve ideen om rettferdighet, siden forfatteren tolker den som en funksjon av den formaliserte og etablerte loven.<br/><br/>Locke tildeler ulik betydning til rettferdighet og ser det ikke så mye i lovgivende som i etiske termer. Dette papiret har allerede nevnt at Locke, i motsetning til Hobbes, bruker etiske begreper og generelt baserer sin politiske filosofi på moralske snarere enn rent praktiske forutsetninger. Lockes naturlov, i motsetning til Hobbes, forplikter mennesker til å ta vare på hverandre i stedet for bare å la alle klare seg selv. Som et resultat er det et sted for rettferdighet og urettferdighet i hans naturtilstand. Forfatteren påpeker dette faktum selv når han bemerker at ingen bør frata en annen av hans eller hennes liv av midler til å bevare det "med mindre det er å gjøre rettferdighet mot en lovbryter" (Locke 9). Denne uttalelsen avslører med den største klarhet at det ifølge Locke er rettferdighet i naturens tilstand, og dessuten må mennesker aktivt bevare den. Rettferdighetskriteriet, som Hobbes naturlige tilstand mangler, er den andre begrensningen på naturlig frihet pålagt av Locke: en handling er urettferdig hvis den utgjør en uberettiget trussel mot en annen persons liv og eiendeler.<br/><br/>Disse forskjellene i de to forfatternes behandling av likhet, frihet og rettferdighet eller urettferdighet kulminerer i deres tolkning av forholdet mellom naturtilstanden og krigstilstanden. Fra Hobbes perspektiv er de to synonyme, fordi den hensynsløse konkurransen er det eneste logiske resultatet av å sette mennesker med tilsvarende evner og lignende behov i et miljø med begrensede ressurser. Han fastslår denne sammenhengen direkte: "Hvis to menn ønsker det samme, som de likevel ikke begge kan nyte, blir de fiender" og er derfor i krigstilstand med hverandre (Hobbes 75). Men siden mennesker er mange og alle har lignende evner og behov, manifesterer denne konkurransen seg ikke bare i de individuelle samspillet, men også på menneskehetens nivå som helhet. Så lenge alle mennesker har lik og ubegrenset rett til alle ressurser og til og med til hverandres kropper og liv, er naturtilstanden en krig «hvert menneske mot hvert menneske» (Hobbes 76). Denne dystre tolkningen stammer direkte fra Hobbes' skildring av naturtilstanden som styres utelukkende av individenes egoistiske drifter.<br/><br/>Locke skiller derimot mellom naturtilstanden og krigstilstanden og påpeker at selv om de kan forekomme samtidig, er det ingen grunn til å identifisere den ene med den andre. Lockes definisjon av krigstilstand er tilnærmet identisk med den som tilbys av Hobbes. Ifølge Locke, "den som forsøker å få en annen mann i sin absolutte makt, setter dermed seg selv i en krigstilstand med ham" (14). Denne forklaringen stemmer perfekt overens med den hobbesianske forestillingen om at alles universelle rett til alt, inkludert andres kropper og liv, fører til krigstilstand. Likevel nekter Locke å likestille krigstilstanden med naturtilstanden nettopp fordi han nekter Hobbes sin tolkning av naturlig frihet. Siden Lockes naturlige tilstand hindrer folk i å skade hverandre gjennom den andre begrensningen av frihet, er et forsøk på en annen persons frihet et brudd på naturloven. Mens for Hobbes, er krig menneskehetens tilstand som standard, portretterer Locke det som en perversjon av naturens tilstand i stedet for dens regel.<br/><br/>Disse forskjellene i avgrensning av staten på naturen og dens bestanddeler, som frihet, likhet, rettferdighet og krig, baner vei for forfatterne i motsetning til regjeringens skildringer. Basert på hans pessimistiske vurdering av naturens tilstand, konkluderer forfatteren av Leviathan med at det under krigsforhold ikke kan være noe bestemt håp om å "leve ut den tiden som naturen vanligvis tillater menn å leve" (Hobbes 80). Løsningen er å fastsette den universelle retten til alt og etterlate alle «så mye frihet mot andre mennesker, som han ville tillate andre mennesker mot seg selv» (Hobbes 80). Deltakerne i den resulterende sosiale kontrakten investerer de ubegrensede frihetene de har overgitt til en suveren - bæreren av den høyeste makten hvis formål er å bevare den oppnådde status quo ved å straffe alle overtredelser mot den. Suverenitetens makt er absolutt: herskeren har myndighet "til å gjøre det han mener er nødvendig" for å fremme fred mellom sine undersåtter, slik at ingen ville angripe en annens liv eller eiendom. Hobbes konkluderer med at uten en slik uangripelig skikkelse som har rett til å gjøre hva som helst med undersåttene, kan det ikke bli fred og ingen garanti for sikkerhet.<br/><br/>Mens Locke er enig i nødvendigheten av å skape politisk organiserte samfunn, motsetter han seg likevel Hobbes idé om suveren makt som ubegrenset og uangripelig. Som nevnt ovenfor er Lockes naturtilstand ikke på langt nær så forferdelig som den som ble malt av Hobbes på grunn av folkets forpliktelse til å bevare ikke bare seg selv, men også hverandre. Derfor oppstår behovet for sosial kontrakt ikke fra frykten for andre, men fra selve bekvemmeligheten. Små samfunn trenger kanskje ikke mange lover for å løse konflikter og "offiserer for å overvåke prosessen", men større foreninger finner det tilrådelig å etablere regjeringer for dette formålet (Locke 57). Men regjeringens makt kan ikke være ubegrenset fordi den ville føre til at undersåttene ble underkastet en «ustadig, usikker, ukjent, vilkårlig vilje hos et annet menneske» (Locke 17). En slik regjering ville utgjøre et dobbelt brudd på naturlovene. Ved å godta en annen persons absolutte makt over sitt liv, ville et emne bryte sin første begrensning som forbyr å skade seg selv. Når det gjelder herskeren, ville ødeleggelse av en annen persons frihet utgjøre direkte skade og som sådan være i strid med den andre begrensningen.<br/><br/>Som en direkte fortsettelse av hans sak om ubegrenset myndighet, benekter Hobbes at maktdeling er et prinsipp. Fra hans perspektiv har suverenen, når den først er innstiftet, «hele makten til å foreskrive reglene» som styrer livene til undersåttene eller, i kortere termer, den lovgivende makten (Hobbes 114). Suverenen forbeholder seg også retten til å "høre og avgjøre alle kontroverser" - det vil si den dømmende makt (Hobbes 114). Til slutt, siden hele formålet med suverenen er å tvinge undersåttene til å avstå fra å skade hverandre, kan det ikke være noen tvil om at utøvende makt også er hans eller hennes eksklusive privilegium. Adskillelsen av krefter som et konsept er fremmed for Hobbes på grunn av hans syn på naturens tilstand. Å skape en politisk enhet der de utøvende, lovgivende og rettslige grenene ville sjekke hverandre - det vil si konkurrere - ville bety å gjenskape den Hobbesianske tilstanden av natur-som-krig på et høyere nivå. Siden folket går inn i en sosial kontrakt og innfører en regjering for å legge naturtilstanden bak seg, ikke gjeninnføre den i en annen form, er maktfordelingen direkte i strid med Hobbes' syn.<br/><br/>Locke, derimot, omfavner maktdeling som et grunnleggende prinsipp i sin politiske teori. Hans sak for separasjon er tydelig i diskusjonen om grensene for den lovgivende makt. Som Locke uttrykker det, ville det neppe være tilrådelig «for de samme personer som har makt til å lage lover, å også ha makt i sine hender til å gjennomføre dem» (76). Filosofen peker på ufullkommenhetene i menneskets natur og det iboende ønsket om å "gripe makten" som en begrunnelse for dette forsiktighetstiltaket (Locke 76). Akkurat som i Hobbes' tilfelle, stammer Lockes redegjørelse av maktdelingen direkte fra hans tolkning av naturens tilstand. Hvis det allerede er rettferdighet i naturtilstanden, og folket kan forstå det, er enhver regjering uunngåelig underlagt den samme naturloven. Siden absolutt makt over mennesker bryter begge begrensningene i denne loven, er det tilrådelig å skille og distribuere det slik at regjeringen ville fungere på riktig måte.<br/><br/>Denne artikkelen har vist at selv om forskjellene mellom Hobbes og Lockes redegjørelser av menneskehetens naturlige tilstand er mange, utgjør de til slutt tilstedeværelsen av fravær av moralske premisser. Hobbes ser på den naturlige tilstanden som ubegrenset frihet, hvor folk utstyrt med like evner og ikke bundet av noen moralske forestillinger, som rettferdighet, konkurrerer om ressursene uopphørlig. Locke tolker imidlertid likhet og frihet etisk snarere enn praktisk og mener at krig er en perversjon av naturtilstanden, da naturloven forplikter mennesker til ikke å skade hverandre. Hobbes insisterer på en allmektig hersker, ettersom, i fravær av etiske begrensninger, ingen annen autoritet kunne tvinge menneskene til å avstå fra å skade hverandre. Likevel, etter Lockes syn, ville det å gi regjeringen ubegrenset makt være i strid med de etiske begrensningene som er innebygd i naturloven, og det er derfor han, i motsetning til Hobbes, fortaler for separasjon av makt. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Motepolitiet: Hva Game of Thrones kastet opp<br/><br/>Den kanadiske-franske sangeren Abbas Hasan satte blindende innsats for å overgå hele menneskeheten på Fashion Parade 2014. Ingenting galt med det, bortsett fra sikkerhet er prioritet og musikeren er en helsefare her.<br/><br/>Vi får han ønsker å være en stjerne. Dessverre, han fikk ikke notatet der de forteller den desperate og den beryktede at stjernestatus er en metafor. Du trenger ikke å se ut som en og bokstavelig talt sette øynene våre i brann. Også, All Pakistan Aunty Association har offisielt innlevert en klage mot ham. Det lokale markedet har kjørt tørr av falske krystaller og paljetterte monstre. De har ingenting å ha på seg til sine to uker høye teer, og de hevder at han er å klandre. Tilsynelatende er antrekket inspirert av Game of Thrones. Kan han vennligst holde seg til å komponere triste sanger om naboens døde hund i stedet for å konseptualisere antrekk? Eller kanskje det er traumer av å miste hunden, hvis død han tydeligvis ikke er over som han fortsatt bærer sin kadaver.<br/><br/>Ladearket Outfit<br/><br/>Ingen kan bestemme hvor antrekket begynner og hvor Abbas slutter. Du stirrer i fascinasjon, synker inn i en dyp avgrunn og lurer på hvorfor han har på seg skinnbukser. Hvis hest drepte han for å stjele salen drapert over skuldrene? Var han i fengsel rett før hans røde løperen utseende og glemte å ta av kjedene? Hvordan vil han overleve syntetisk skinn og post-sequin utslett som er bundet til å være dødelig i så høy dose? Hvorfor er jeg fortsatt i live?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>Hans inspirasjon var tilsynelatende Game of Thrones, men han endte opp med å se ut som han ble kastet ut av en vikingrestaurant. Hadde han kommet over noen av karakterene fra showet, ville han ha blitt drept i de første fem sekundene av den første episoden.<br/><br/>Psykisk helse eller mangel på det: Noen få ham til en rådgiver ASAP! Han synes å være under forutsetning av at iført en død hund betyr at den eneste vennen han hadde i sitt liv er fortsatt i live. Kjære Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Benektelse er ikke en elv i Egypt<br/><br/>2. Din torturerte psyke hjelper ikke musikken din, så få hjelp<br/><br/>3. Prøv imaginære venner<br/><br/>Kausjon!<br/><br/>Alle oss på Fashion Police hovedkvarter er alvorlig traumatisert. Abbas er noen vi ikke likte å arrestere. Han er for tiden i varetekt og forsøker hevn ved å sette på seg antrekk fra andre fantasy-show. Han bare glitter limt seg for å se ut som Edward Cullen fra Twilight. Som en offentlig tjeneste melding og for å hindre ytterligere nervøs sammenbrudd, ga vi ham følgende eksempler på menn fra den røde løperen av samme hendelse.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Når du er i tvil, spill det trygt. Sangeren ser ut som din gjennomsnittlige onkel på en shaadi. En vanlig svart dress uten tilbehør, selv om det er litt uforholdsmessig, er brukbar. Zohaib utseende er blandet inn i alt og ingenting, og når du ikke har en motefølelse eller penger til å ansette en stylist, er dette greit. Det bærer ikke risikoen for hjertestans for andre deltakere på et arrangement. Gitt Abbas' skjøre mentale tilstand, er dette blikket det han burde sikte etter.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>En dag, etter flere tiår med terapi, kunne Abbas strebe etter å ha på seg antrekk som Ali Zafars. Den dapper sommerutseende er gjort til nær perfeksjon. Ali kom veldig nær å se ut som en maître d på en fransk restaurant med sin hvite sommerjakke med svarte lapels, men skjorten sparer det, uansett satengen. Buksene hans ville ha vært latterlige hvis de ikke hadde blitt brettet ved anklene. Skoene er hva hipster chic happy endings er laget av. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Bestemme jord hydrauliske egenskaper med ulike fuktevæsker: En avhandling innsendt i delvis oppfyllelse av kravene til graden av Master of Science ved Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstrakt<br/><br/>Jordhydrauliske egenskaper som hydraulisk ledningsevne, vannretensjon og plantevannsforhold dominerer vannbevegelsesprosessene. For eksempel infiltrasjon, fordampning og vannstrøm i jorda. Som et utbredt fenomen i jord, endrer jordvannavstøtning jordhydrauliske funksjoner ved å motstå vannstrømmen inn i jorda. Videre er de hydrauliske egenskapene ikke bare avhengig av jordporesystemet, men påvirkes også av de fysisk-kjemiske egenskapene til poreoverflatene. Sammenlignet med vann påvirkes etanol ikke av vannavstøtende på grunn av dens lavere overflatespenning. Hensikten med å bruke etanol er å eliminere effekten av jordvannavvisning på hydrauliske egenskaper målinger. Imidlertid kan påføring av ren etanol i naturlig jord forringe jordens organiske materialer og føre til endringer i fysiske egenskaper. De vandige etanoloppløsninger kan derfor være et alternativ, men muligheten for å anvende vandig etanol for å bestemme væskeretensjonskurven i jord er fortsatt ukjent. Denne undersøkelsen tar sikte på å undersøke muligheten for vandige etanolløsninger (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % og 100 % v/v) for å etablere væskeretensjonskurve under et lite trykkområde i grove sandprøver med forskjellig fuktbarhet og organisk modifisert naturlig jordsmonn (Templeton silt loam (TSL) med soppkompost, biokull, meieri % avløpsvannet, og kommunaltvannet). Resultatet viste at desorpsjonen av vandige etanoloppløsninger sammenlignet med vann var ca. 1 til 3 ganger raskere basert på væskeinnholdet ved det samme påførte trykk og tiden for å nå hver likevekt. Resultatene fra sandeksperimentet antydet at når konsentrasjonen av vandig etanolløsning var under 50%, var tapene via fordampning mindre enn 1% og de relative forskjellene mellom testvæske og vann var lavere enn 10%. Fordampningstapene var imidlertid 11,06 % og 24,6 %, og de relative forskjellene var alle rundt 15 % og 30 % i henholdsvis 50 % og 100 % etanolløsning. I motsetning til dette økte de organiske modifikasjonene i Templeton silt loam ikke bare vannretensjonskapasiteten, men reduserte også fordampningstapene. Fordampningstapene i TSL-jord og TSL-jord med organiske modifikasjoner var med 1 % i løsninger med mindre enn 50 % etanolinnhold.Fordampningstapene på 50 % og 100 % etanol var henholdsvis 2,8 % og 2,9 %. De relative forskjellene mellom vann og testvæske var lik sandeksperimentet når testvæskekonsentrasjonene var under 50%. De relative forskjellene i 50 % og 100 % etanoloppløsning var imidlertid mindre enn i sandprøven med henholdsvis ca. 10 % og 15 %. I tillegg antydet analysen av relativ forskjell at nesten alle vandige etanolløsninger hadde lavere volumetrisk væskeinnhold ved det samme tilførte trykk sammenlignet med vann, som var en refleksjon av at de vandige etanolløsninger desorberte raskere enn vann under ekvivalent trykk. Derfor kan 10–40 % av etanolløsningene betraktes som et alternativ til å bestemme jordhydrauliske egenskaper på grunn av deres raskere desorpsjonshastighet og at de ikke påvirkes av jordvannavvisning. På grunn av fordampning og oppløsning av organisk materiale var vandige etanolløsninger over 50% konsentrasjon ikke egnet for grov sand eller middels teksturert jord.... [Vis full abstrakt] |
