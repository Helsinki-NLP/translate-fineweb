So an abundant and essential source of energy that would be used in space for the space colony would be solar radiation by developing satellite solar power stations. To live in space, humans must be protected from the fierce intensity and penetrating wavelengths of unattenuated sunlight, but this same energy is one of the primary resources of space. The colony will have to have enough energy to maintain a fairly uniform temperature even though it is apace. The sun shines twenty-four hours a day and is not dimmed by an atmosphere. Shaded materials not exposed to direct sunlight will almost be at absolute zero. While the temperature in closed bodies exposed to the sun can soar above the boiling point. The colony will need to have both heaters and air conditioners. On the other hand, this sun's energy can be converted into electricity in the colonies. It will be converted with ten percent efficiency to electrical power which is sold at a rate of .012 kw/hr, a square kilometre of space would return more than $14,000,000 each year. Converting solar power to electricity in space, we would build satellite solar power stations that would intercept the sunlight and convert it into electricity. The satellite solar power stations would intercept enough sunlight to replace five nuclear reactors or coal plants. The stations could be as big as nine miles long and four miles wide and it would only weigh twenty thousand tons. It would be built with hollow triangular girders made of aluminum that is very fast and easy to build . Solar power satellites are a pollution free way to generate electricity and cost no more than coal or nuclear energy. There has been twomajor designed stations made so far.

Għalhekk sors abbundanti u essenzjali ta' enerġija li jintuża fl-ispazju għall-kolonja tal-ispazju jkun radjazzjoni solari billi jiġu żviluppati stazzjonijiet tal-enerġija solari bis-satellita. Biex jgħixu fl-ispazju, il-bnedmin għandhom ikunu protetti mill-intensità ħarxa u t-tulijiet ta' mewġ ta' dawl mhux mittiefsa, iżda din l-istess enerġija hija waħda mir-riżorsi primarji ta' l-ispazju. Il-kolonja se jkollha biżżejjed enerġija biex iżżomm temperatura pjuttost uniformi għalkemm hija l-ispazju. Ix-xemx għandha għoxrin siegħa kuljum u mhix imdim mill-atmosfera. Materjali imħaffrin li mhumiex esposti għax-xemx diretta kważi se jkunu f'żero assoluta. Waqt li t-temperatura f'korpi magħluqa hija esposta għax-xemx tista 'fuq mill-punt tat-togħlija.Il-kolonja se jkollha kemm il-ħiters kif ukoll il-kundizzjonaturi tal-arja. Min-naħa l-oħra, l-enerġija ta' dan ix-xemx tista' tiġi kkonvertita fl-elettriku fil-kolonji.

| With the role of the media being crucial<br/><br/>With the role of the media being crucial in the promotion of development the Tonga also sought to curtail the media blackout by establishing a community radio station. In 2007 they established the Tonga on air. It was meant to cater for the Tonga who had not been receiving coverage from the state media. The establishment of the radio station was a move aimed at providing the Tonga with access to information and giving Tonga arts and culture exposure. Mudimba points out to the significance of the radio station basing on the fact that the Tonga did not have any radio or television signal for years and that the establishment of Tonga on air would give the BaTonga community the chance to be informed as well as the chance to reach out to the general populace.<br/>The establishment of the radio at Sinazongwe was aided by a team of Austrian radio activists was primarily aimed at improving communication and access to information in the marginalised remote area. The station was at Sinanzongwe Basic School and had the capacity to cover a radius of 20 kilometres reaching out to approximately 10000 people and was meant to serve the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi<br/>For a marginalised community like the Tonga a community radio station can be used as a means for articulation and self-representation which not only helps in strengthening self-consciousness , identity , and culture but it is also an apparatus of communication which contributes to the emancipation and autonomy of a people in a region dominated by political crisis and gives impulse to a vivid public discourse on culture , society and politics. In that way a community radio station will is broad promoter of public discourse.. it facilitates for equal medial participation as it is open to more democratic and self-organised as it is open to the community. The Tonga on air project has also facilitated for the re-joining of families which were once separated by the construction of the Kariba dam. A community radio station also influences change in media policy as it forwards. The radio station also helped in bridging the information gap. It also offers educational programmes in Tonga thus it is very audible to the targeted community<br/>Establishment of a Community Museum<br/>Also as a way of promoting and developing Tonga language and culture the BaTonga also established a community museum at Binga centre. The museum has played a significant role in revitalising Tonga language and culture. BaTonga Museum (2012) the museum known as BaTonga Museum was established in 2000 with the help as a concerted effort between the Tonga community and MS Zimbabwe a Danish non-governmental organisatiion.as highlighted above in community ladened with stereotypes and misconceptions which have led to the near extinction of Tonga language and culture the museum serves as a platform to rewrite the history of the Tonga through the various programmes it carries out. BaTonga Museum (2002) the main objective of the museum is to demystify Tonga culture and create awareness about the Tonga locally, nationally and internationally.it also seeks to rebuild self-esteem and dignity amongst the Tonga. Furthermore besides promoting and preserving Tonga language and cultural material the museum also works in support of the livelihoods of Tonga artists by buying artefacts for display in the gallery. Since ones culture is also conveyed through arts the museum has played a very significant role in this respect. The museum also hosts a number of cultural events which are e With the above objectives in mind the establishment of BaTonga Museum by the Tonga community can be deemed a good developmental initiative as it helps to promote the recognition of the Tonga people. According to Chikozho the curator of the museum the museum has made a major contribution towards the restoration of the Tonga social fabric. He attributes his assertion to the role the museum has played in Binga district and in Zimbabwe at large. The museum has acted as a source of information to both the Tonga and the general populace. By taking responsibility of buying Tonga cultural material the museum has both supported Tonga livelihoods and the promotion and preservation of Tonga culture. Previously Tonga artefacts were being sold on the informal market and exported out of the country at low costs and were sold at very huge prices and in some instances they would be given alien names which meant that the Tonga were being exploited. Such a scenario did not do the Tonga good thus the museum's role in protecting Tonga cultural material is a way of promoting development amongst the Tonga through promoting their culture. The museum is also a resource centre as everyone whom wishes to learn about Tonga culture is referred to it in as far as Tonga history and culture is concerned.<br/><br/>The Introduction ICT amongst The Tonga<br/>The Tonga through the help of donors has also made efforts to promote access to modern technology by introducing ICT to the Tonga community. They launched the Tonga Online project in 2001. The establishment of the project was facilitated by the Kunzwana Trust which worked with the Austrian Zimbabwean friendship association. Since its launch the Tonga online project has primarily focused on promoting a Tonga voice over the internet. The projects objectives are to provide the Tonga access to the worlds most advanced communication tools which will enable them to represent themselves to the outside world and reflect upon the social, political and economic environment of both the global village in which the Tonga live.<br/>The project derives its name mulonga from the Zambezi River. The name reflects the history and aspirations of the Tonga people. The name constantly revokes memories of how the Tonga were displaced to make way for the construction of the Kariba dam which has seen them becoming a marginalised group in Zimbabwe. Even well after their relocation the Tonga are being passed by huge commercial benefits from tourism and electricity that are being extracted from their former habitat which was transformed into a vast expanse of water known as the Kariba dam . The Tonga Online project seeks to establish and expand communication technology with and amongst the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi by joining them in with information communication technology. A number of school based information technology centres have been established in Binga district have been established in Binga district namely at Binga High School and at Manjolo and these have catered for the larger Tonga community with more schools being earmarked for the project<br/>Access to information has become a great question of political rights hence the importance of the Tonga Online project as a tool to spearhead awareness continuity empowerment and local development amongst the Tonga people. The educational significance of the Tonga online project is very significant especially for those in a remote part of the country like Binga where there are no institutions of higher learning<br/>The project also reflects the digital divide and other uneven developments; in the global village. These gaps and imbalances are not only a question of access to resources but also to have the capacity to use these modern day communication tools. In a world where access to information has become a universal human right the Tonga online project tends to support higher levels of human development<br/>The use of the global village has created a platform of for the Tonga to promote their culture through the internet. Currently the internet is one of the most convenient modes of communication and the Tonga Online project is a platform that can be used to give the Tonga a voice on the internet. It has been used as a platform by the Tonga to interact with other cultures hence it has been a medium of cultural exchange thus promoting the recognition of the Tonga<br/><br/>We Will Write a Custom Essay Specifically For You For Only $13.90/page! | Bl-irwol tal-midja li hija kruċjali<br/><br/>Bl-irwol tal-midja huwa kruċjali fil-promozzjoni tal-iżvilupp, it-Tonga fittxet ukoll li tnaqqas l-assenza tal-midja billi tistabbilixxi stazzjon tar-radju komunitarju. Fl-2007 huma stabbilew it-Tonga fuq l-ajru. Kien maħsub li l-Tonga ma kinitx irċeviet kopertura mill-midja tal-istat. It-twaqqif tal-istazzjon tar-radju kien pass biex jipprovdi lill-Tonga b'aċċess għall-informazzjoni u biex jagħti lil Tonga arti u espożizzjoni kulturali. Muduba tenfasizza s-sinifikat tal-istazzjon tar-radju billi tibbaża fuq il-fatt li l-Tonga ma kellhiex sinjal tar-radju jew tat-televiżjoni għas-snin u li l-istabbiliment ta' Tonga fuq l-ajru jagħti lill-komunità tal-BaTonga ċ-ċans li tkun infurmata kif ukoll iċ-ċans li tasal għall-popolazzjoni ġenerali.<br/>L-istabbiliment tar-radju f'Sazongwe kien megħjun minn tim ta' attivisti tar-radju Awstrijaċi kien primarjament immirat biex itejjeb il-komunikazzjoni u l-aċċess għall-informazzjoni fiż-żona remota marġinalizzati. L-istazzjon kien fi Skola Bażika u kellu l-kapaċità li jkopri raġġ ta' 20 kilometru li jilħaq bejn wieħed u ieħor 10000 persuna u kien maħsub biex iservi t-Tonga fuq iż-żewġ naħat taż-Żambja.<br/>Għal komunità marġinalizzati bħall-istazzjon tar-radju ta' Tonga tista' tintuża bħala mezz għall-artikolazzjoni u l-awtorappreżentanza li mhux biss tgħin fit-tisħiħ tal-kuxjenza, l-identità u l-kultura, iżda wkoll huwa apparat ta' komunikazzjoni li jikkontribwixxi għall-emanċipazzjoni u l-awtonomija ta' persuni f'reġjun iddominat minn kriżi politika u jagħti impuls għal taħdita pubblika ċara dwar il-kultura, is-soċjetà u l-politika. B'dan il-mod, stazzjon tar-radju komunitarju se jkun promoss b'mod wiesa' għax jiffaċilita l-parteċipazzjoni tal-midja ugwali hekk kif tkun miftuħa għal aktar demokratika u awto-organizzata peress li tkun miftuħa għall-komunità. It-Tonga dwar il-proġett tal-ajru iffaċilita wkoll is-sħubija mill-ġdid tal-familji li darba kienu separati mill-kostruzzjoni tad-dam Kariba. Stazzjon tar-radju komunitarju jinfluwenza wkoll il-bidla fil-politika tal-midja hekk kif jgħaddi. L-istazzjon tar-radju għen ukoll fil-pont tad-distakk fl-informazzjoni, u joffri wkoll programmi edukattivi f'Tonga u b'hekk huwa diffiċli ħafna għall-komunità mmirata<br/>Stabbiliment ta' Mużew Komunitarju<br/>Barra minn hekk, bħala mod kif tippromwovi u tiżviluppa l-lingwa u l-kultura ta' Tonga stabbilit ukoll mużew tal-komunità fiċ-ċentru Bingo.Il-mużew kellu rwol sinifikanti fir-rivitalizzazzjoni tal-lingwa u l-kultura ta' Tonga. BaTonga Museum (2012), il-mużew magħruf bħala BaTonga Museum ġie stabbilit fis-sena 2000 bl-għajnuna ta' sforz miftiehma bejn il-komunità ta' Tonga u MS Zimbabwe organizzazzjoni mhux governattiva Daniża. Kif enfasizzat hawn fuq fil-komunità mgħobbija b'isterjotipi u kunċetti żbaljati li wasslu għall-estinzjoni qarib tal-lingwa Tonga u l-kultura tal-mużew isservi bħala pjattaforma biex treġġa' lura l-istorja tal-Toonga permezz tad-diversi programmi li twettaq. BaTonga Museum (2002) L-għan ewlieni tal-mużew huwa li jeqred il-kultura ta' Tonga u joħloq sensibilizzazzjoni dwar il-kultura ta' Tonga lokalment, internazzjonalment u internazzjonalment. Hija tfittex ukoll li terġa' tibni l-istima tagħha stess u d-dinjità fost it-Tonga. Barra minn hekk, minbarra l-promozzjoni u l-preservazzjoni tal-lingwa u l-materjal kulturali ta' Tonga jaħdem ukoll b'appoġġ għall-għajxien tal-artisti billi jixtru oġġetti għall-wiri fil-gallerija. Peress li dawk il-kultura hija mwiegħda wkoll permezz ta' arti l-mużew kellu rwol sinifikanti ħafna f'dan ir-rigward. Il-mużew jospita wkoll għadd ta' avvenimenti kulturali li huma eBl-objettivi t'hawn fuq f'moħħ l-istabbiliment tal-Mużew ta' Batonga mill-komunità Tonga jista' jitqies bħala inizjattiva ta' żvilupp tajjeb peress li tgħin biex tippromwovi r-rikonoxximent tal-poplu ta' Tonga. Skont Chikozo il-kuratur tal-mużew, il-mużew għamel kontribut kbir lejn ir-restawr tad-drapp soċjali ta' Tonga. Hu jattribwixxi l-affermazzjoni tiegħu lir-rwol li kellu l-mużew fid-distrett ta' Bingham u fiż-Żimbabwe b'mod ġenerali. Il-mużew aġixxa bħala sors ta' informazzjoni kemm lejn it-Tonga kif ukoll lejn il-poplu ġenerali. Billi assuma r-responsabbiltà għax-xiri ta' materjal kulturali ta' Tonga il-mużew appoġġa kemm lill-għajxien ta' Tonga kif ukoll lill-promozzjoni u l-preservazzjoni tal-kultura ta' Tonga. Qabel it-Tonga artefatti kienu qed jinbiegħu fis-suq informali u esportati 'l barra mill-pajjiż bi spejjeż baxxi u kienu jinbiegħu bi prezzijiet kbar ħafna u f'xi każijiet jingħataw ismijiet aljeni li jfissru li l-Tonga kienet qiegħda tiġi sfruttata. Xenarju bħal dan ma jagħmilx ir-rwol tal-mużew fil-protezzjoni tal-materjal kulturali ta' Tonga huwa mod kif jippromwovi l-iżvilupp fost it-Tonga permezz tal-promozzjoni tal-kultura tagħhom. Il-mużew huwa wkoll ċentru tar-riżorsi bħala kull min jixtieq jitgħallem dwar il-kultura ta' Tonga huwa msemmi fih f'dak li għandu x'jaqsam mal-istorja u l-kultura ta' Tonga.<br/><br/>L-Introduzzjoni l-ICT fost l-Tonga<br/>It-Tonga permezz tal-għajnuna tad-donaturi għamlet ukoll sforzi biex tippromwovi l-aċċess għat-teknoloġija moderna billi tintroduċi l-ICT għall-komunità ta' Tonga. It-twaqqif tal-proġett ġie ffaċilitat mill-fiduċja tal-Kunzwana li ħadmet mal-assoċjazzjoni tal-ħbiberija taż-Żimbabwe Awstrijaka. Peress li t-tnedija tagħha l-proġett online ta' Tonga iffoka primarjament fuq il-promozzjoni ta' vuċi ta' Tonga fuq l-internet. L-objettivi tal-proġetti huma li jipprovdu l-aċċess ta' Tonga għad-dinja l-aktar għodod avvanzati ta' komunikazzjoni li jippermettulhom jirrappreżentaw lilhom infushom lejn id-dinja ta' barra u jirriflettu fuq l-ambjent soċjali, politiku u ekonomiku kemm tar-raħal globali li fih jgħixu l-Tonga.<br/>Il-proġett jikseb ismu munga mix-xmara Zammit. L-isem jirrifletti l-istorja u l-aspirazzjonijiet tan-nies ta' Tonga. L-isem kontinwament jirrevoka l-memorji ta' kif it-Tonga ġiet spostata biex issir il-kostruzzjoni tad-dam ta' Kariba li rahom isiru grupp marġinalizzati fiż-Żimbabwe. Anke wara r-rilokazzjoni tagħhom, it-Tonga qed tgħaddi minn benefiċċji kummerċjali enormi mit-turiżmu u l-elettriku li qed jiġu estratti mill-ħabitat preċedenti tagħhom li ġie trasformat f'espansjoni vasta ta' ilma magħruf bħala d-dam ta' Kariba. Il-proġett Tonga Online jfittex li jistabbilixxi u jespandi t-teknoloġija tal-komunikazzjoni ma' u fost l-Tonga fuq iż-żewġ naħat taż-Żambja billi jingħaqdu magħhom fit-teknoloġija tal-komunikazzjoni tal-informazzjoni. Ġew stabbiliti għadd ta' ċentri tat-teknoloġija tal-informazzjoni bbażati fuq l-iskola f'Binga, jiġifieri f'Binga High School u f'Manjiolo, u dawn inkitbu għall-komunità akbar ta' Tonga b'aktar skejjel allokati għall-proġett.<br/>L-aċċess għall-informazzjoni sar kwistjoni kbira ta' drittijiet politiċi b'hekk l-importanza tal-proġett online ta' Tonga bħala għodda li jxerred it-tisħiħ tal-kontinwità tal-għarfien u l-iżvilupp lokali fost in-nies ta' Tonga.

| Computer Networks – ARP<br/><br/>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure for mapping a dynamic Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a Media Access Control or MAC address.<br/><br/>The job of the ARP is essentially to translate 32-bit addresses to 48-bit addresses and vice-versa. This is necessary because in IP Version 4 (IPv4), the most common level of Internet Protocol (IP) in use today, an IP address is 32-bits long, but MAC addresses are 48-bits long.<br/><br/>ARP works between network layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). The MAC address exists on layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer, while the IP address exists on layer 3, the network layer.<br/><br/>ARP can also be used for IP over other LAN technologies, such as token ring, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and IP over ATM.<br/><br/>In IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses, ARP has been replaced by the Neighbor Discovery protocol.<br/><br/>How ARP works<br/><br/>When a new computer joins a LAN, it is assigned a unique IP address to use for identification and communication. When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular LAN arrives at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a MAC address that matches the IP address. A table called the ARP cache maintains a record of each IP address and its corresponding MAC address.<br/><br/>All operating systems in an IPv4 Ethernet network keep an ARP cache. Every time a host requests a MAC address in order to send a packet to another host in the LAN, it checks its ARP cache to see if the IP to MAC address translation already exists. If it does, then a new ARP request is unnecessary. If the translation does not already exist, then the request for network addresses is sent and ARP is performed.<br/><br/>ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines know they are using that particular IP address. When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.<br/><br/>Host machines that don't know their own IP address can use the Reverse ARP (RARP) protocol for discovery.<br/><br/>An ARP cache size is limited and is periodically cleansed of all entries to free up space; in fact, addresses tend to stay in the cache for only a few minutes. Frequent updates allow other devices in the network to see when a physical host changes their requested IP address. In the cleaning process, unused entries are deleted as well as any unsuccessful attempts to communicate with computers that are not currently powered on.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing and ARP cache poisoning<br/><br/>Any LAN that uses ARP must be wary of ARP spoofing, also referred to as ARP poison routing or ARP cache poisoning. ARP spoofing is a device attack in which a hacker broadcasts false ARP messages over a LAN in order to link an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server within the network. Once a link has been established, the target computer can send frames meant for the original destination to the hacker's computer first as well as any data meant for the legitimate IP address.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing can have serious impacts on enterprises. When used in their simplest form, ARP spoofing attacks can steal sensitive information. However, the attacks can also go beyond this and facilitate other malicious attacks, including: | Networks tal-kompjuter – ARP<br/><br/>Il-Protokoll ta' Riżoluzzjoni (ARPA) huwa proċedura għall-immappjar ta' indirizz dinamiku tal-Protokoll tal-Internet (IP address) lejn magna fiżika permanenti f'netwerk ta' żona lokali (LAN). L-indirizz tal-magna fiżika huwa magħruf ukoll bħala indirizz Media Access Control jew MAC.<br/><br/>Ix-xogħol tal-ARP huwa essenzjalment biex jittraduċi l-indirizzi 32-bit għal indirizzi ta' 48 bit u viċi versa. Dan huwa meħtieġ minħabba li fl-IP Version 4 (IPv4), l-aktar livell komuni ta' Protokoll tal-Internet (IP) fl-użu llum, indirizz IP huwa twil 32-bit, iżda l-indirizzi MAC huma 48-bits twal.<br/><br/>Xogħlijiet ta' l-ARP bejn is-saffi tan-netwerk 2 u 3 tal-mudell ta' l-Interkonnessjoni tas-Sistemi Miftuħa (OSI mudell). L-indirizz MAC jeżisti fuq is-saff 2 tal-mudell OSI, is-saff tal-link tad-data, waqt li l-indirizz IP jeżisti fuq is-saff 3, is-saff tan-netwerk.<br/><br/>ARP jistgħu jintużaw ukoll għall-IP fuq teknoloġiji oħra LAN, bħal ċirku token, interface ta' l-informazzjoni mqassma f'fibra (FDD) u IP fuq ATM.<br/><br/>F'IP6, li juża l-indirizzi ta' 128-bit, l-ARP ġie sostitwit mill-protokoll ta' iskoperta Neighbor.<br/><br/>Kif jaħdem l-APP<br/><br/>Meta kompjuter ġdid jissieħeb ma' LAN, jiġi assenjat indirizz IP uniku għall-użu għall-identifikazzjoni u l-komunikazzjoni. Meta pakkett li jasal għal magna ospitanti fuq LAN partikolari jasal f'portal, il-portal jitlob il-programm ARP biex isib indirizz MAC li jaqbel mal-indirizz IP. Tabella msejħa l-cache tal-ARPA iżżomm rekord ta' kull indirizz IP u l-indirizz MAC korrispondenti tiegħu.<br/><br/>Is-sistemi operattivi kollha f'netwerk ta' Ethernet IPv4 iżommu l-cache tal-ARP. Kull darba li l-ospitanti jitlob indirizz MAC biex jibgħat pakkett lill-ospitanti oħra fil-LAN, tivverifika l-cache tal-ARPA tiegħu biex tara jekk l-IP biex tindirizza t-traduzzjoni diġà jeżistix. Jekk tagħmel dan, allura m'hemmx bżonn ta' talba ġdida għall-ARPA. Jekk it-traduzzjoni ma tkunx diġà teżisti, it-talba għall-indirizzi tan-netwerk tintbagħat u l-ARP titwettaq.<br/><br/>L-ARP ixandar pakkett ta' talba għall-magni kollha fuq il-LAN u jitlob jekk xi waħda mill-magni tkun taf li qed tuża dak l-indirizz tal-IP partikolari. Meta magna tirrikonoxxi l-indirizz IP bħala tagħha stess, tibgħat tweġiba sabiex ARP ikun jista' jaġġorna l-cache għal referenza futura u jipproċedi bil-komunikazzjoni.<br/><br/>Il-magni ospitanti li ma jafux l-indirizz IP tagħhom stess jistgħu jużaw il-protokoll ta' Reverse ARP (RAP) għall-iskoperta.<br/><br/>Daqs tal-cache tal-RP hija limitata u perjodikament huwa mnaddaf mill-entrati kollha għall-ispazju ħieles; fil-fatt, l-indirizzi għandhom it-tendenza li jibqgħu fil-cache għal ftit minuti biss. L-aġġornamenti frekwenti jippermettu mezzi oħra fin-netwerk jaraw meta host fiżiku jibdel l-indirizz IP mitlub tagħhom. Fil-proċess tat-tindif, l-entrati mhux użati jitħassru kif ukoll kwalunkwe tentattiv ta' suċċess biex jikkomunikaw mal-kompjuters li bħalissa mhumiex imħaddma.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing u ARP cache ippożizzjonar<br/><br/>Kwalunkwe LAN li juża l-RPP għandu jkun mod ta' l-ispoofing ARP, imsejjaħ ukoll bħala r-rotta tal-pożizzjoni ta' l-ARP jew l-ippożizzjonar tal-cache tal-RP. L-ispoofing tal-ARP huwa attakk tal-apparat li fih xandar ta' hacker falza messaġġi ARP fuq LAN sabiex jgħaqqad l-indirizz MAC tal-attakkant mal-indirizz IP ta' kompjuter jew server leġittimu fi ħdan in-netwerk. Ladarba tkun ġiet stabbilita link, il-kompjuter fil-mira jista' jibgħat frejms maħsuba għad-destinazzjoni oriġinali lill-kompjuter tal-hacker l-ewwel kif ukoll kwalunkwe data maħsuba għall-indirizz IP leġittimu.<br/><br/>L-ispoofing tal-ARP jista' jkollu impatti serji fuq l-intrapriżi.Meta jintużaw fil-forma sempliċi tagħhom, l-attakki kontra l-isfruttar tal-ARP jistgħu jisirqu informazzjoni sensittiva. Madankollu, l-attakki jistgħu wkoll imorru lil hinn minn dan u jiffaċilitaw attakki malizzjużi oħra, inklużi: |
