| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 ta' Novembru 2015<br/>mibgħut minn Doxoderol<br/><br/>Bacopa huwa impjant perenni li tiffjorixxi f'reġjuni subtropikali u tropikali marh madwar id-dinja. Il-ħwawar meqjusa ħafna huwa ingredjent ewlieni fl-Doxidol, Suppliment nutrizzjonali li jtejjeb il-funzjoni konjittiva. Bacopa kienet magħżula għall-abbiltà tagħha li tipproteġi l-moħħ u żżid acetylcholine, a messaġġiera biokimiċi li jippermetti li s-sistema nervuża biex relay informazzjoni.<br/><br/>Il-prattikanti ayurvedic ewwel ddeskrivew il-proprjetajiet terapewtiċi tal-bacapa f'300 QK. It-tobba rreġistraw l-abbiltajiet tal-bacopa biex itejbu l-intelliġenza u l-memorja. Kważi 2,500 sena wara, korp dejjem jikber ta' riċerka moderna tikkonferma l-benefiċċji konjittivi ta' bacopa rreġistrati fit-test Ayrvedic.<br/><br/>Fl‐1987, ir‐riċerkaturi fl‐Indja evalwaw l‐effetti tal‐kamp ta' applikazzjoni fuq il‐funzjoni intellettwali tat‐tfal li għandhom età żgħira. Matul l‐istudju ta' erba' ġimgħat, huma amministraw bacapa għal 40 tifel u tifla li kienu 6 sa 8 snin. Ix-xjentisti ddeterminaw li l-kamp ta' applikazzjoni żdied il-perċezzjoni u l-memorja. It-tfal kienu kapaċi jsolvu l-eżerċizzji ta' labirinti aktar malajr u b'mod aktar preċiż wara li rċevew il-bacopa. Ħafna ġenituri fl-Indja jużaw baka biex itejbu l-iżvilupp intellettwali tat-tfal tagħhom.<br/><br/>Studju ta' 12-il ġimgħa ippubblikat fil-ħarġa ta' Awwissu 2001 ta' Psikoloġija investiga l-effetti tal-kamp ta' applikazzjoni fuq il-funzjoni konjittiva. Ix-xjentisti assenjaw b'mod aleatorju lill-voluntiera b'saħħithom, li għandhom 18-il sena sa 65 sena, biex jirċievu l-bakapa jew sustanza inattiva. Huma użaw ukoll konfigurazzjoni doppja-għomja għall-istudju biex jaħbu l-identitajiet tal-prodotti.

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Kien il-ħoss ta' memorja mill-bogħod, vuċi li bdiet tinsa iżda ddisprata għall-istess. Kienet il-vuċi ta' ommha, mibruma f'serra ta' bintha. Waral, Kagome abbanduna mingħajr traċċajt. Qalu b'mod ċar dawk il-mumenti, il-mod kif bdiet il-ġurnata, dak li kellha għall-kolazzjon u l-aħħar ħaġa li kienet qalet lil ommha. Kien ta' qerq, dawn il-memorji, għaliex kienet simili għal kull darba oħra li kienet tiżżewġet bejn dinjiet. Hija kienet ħadmet, inqas, għaliex ma kellha l-ebda skop barra mill-iskola. Hi setgħet issib xogħol, u kienet skedata għal intervista dik il-ġurnata. Qalbha ma kinitx fiha, iżda kienet dak li kienet meħtieġa biex tagħmel.<br/><br/>Hija fakkret is-sentiment tal-mejtin, billi tat isimha u tat taħdita fuq il-qoxra li setgħet tagħmel dan. Li setgħet tagħmel progress fil-ħajja li kienet maħsuba biex issa li l-affarijiet kienu ġew solvuti fil-passat. M'għandniex xi ngħidu, hi kellha l-ħlejjaq li tħoss li hi m'għadhiex tappartjeni għall-ħin tagħha stess jew għall-ħajja tagħha stess.<br/><br/>Kagsome fakkret is-sentiment tal-injam taħt is-swaba'tagħha, il-mod kif l-id tagħha kienet imċajpra fil-manku biex jiżżerżaq l-bieb miftuħ. Hija fakkret li hi maqfula, dawwarha ommha b'smile qawwija u vibranti bħala hi xogħlu ruħha mill-sostenitur tagħha. "Jien qed jittieħed off." Hija tfakkar kif qawwija tagħha vuċi soda, l-smile fuq ix-xufftejn omm tagħha kif għajnejha shone mal-kburija. Ommha faċċata tagħha, li ma kien jidher l-ebda differenti minn qabel iżda b'xi mod il-piż tal-kliem li kien hemm fis-sema fuq l-ispallejn tal-Kagomew aktar hi riflessa.<br/><br/>Fil-qosor, il-ħsibijiet li kien hemm wara, tistaqsi jekk ommha qabżetx magħha.Kagome setgħetx b'mod miftuħ tammetti li s-saħħa ta' ommha, l-appoġġ tagħha għall-fatt li t-tifla tagħha żkeċċiet matul iż-żmien tant spiss. Kien hemm żminijiet meta hi ħasbu stess dgħajfa għal ma jkollhomx il-mara li dgħif fuq.<br/><br/>Madankollu, hija fakkret li hija għamlet lill-kaptan ammont ta' saħħa mill-aqwa. Hija setgħet tiftakar il-bidla fl-arja, it-temperatura partikolarment differenti minn dik li kienet mistennija, billi torbot fil-madwar f'daqqa u mhux familjari. Ma kienx is-santwarju tal-familja tagħha. U meta daret biex tmur lura, biex tiżloq permezz tal-bieb li kienet ħarġet, kienet tiltaqa' ma' metall mhux familjari u kiesaħ taħt is-swaba' tagħha u ġewwa li ma kienx id-daħla tad-dar tagħha. Raġel kien qabel tagħha, wara counter, li beda fl-għajnejn tagħha bħala wiesgħa kif tagħha stess.<br/><br/>Hija ma kinitx paniku, tal-anqas. Qed tgħaddi minn żmien u titqiegħed f'sitwazzjonijiet impossibbli mill-inqas mibnija rieda tiegħek sa fejn kien hemm nuqqas ta' qbil. Għax ma kienx kuljum li xi ħadd sabu lilhom infushom maqtula fil-passat b'demon, intenzjoni li ttaffi ġojjell qawwi mill-ġisem tagħhom li lanqas ma kienu jafu kien hemm. U mbagħad kien hemm il-fatt li hi kienet tgħammix qal jewel qawwija li jaf kemm biċċiet u kien imqabbad biex isibu lilhom., ħwejjeġ bħal dawn ma kinux normali, u kellha bżonn biex quare up u roll magħha ladarba hi realizzati li kienet realtà tagħha. Kien deher hekk sempliċi, biss jiġbru l-shards u jiffissaw il-ġojjell.<br/><br/>Imma ma kienx faċli, kien hemm ħafna demos wara l-hards u l-ġojjell innifsu.U wieħed partikolarment qawwi juru li kien determinat li jarah. Għal dan il-jum, qatt ma tgħallmu x-xewqa tiegħu, imma qatt ma kien ingħata darba li kellu l-ħaġa mfaħħlin. Huwa kien baqagħlu tant ħajjiet għal din il-biċċa l-kbira. Naraku kien l-iktar ħaġa diffiċli, u dak li kien iċ-ċentru ta' dak kollu li kien żbaljat fil-ħajja kollha ta' ħabiba tagħha.<br/><br/>Iżda din il-prevedibilità, li n-neċessità ta' qlib ta' dak li kien qed jiġri u r-rieda li hija kienet kisbet mill-avventura tagħha li hija reġgħet naqset milli toħroġ bi storja li kienet toqgħod fil-mument li ma kienx jidher wisq whimsical jew fared. Hija meħtieġa li tkun temmen, hi meħtieġa biex tibqa' tgħix.<br/><br/>Wara kollox, hi ffaċċjat mill-bniedem f'ħanut tal-kamera. Hija kienet għexet permezz tas-snien tagħha biex isalva l-ħajja tagħha qabel.<br/><br/>Fl-aħħar mill-aħħar, ma kienx hemm dar sħiħa. Wara kollox, hija kienet bdiet id-dar tagħha bl-intenzjoni li tattendi intervista għax-xogħol. L-istat ta' l-ilbies tagħha kien tal-inqas attestat ma' dak kollu li kieku kienet waħda mill-fibs aktar faċli li qatt qalt.<br/><br/>U, għal xi raġuni, li crazy-bniedem impjegat tagħha.<br/><br/>かぁ�め<br/><br/>Kagomed irrumblat fuq fis-sodda tagħha bħala hi mbuttat lura l-memorji 'l bogħod, li jirrifjutaw li jirrikonoxxu li kienet verament imqajjem. Hija kuntenta fl-aħħar gideb ta 'irqad, begging li jirritornaw u jieħdu lura fil -post tagħha. Hija għalqet l-għajnejn tagħha, lesti għall-irqad u kienet biss iltaqa' ma' memorji.L-ekes ta' kanzunetta sang fid-distanza tal-memorji tagħha, kanzunetta li ħafna drabi kellha tormedha, minħabba l-istess isem bħal tagħha. Il-vuċi li s-sang m'għadhiex reminis mill-omm tagħha, iżda l-vuċijiet tat-tfal li hija kienet ħafna drabi kellha ma' tkabbir up. Huma appellaw lura l-memorji, minkejja li kienu snin minn mindu bdiet din il-ħajja, minkejja li kienet kuntenta f'dan il-ħajja, is-sejħa ta' dawn il-memorji kienet kbira wisq.<br/><br/>F'daqqa waħda, hija kienet taqa' lura fihom u l-irqad evitat lilha mill-ġdid.Hija kienet tara ruħha fl-imbruxija tal-familja tagħha filwaqt li Inuyasha kienet impinġija lura lejn il-bir, filwaqt li kienet qed tfittex kif kienet bdiet tħossha. Il-memorji ta' dak il-mument, dawk is-sentimenti, kienu daqshekk b'saħħithom. Is-sentimenti ta' tkissir tal-qalb u ta' dwejjaq kbar reġgħu ppermettilu ħafna żmien peress li ħassu qisu li kien ipprittu minn dak kollu li kien stqarrilha.<br/><br/>M'għandniex xi ngħidu, il-familja tagħha kienet kuntenta li tkun fl-armi tagħhom għal darb'oħra. Hija qatt ma setgħet għal kollox tiddeskrivi kif kienet ħasset f'dawk il-jiem. Hija xorta ma setgħux jispjegaw il-mod kif ħassu maqsuma f'żewġ, b'xewqat tal-biża 'li tkun kemm fil-passat kif ukoll fil-preżent. Hi fakkret l-attentati ta' futli biex tiżdied il-bir, is-swaba' jimxu fl-art bi pjaċir iddisprata biex iħallu r-ritorn tagħha. L-ewwel xahar dar, hi ma irqad tant kif hi cried.<br/><br/>Elysion kienet mogħtija reazzjoni simili, għalkemm ma kienx daqshekk ħarxa minħabba li ma kinitx taf eżattament fejn hi kienet tiżloq permezz u lanqas ma kienet taf fejn kienet tista'twim mod tagħha lura. L-esplorazzjonijiet tagħha kienu sottili bejn ix-xogħol tagħha u jippruvaw isolvu lilha nfisha f'din il-ħajja. Ma kellha l-ebda intenzjoni li toqgħod aktar milli kellha bżonn. U filwaqt li hi ma kinitx tipprova bħala b'qalb tajba hekk kif hi kellha meta ppruvaw jirritornaw lejn l-imgħoddi, il-passjoni tagħha ġiet għax ma kellha l-ebda rabtiet ma' din id-dinja. Minħabba li hi kienet verament waħedha... Bl-ebda tama ta' ħadd li laħaqha.<br/><br/>Fil-mumenti irrazzjonali tagħha, hi ħasbu li l-Jewel kien wiegħed tagħha lura u sab infern ġdid biex jgħix fiha., infern ġdid li kellu l-forza biex jagħmel ix-xewqa tagħha, imma hi fakkret b'mod ċar li kienet xtaqet tmur għal dejjem. Li ma tieqaf ħolm tagħha, il-ħinijiet meta hi woke up fil-tagħbija bil-lejl.U dawk il-memorji tal-passat tagħha kienu l-aktar diffiċli biex jittrattaw, l-aktar diffiċli biex tinsa. Qalbha bdiet razza fi paniku kif hi daru fis-sodda tagħha mill-ġdid, tan-nifs tagħha saret ġlieda kontra attakk tal-paniku kkawżat mill-moħħ wandering tagħha dan tard fil-lejl.<br/><br/>Hija hateed tħossok hekk dgħajfa, hekk jibżgħu.<br/><br/>砠の中®鳥ワ<br/><br/>Kagsome fl-aħħarnett miġbud stess mis-sodda, il-kamra tagħha mixgħula b'dawl pallida li kien biżżejjed biex tiggwidaha fil-kamra tal-banju. Hija kienet qabel il-mera, il-sink jaħdem filwaqt li bdiet fir-riflessjoni tagħha. Raven kulur tax-xagħar koperti wiċċ tagħha u hi ħassew bħala ħażina kif hi ħares. L-ewwel filgħodu tagħha fl-Elysion kien simili għal dan, biss hi kienet fil-forma agħar.<br/><br/>Hija kienet sabet post biex torqod, u b'hekk mexxiet ftehim mas-sid tal-bini biex tkun tista' tibqa' perjodu żgħir ta' żmien mingħajr ma tħallas. Forsi kien l-influwenza ta' Miroku li tatha biex issib dak il-ftehim, hekk kif il-monk kien magħruf għall-mod tiegħu f'nies charming (jew scaming) biex jagħtihom aktar minn biżżejjed għax-xogħol li kienu għamlu. Il-monk kien dejjem dak il-mod, peress li kien l-ewwel iltaqa'. Huwa kien se jitlob lill-abitazzjoni ta' sid il-kera biex jiġi eżawrit meta ma kienx jew, jekk jitlob li din kienet soġġetta għal attakk meta ma kinitx tkun qed tinbiegħ il-premjijiet u l-karkki tiegħu għal dawn il-prezzijiet għoljin. Huwa ħadem prattikament kull darba u wissa għala n-nies kienu tant lesti li jafdawh.<br/><br/>Forsi kien daħka tiegħu, jew il-fatt li kien monk li n-nies tal-passat kienu tant lesti li jaħbtu. Hu qatt ma kien ipprefera fuq id-dgħjufija, għall-inqas. Hu dejjem għamel dak li kien tajjeb u kien simbolu ta' saħħa fi żminijiet meta kellu timbotta permezz ta' kollox sabiex jagħmel dak li kien tajjeb. Hu ħeġġeġ permezz tal-fatt li kien qed imut, li ġie mġiegħel jagħmel xi ħaġa dwaru aktar milli kien iħobb id-destin tiegħu. Huwa kien imbuttat lilu nnifsu lejn il-limitu ta' żmien li wassal għall-ġlieda finali tagħhom. U hi kienet kuntenta li kienu megħluba Naraku qabel ma seta' jsir soġġett għall-istess destin bħal missieru, u missieru qabelu.<br/><br/>Madankollu, sa fejn sħabha stess marru, hija kienet aktar ġusta minn ħabib tagħha u għamlet il-ftehim raġonevoli. Hija ddubitat li xi ħadd f'din id-dinja kellu jħallas prezz hefty għall-eskoriżmu jew għall-projbizzjoni tad-dimostrazzjonijiet. Iżda hija kienet għaqlija biżżejjed, u intelliġenti biżżejjed, li jagħmlu ftehim tajjeb.<br/><br/>Iżda issa, Kagme kien f'post aħjar għalkemm id-dehra fuq tagħha fil-wiċċ ħares lejn l-istess. Haunted, għajjien, imnixxfa...<br/><br/>Ħarsa malajr lejn l-arloġġ fuq il-ħajt qalha li hi tista tipprova torqod itwal. Imma hi magħżula minn dan, li ma jridux jiffaċċjaw il-flashbacks mill-ġdid. Hija ħadet doċċa minflok, bl-użu ta' l-ilma kiesaħ biex chase bogħod tagħha demons, biex jimla l-pulmuni tagħha b'teħid jaqtgħu tad- nifs u l-forza nnifisha awake.<br/><br/>������������������チチチネbjani<br/><br/>Ma kienx qed jaħdem.<br/><br/>Mhux fil-mod li kienet tixtieq.L-ilma kiesaħ ċertament sfurzata l-arja fil-pulmun tagħha, sfurzati moħħok li wakes u muskoli biex jaħtfu.Taħx ġie jinġibed mill-xufftejn tagħha kif hi tmejjel kap tagħha lura u sab ruħu tiftakar aktar. Illum, hi ma kienx se jaħrab minnhom b'tali mod faċli. Hija ma kinitx se tirkupra hekk sempliċiment, biex jirkupraw biss minħabba li hija lesta.<br/><br/>Xi kultant, m'hemm l-ebda jevitaw il-ħsibijiet li inti riedu., Anke meta inti kienu ċerti li inti kienu fil-passat tagħhom.<br/><br/>Sango kien ikun ta' għajnuna kbira f'din is-sitwazzjoni. Is-saff tad-dimostrazzjoni kien ħabiba tagħha l-aqwa, saħansitra kien imur sa fejn is-seħer tagħha li qatt ma kellu. oħt akbar li kien għaqli, dejjem kellu n-naħa tagħha meta kien hemm problemi. B'mod partikolari boy problemi, meta dawn l-affarijiet kienu pjuttost trivjali iżda kien divertenti li jkollhom tfarrak u għall-ħabib tagħha li ssir f'isimha meta Inuyasha għamlet ir-ramel tagħha. Wara kollox, kien ta' spiss li l-half-demon kien jaħdem man-naħa tal-maħbuba mejta tiegħu u jkisser il-qalb tagħha aktar minn darba.<br/><br/>Iżda, Sango ispiratha wkoll b'modi oħra. Wara li l-mara kollha kienet qed tħabbat wiċċha magħha, dejjem kienet tant b'saħħitha, u għalhekk żgur... Anke fil-ħinijiet li kienet dubjuża lejh, hi dejjem miġbuda permezz tagħha. Hija ammirat li kellha l-abbiltà li tgħix wara li titlef il-familja kollha tagħha - il- tfakkira ta' dan ħafna drabi mbuttat Kagme biex jgħixu, minħabba li tilfet kulħadd f'din id-dinja - u mbagħad wara li ħuh isir pawn ta' Narku. Ma kienx faċli, ma setgħetx kienet xi ħaġa għal dik xi ħadd biss tista' tiffaċċja u għadha tmur 'l quddiem b'dak l-uġigħ u dawk il-tfakkiriet... Ta' spiss kien daqshekk qawwi, anke fil-ħinijiet aktar skuri.<br/><br/>U d-dritt issa, hi riedu li jitgħallmu fin-naħa ta' fuq tal-mara, jieħdu l-kumdità fil-fatt li kienet hemm u hija kienet ta' appoġġ. Hija ħasset li Sango b'xi mod tiġbed permezz ta' dan, u toffri xi kliem ta' saħħa u fehim. Kien wasal iż-żmien bħal dawn li għamlu dawn il-perjodi agħar, il-fiduċja kostanti li kienet mingħajr il-familja tagħha.<br/><br/>"Ma rridx li tkun waħdu." Hija criedi b'leħen għoli fis-solitudni tagħha, il-ħoss tax-xawer naqqas il-motiv.<br/><br/>Hija ma kinitx jibżgħu li jammettu.<br/><br/>掎�££®��?«<br/><br/>Siegħa oħra kienet tiżloq minn qabel ma kienet realizzata.Il-ġilda tagħha kienet kiesħa mill-ilma u ħassetha bħal borra permezz tal-vini tagħha. Hija ma rrealizzatx li bdiet tiżbalja sakemm kellha l-idejn tagħha biex titfi l-ilma u tispiċċa d-doċċa tagħha. Kagsome ma tfittixha stess fil-mera mill-ġdid, minflok, hi mgeżwra ruħha fil-xugamani u mdawwla mill-kamra tal-banju, sa l-taraġ u fis-kċina tagħha. Hija bdiet tagħmel kolazzjon ħafif, idealment qari permezz ta' noti tagħha għall-jum bħala l-ikel imsajjar.<br/><br/>Il-karriera tagħha kienet verament qed tieħu dawn l-aħħar snin. Ir-ritratti tagħha dehru f'ħafna galleriji, isimha beda spiss ħafna x-xufftejn għal dawk li kienu interessati fil-fotografija.<br/><br/>L-impjieg li kienet talbet għal min kien raha kollha. Hija kienet ferm aktar xxurtjati milli kienet mistennija li tkun f'din id-dinja. Qatt ma xxurtjati biżżejjed biex tiżloq lura permezz tal-xquq fid-dinja tagħha stess, iżda xxurtjati biżżejjed biex tagħmel tajjeb. Peress li marret lura għall-istokk, hija fakkret il-ħin li fl-aħħar kienet ingħatat f'dar ta' ritorn. Kien hemm madwar sentejn fil-ħajja tagħha hawn, kif bdiet tieħu sehem fil-fotografija bħala aktar minn sempliċiment passatemp iżda xi ħaġa li tista' tagħmel isem għaliha nnifisha.<br/><br/>Dak il-jum kien partikolarment pjaċevoli, ix-xemx kienet għolja fl-ajru u kienet sabet ruħha li tieħu xi ritratti tax-xenarju naturali. Ftit boy kien moħbija f'wieħed mill-pjanti, u hi kienet maqbuda stampa tal-mument wiċċ tiegħu kien ssaldat f'moħħ isbaħ, ħabba ħażin il-mument qabel ma kien jaqbeż biex jibda priża tiegħu. Hija fakkretha f'Sippu, il-kittijiet ftit li hija kienet, essenzjalment, adottat. Huwa, wisq, ttulet mill-familja tiegħu meta kienu ltaqgħu għall-ewwel darba. Missieru kien qed jinqatlu u kien determinat li jpattulu. Waqt li ż-żgħażagħ, kien jidher hekk maturi fl-ewwel laqgħa tagħhom.<br/><br/>Forsi kien l-influwenza ta' Inuyasha li ppermettiet li l-kitt jaġixxi bħal tifel mill-ġdid, biex ikun żgħażagħ u whimsical fi żminijiet filwaqt li oħrajn kien aktar maturi. Hu offra l-kumdità tiegħu fi triqittu, u pprova jieħu ħsieb lilu kif kienet kienet hi stess għalkemm kienet tant żagħżugħa wkoll. Madankollu, iż-żgħażagħ tagħha ma żammewx lura milli jifhmu kif għandu x'jaqsam maʼ tifel jew tiflaha. Qalbu biegħha meta tbissima, meta kien hekk kuntenta li kien ir-rigal tiegħu tal-karrenji u ħa ż-żmien biex jagħmel l-arti. Hija tant kienet kburi b'kull tpinġija li kienet taf li dan kien kif omm kienet tħoss f'sitwazzjoni bħal din.<br/><br/>L-uġigħ li kellu ripped permezz tagħha kien wisq, wisq f'daqqa. Hija ma rnexxietxielhiex u xtaq tara kemm kienet imkabbra minħabba li kienet marret. Hija kienet mitlufa tant...<br/><br/>Biex jifred ruħha b'uġigħ ieħor, kull tama falza... Hija tat up.U ffukata fuq l-imħatri nnifisha.<br/><br/>鶴�二<br/><br/>Il-kolazzjon b'togħma ta' l-art, titqib, u ispirat. Biss wara li hi kienet spiċċat hi kienet minsija għal kull xorta ta' ħwawar jew flavor ma' l-ikel. Kien tard wisq biex tiftakar li ħafna, kif moħħha kien wisq okkupat tiftakar dettalji oħra tal-ħajja tagħha li b'mod ċar saret aktar importanti mill-ikel tagħha.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>M'għandniex xi ngħidu, xejn ma ġara meta kellha b'ħeġġa minn klijent partikolarment frustranti li fakkarha bin-nofs tad-demon. Huwa kien partikolarment strambi u rude, u ma kienx qed jgħid ritratt tiegħu minflok kiri tiegħu joħroġ b'mod naturali. Tista' tipprova ġġiegħel lill-annimali selvaġġi jaġixxu kif ridt. Iżda, rari ħadd ma rnexxielu jisfurza. Inuyasha ma kienx daqshekk ħażin. Inuyasha kienet tgħallem qabel ma kienet ġiet sfurzata minnha. Huwa kien sar ġentili, aktar jifhmu, aktar maturi għalkemm kien hemm drabi li kien għadu tifel u cocky.<br/><br/>Hija tiftakar kif kienu ġrew cheeks tagħha, iżda kif kienet l-art tagħha u fired lilu. Qaltlu hi rrifjutat li taħdem għal xi ħadd jew ma' xi ħadd li riedu jduru xi ħaġa lil hinn min-natura tagħha, lil hinn mix-xewqat tagħha stess.<br/><br/>Hi kellha tqabbel ir-raġel ma' Naraku aktar milli Inuyasha. Għalkemm il-klijent tagħha ma kellux dawn l-intenzjonijiet estremi. Tal-anqas wara s-sentiment kien memorja pjaċevoli. Il-libertà li tkun taf li hi kienet s'issa li setgħet tirrifjuta x-xogħol li ma tixtieqx tagħmel, li tkun persuna tagħha stess li kienet indipendenti minn oħrajn. Hija setgħet tgħid li kienet f'dak il-punt. Anke jekk hi mismugħa jum wara b'kliem fisser li slander tagħha.<br/><br/>Hija ddefendiet ruħha b'ġustizzja, bħal hi għamlet lejn l-aħħar tal-vjaġġ tagħha. Wara kollox, kienet l-unika waħda li setgħet tipproteġi ruħha f'din id-dinja.<br/><br/>滑っダミ<br/><br/>Għal darb'oħra bdiet titkeċċi f'darha, u fakkretha mill-ġdid dwar il-passaġġ taż-żmien. Għal darb'oħra, hija qieset il-lista tal-affarijiet li kellha tagħmel u ddubitat dwar fejn tista' tibda. Jew, jekk kellha saħansitra tibda. B'kif beda l-jum, hi ma kinitx taf jekk hi setgħetx tikkunsidra li idea kbira. Kien dubju li kienet se tirnexxi b'liema mitlufa fiha nfisha saret.<br/><br/>Ma riedx li mess sa l-aħħar xogħol tagħha. Minħabba li hi kienet għamlet li f'xi okkażjonijiet qabel. Ma kienx pjaċevoli li tipprova u tirkupra minn diżastru komplut.<br/><br/>Kagsome fakkret is-sentiment tagħha għalja, il-marka ġdida, il-kamera tiżolqa mill-idejn tagħha. Hija ma kinitx ippreparata biex tappoġġjaha, għaliex kienet għadha kemm neħħiha mill-borża tagħha. Meta kienet qed titħabat permezz ta' skola tan-nofs, fuq in-naħa ta' fuq, b'mod sħiħ fuq il-pjaga li kienet ta' spiss għamlet meta kienet qed titħabat magħha. Il-parti l-oħra tal-tagħha kienet baqgħet ffriżata f'postha filwaqt li l-lenti tagħha kkastjata kompletament u l-bqija tal-kamera kienet maqsuma flimkien magħha.<br/><br/>Ara l-aħwa ta' Inuyasha, dimostrazzjoni sħiħa, qabel ma kienet l-aħħar ħaġa mistennija meta kienet għamlet mod tagħha għar-ritratti tagħha. Qatt kien kburi bħal qatt qabel, kif imponietha hekk kif tfakkar. M'għandniex xi ngħidu, biex tkun f'dinja kollha differenti, għalkemm qatt ma kienet l-aħjar fil-qari ta' moħħu tiegħu. L-isem tiegħu fuq ix-xufftejn tagħha kien tant potenti, li setgħet tiftakar is-sentimenti tal-aqwa kif għamlet. Ix-xofftejn tagħha kienu mqattgħin, tagħha fil-ħalq ħassew niexfa, u l-bużżieqa tħossok ansjetà fl-istonku tagħha magħmula morda tħossok tagħha.<br/><br/>Hija ma ridtx it-tamiet tagħha li tkun up.<br/><br/>Iżda, xtaqet li jkun hemm, anke jekk ma kinux ħbieb. Huma kienu alles, jekk xejn, peress li kienu ġġieldu ħdejn xulxin. U xi ħaġa kienet aħjar minn xejn assolutament.<br/><br/>U Kagsome kellu s-sens biżżejjed biex ma tarmi lilu nnifsu, biex iweġġgħu l-armi tagħha madwar lilu fil-ħelsien li jafu li ma kienx waħdu. kamera tagħha ma baqgħetx kwistjoni meta hi avviċinat lilu. Hija tfakkar li xejn aktar ma kien meqjus għal jiem bħala hi qatta' l-ħin miegħu, mhux qed jitkellem dwar id-dinja tagħhom iżda kien qed jitkellem (jew, hi kienet sempliċement rikonoxxuta dak il-fatt).<br/><br/>Meta, eżattament, hija waqgħet għalih għalkemm... Kagme ma setgħetx tfakkar. Kienet ħaġa sottili, bħalma kien hemm.Iżda kienet taf li kienet taf li hi ma kinitx waħedha fil-fatt li kienet waqgħet, li s-sentimenti kienu b'xi mod imdejjaq.<br/><br/>Pajjiż Reġjun Kodiċi: ́R®����m<br/><br/>A sensazzjoni ta' użin overtok tagħha u f'daqqa għajnejn tagħha fetħet filwaqt li moħħok b'mod ddisprata għall-aħħar ħaġa li kienet qed tagħmel. Hija ma ħaditx passi fuq couch tagħha, iżda hi kienet taf l-aħħar post li kienet kienet fuq il-kuxxini wisq komda., Madankollu, ma kontx, jew il-ġlieda kontra l-piż kif kienet fl-armi familjari. Ir-ras tagħha tmejjel kontra s-sider ta' Sodomaru, filwaqt li ħadet il-kumdità fil-fatt li kien hawn u ma kienx waħdu.<br/><br/>Merħba lura."It-tweġiba tiegħu kienet ta' fama ħażina fir-rikonoxximent. Ma kellux bżonn jitkellem ħafna għaliha biex jifhem l-intenzjoni tiegħu, jew il-bqija ta' dak li kellu jgħid.<br/><br/>Huwa kien iġorrha lura fis-sodda, u kien joqgħodha f'postu b'faċilità. L-għajnejn tagħha kienu sodisfatti u mxerred faċilment għax ma kien hemm l-ebda memorji iktar iffredi lura, fejn qatt ma kien qrib, ma waqgħet lura f'dawk il-ħsibijiet. Huwa kien għen, u s-snin kienu għenu. Illum kien biss... Waħda minn dawk il-jiem.<br/><br/>Hu kkmanda b'faċilità, l-għajnejn tiegħu irrumblat fuqu iżda ma ġegħilx għaliex kienet għajjiena. Id-dejjaqha bil-kbir, filwaqt li ħassu kontra l-istampa tagħha kontra l-idejn fil-valutazzjoni tal-benessri tagħha.<br/><br/>"Jien okay," hi qalet, kliem tagħha sod mal-wegħda tagħha.<br/><br/>Hija kienet okay. Hija kienet ħajja. U kienet kuntenta.<br/><br/>だ����れ<br/><br/>bejjiegħ bl-ingrossa tal-prodotti tal-injam<br/><br/>sommarju<br/><br/>Kagame, f'punt wieħed fil-ħajja tagħha, kien tifla pjuttost regolari ta' adoloxxenti sakemm kienet attakkat minn demonja ġewwa dar tajba tal-familja tagħha, u d-dimostrazzjoni xxejjen tagħha fil-bir, li b'mod maġiku ġabethiex madwar 500 sena fil-passat. Hemm, hija tgħallmu li ġojjell sagri kien magħluq ġewwa l-ġisem tagħha peress li kienet ir-reinkarnazzjoni ta' qassis li kien miet 50 sena qabel iż-żmien li kienet imħattba fih. Il-ġojjell ġie ripped mill-ġisem tal-mara u d-dimostrazzjoni li dgħajfet il-ħin tagħha ġiet megħluba mill-half-demon li hi freened li kien irrenjat mas-siġra. Kaghame benx il-half-demon, Inuyasha, fil-ħin u ivvjaġġa miegħu biex jirrestawraw l-ġojjell li hi, hi stess, sfatat. Għalkemm ma kienx hekk sempliċi u faċli biex tagħmel kif ħafna demons u bnedmin mfittxija l-ġojjell għall-iskopijiet tagħhom stess. Hija ħabiba demonju żagħżugħ/a, monk, u baħri demonju li kollha vvjaġġaw magħha biex jirrestawraw il-ġojjell.<br/><br/>Madankollu, il-grupp tagħha ma kienx dak li jimla l-ġojjell, minflok, nofs id-dimostrazzjoni ħażen li rrappreżenta l-maġġoranza tal-avvenimenti ewlenin fil-biċċa l-kbira tal-ħajja tal-kumpanija tagħha. Meta fl-aħħar ġabar il-biċċiet kollha tal-ġojjell u għamel ix-xewqa tiegħu fuq l-oġġett imċaħħad, Kagome ġie mpinġi bil-ġojjell innifsu bl-intenzjoni li jagħmel ix-xewqa li jżomm ruħu maqbud ġewwa għal dejjem, filwaqt li jżomm il-ġojjell ħaj. Kien il-qawwija ta' Inuyasha li rnexxielha tiffrankaha mid-dlam. Fl-aħħar, hija marret lura għall-ħin naturali tagħha, lesti skola għolja kif kienet tistenna minn tfajla ta' żmienha. Hija kienet f'din id-dinja għal ħames snin, u ilha minn mindu ġiet fuq dar ta' ritorn. Hija ssaldat ħafna fil-ħajja ġdida tagħha.<br/><br/>platoniċi<br/><br/>Huwa pjuttost faċli għal Kagome li jagħmlu ħbieb ġodda, hi ma inbidel ħafna miż-żgħażagħ tagħha., Hija mara żagħżugħa ferrieħa li hija empatitika u tilqa' l-biċċa l-kbira ta' kulħadd f'ħajjitha. Anki d-dimostrazzjonijiet li kienu jieklu l-bnedmin, hija bbenefikat u biddlet il-modi tagħhom (hija bħal biex taħseb). Dan qed jingħad, huwa verament faċli li ssir ħabib tagħha sakemm xi ħadd ikun kapaċi li juru li huma lesti li jiġu mifdija, jew juru li mhumiex kompletament ħażen. Hija tħoss ħafna għal kulħadd hi jiltaqa', għalhekk huwa diffiċli li l-mara ma titpinġix lil oħrajn f'xewqa li tkun ħbieb.<br/><br/>antagonistiċi<br/><br/>L-uniku mod biex jaqilgħu l-gwerra tal-Kagome għandu jkun hekk deplorabbli, allura ħażen, u s'issa lil hinn mill-fidi li hi ma tistax tara xi tajba fik. U hi tista tara l-ġid fil-verament kapaċi ħafna kulħadd u kollox. A nofs-dimostrazzjoni li ppitat żewġ lovers kontra xulxin, li kkawża l-linja maskili kollha ta' wieħed mill-ħbieb tagħha, u mbagħad kellhom ħabib tagħha aħjar joqtlu lill-familja tagħhom... Yeah, ma tarax ha hating xi ħadd mingħajr ma verament, verament jaħdmu għaliha. Ħossok liberu li tagħti b'tir, għalkemm.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>Meta fl-imħabba, Kagame huwa appoġġ b'saħħtu, dejjem hemm anke meta l-affarijiet jistgħu jkunu ħorox. Madankollu, Kagame mhux qed ifittex l-imħabba meta wasal biex ma jkun hemm l-ebda relazzjonijiet tal-passat. Din mhix biex ngħidu li xi ħadd ma naqasx fl-imħabba magħha. Hi tista' definittivament tkun is-suġġett tal-imħabba mhux mixtieqa ta' xi ħadd, x'aktarx se tkun ovvja, għalkemm. Fl-aħħar nett, Kagsome attwalment huwa impenjat lejn is-Senshoumaru, b'mod sorprendenti. Jien totalment miftuħ għall-affarijiet potenzjali ta' AU, għalkemm. <3<br/><br/>infern tal-faddom<br/><br/>antiki ta' l-età<br/><br/>ir-reġina ta' l-ispazju speċi<br/><br/>żebgħa tax-xogħol<br/><br/>jippreferi hija/tagħha<br/><br/>għotjiet<br/><br/>pro hi/tagħha est 62wo i terda fil-plot tweġibiet., iżda kok anyway!!! labra hija ħbiberija ħafna u għandha li "cool" persona, huwa verament divertenti li tkun madwar, u huwa SUPER tajba biex jaħdmu ma'. bħal hu pazjent super u hu ser tagħmel xi ħaġa hi jitlob lilu-huwa verament faċli biex jaħdmu ma', definittivament meta mqabbla ma' mudelli oħra.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Għaliex Għandek tkun fuq Twitter<br/><br/>Dikjarazzjoni ta' ċaħda ta' responsabbiltà: M'iniex, u qatt ma tlabt li jien, gura tal-midja soċjali. Jien biss persuna li taħseb dwar l-ikel ħafna, u dan ħareġ għadd ta' drabi.<br/><br/>Xi kultant ma tieħuni snin biex insemmu dak li rrid nuża xi ħaġa qabel ma fil-fatt nikseb fuqha, u Twitter kien wieħed minn dawk l-affarijiet., Konna fuq Twitter serjament minn mindu dwar Frar ta'din is-sena, għalhekk jien pjuttost ġdid fiha. Xorta waħda, tgħallimt numru ta'affarijiet, u ridt li naqsmuhom. Xi nies ngħid jien fotografu Twitter, u jien, għax hemm ħafna raġunijiet tajbin biex naslu għaliha, u kważi l-ebda tnaqqis.<br/><br/>Allura x'hemm Twitter?Jekk int fuq l-internet, probabbilment mill-inqas mismugħa minnha., Huwa netwerk tal-midja soċjali li jservi bħala forum għal konverżazzjonijiet, aġġornamenti, u aħbarijiet f'pubbliku medju aktar minn xi ħaġa bħal Facebook jew LinkedIn. Facebook huwa dwar min trid issibek, iżda Twitter huwa dwar min trid issib. Il-kittieba favoriti tiegħek, l-atturi, il-politiċi, is-kantanti u x-xjentisti tiegħek x'aktarx huma fuq Twitter. Għalhekk huma l-varjetajiet favoriti tiegħek, l-istazzjonijiet tar-radju, is-siti tal-aħbarijiet u l-ħwienet. U jixtiequ li ssibhom u jisimgħu dak li għandhom jgħidu. Kulħadd fuq Twitter, mill-inqas inizjalment, irid jitkellem miegħek.<br/><br/>Imma għaliex jissieħbu li? Għaliex tkun parti minnha? Hemm kull tip ta'raġunijiet, u jien ser jagħtuk ftit.<br/><br/>In-nies u l-postijiet Twitter huwa mod tajjeb ħafna biex issir taf dwar avvenimenti li għaddejjin madwar id-dinja, iżda wkoll fil-komunità tiegħek. Jekk qed tivvjaġġa u tfittex affarijiet x'tagħmel, huwa mod tajjeb ħafna biex issir taf dwar affarijiet rilevanti għall-interessi tiegħek (għax in-nies li inti ssegwi huma nies li int interessat fihom).

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Kanali ta' l-għerq<br/><br/>Il-ħsieb ħafna li tikseb għerq kanal jpoġġi l-biċċa l-kbira tan-nies fuq ix-xifer.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Knisja ta'l-Injam<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Knisja ta'l-injam tal-qiegħ, Highgate<br/><br/>Issa msejħa Reġina ta'l-Injam<br/><br/>Bejn 1860 u 1860, iċ-ċentru twieled mill-Belt ta' Londra biex jibni drenaġġi, ferroviji u toroq ġodda. Id-djar ġew imnaqqsin mingħajr ma jitqies l-inkwilini li kellhom isibu xi akkomodazzjoni li setgħu x'imkien ieħor. Il-maniġers marru jgħixu f'Kensington u St. John's Wood, filwaqt li l-ifqar folla fir-rookies bħall-seba' Dials u Lison Grove. Għal dawk bejn, l-iskrivani u n-nisa b'ħiliet, il-bennejja spekulattivi poġġew ringiela ta' vilel miterjati u s-Sur Pouter imċaqlaq f'Holloway. In-nies ta' l-Hill tal-Muswell jara djar crepe madwar l-oqsma tal-Park Finsbury, sal-Hill tal-Couch u n-naħa l-oħra, sabiex sa 1880, Crouch End kien qed jiġi żviluppat u ma kien hemm l-ebda mod biex jitnaqqas il-fluss. Għaxar snin wara l-artijiet kbar tal-Għolja ta' Muswell kienu qed jinbiegħu. Upton Farm ġie mibjugħ u l-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi riedu jiżviluppaw il-Ġinja tal-Qawmien tal-Knisja, li issa kienet tissejjaħ l-Injam tar-Reġina. Żewġ gruppi ta' nies onesti, motivati ħafna jiġġieldu għal dak li kull ħsieb kien tajjeb. Il-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi minn naħa waħda u l-Kumitat tal-Karità tal-Qarn min-naħa l-oħra, it-tnejn li huma kienu jemmnu li kienu qed jagħmlu l-aħjar tagħhom għal nies oħra, u l-pubbliku tela' kontrihom kemm fl-inseminazzjoni<br/><br/>F'dak iż-żmien, Triq l-għoljiet Muswell kienet triq tal-pajjiż, bis-Sala tan-Nofsinhar f'tarf u r-razzett ta' Upton fl-ieħor. Sal-1894, il-Ġnien tal-Isla tal-Qawmien inbena, il-Ġnien tal-Kunnu, u l-bennejja kienu f'pożizzjoni li jiżviluppaw il-patrimonju tal-bosk. Aqta' l-injam tal-qiegħ tal-Knisja kien grupp ta' cottages mnejbin, fuq sit triangolu. Mappa mhux datata, miżmuma mill-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi, turi sitt katalgi tal-Iskart b'fetħa bejniethom - mhux b'triq, mhux metallizzat, iżda b'tali mod li wara s-sodda tal-frawli. Barra minn hekk, kien hemm diskrepanza oħra li wasslet għal mogħdijiet tal-ilma. Dawn iż-żewġ ftuħ kellhom ikunu l-bażi tal-pjan. L-istess żewġ lakuni u l-art imċajpra, li kienet il-kamp tal-frawli, tista' tidher fil-mappa ta' 1894 hawn taħt. Dawn jidhru bħala 'Muswell Hill Cottages' u, pjuttost meta jgħaddu, Peter Sellers kien jgħix fuq l-istess sit ħafna aktar tard. Sabiex jiġi żviluppat l-injam bħala patrimonju tad-djar, il-Kummissarji kellhom bżonn issuq żewġ toroq minn Triq l-Għolja ta' Muswell u jibnu djar fuqhom. Il-frontaġġ tat-Triq Muswell waħdu ma kienx jipprovdi lok għal biżżejjed djar biex jagħmlu l-intrapriża.<br/><br/>L-art u l-bagalji ngħataw ħafna qabel hekk kif l-ammhouses jinżammu f'pajjiżhom mit-Trustees tal-Kummissarji tal-Karità tal-Hornsey. Sal-1990 il-cottages kienu mdawwla, fi bżonn ta' tiswija maġġuri. L-ispirtu pubbliku, li jixtieq jagħmel l-aħjar għall-inkwilini qodma tagħhom, il-fiduċjai ma setgħux itejbuhom peress li ma kellhom l-ebda flus. Xi snin qabel ma l-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi kienu ppjanati li jiżviluppaw l-injam tal-Pit Grave (issa Highgate Wood) bħala patrimonju ta' akkomodazzjoni, iżda din kienet issodisfat tali oppożizzjoni li kienu appoġġjaw. Minflok, fl-1886, huma taw 69 acres injam lill-pubbliku. Fl-istess ħin li offrew biex ibigħu Churchyard Bottom Wood lil Hornsey Urban District Council għal £25,000, iżda dan kien wisq għall-Hornsey li tqajjem waħdu. Il-Kunsill qal li n-nies li jgħixu barra mill-Qarn kellhom ukoll igawdu mill-injam u minn awtoritajiet oħra għandhom jgħinu, iżda ma ngħatat l-ebda għajnuna. Fl-aħħar tal-offerta waqgħu fis-sospensjoni.<br/><br/>Mapep li juru l-Futaġġi tal-Għolja ta' Muswell li kienu ċ-ċentru tal-kontroversja.<br/><br/>Triq l-għoljiet tal-Muswell madwar 1880<br/><br/>Jidher probabbli li dawn it-tliet pari ta' cottages kienu dawk fiċ-ċentru tat-tilwima.<br/><br/>Il-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi riedu jżidu l-flus għax-xogħol tal-knisja fil-Gran Brittanja u barra minn Malta. Huma qiesu li kienu ngħataw l-art biex tintuża għall-propropagatíion ta' reliġjon u jekk dan kien ifisser li tbiegħ l-art jew l-imsaġar, kien inqas ħażen milli jirrestrinġi x-xogħol tal-knisja. Huma kienu taw lil Gervel Pit Wood lill-pubbliku: fil-post tagħha huma kienu jiżviluppaw Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Il-Ġejjieni tal-Karità tal-Qarn riedu jipproduċu dħul biex jgħinu lin-nies fqar tagħhom, u għalhekk huma għamlu offerta lill-Kummissarji. Il-biċċa l-kbira tal-art tinbidel wisq biex tiġi żviluppata ekonomikament, iżda jekk il-Kummissarji jagħtuhom aktar art biex jagħmluha f'sit kwadru, dawn jibnu ħamsa u għoxrin rivali puliti. Dawn se jwasslu għal kera fl-art ta' £225 fis-sena, li tista' tintuża biex ittaffi l-faqar tan-nies ta' Horney, u b'hekk tippermetti lill-Kummissjoni biex tnaqqas żewġ toroq permezz tal-art tagħhom sabiex il-Kummissarji jkunu jistgħu jiżviluppaw l-imsaġar.<br/><br/>Meta din l-offerta saret magħrufa n-nies immedjatament irreaġixxew bl-allarm.<br/><br/>Fis-16 ta' Diċembru 1989, J. Carvel Williams MP talab lill-Kamra tal-Komuni, jekk il-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi kienu taw il-kunsens tagħhom biex ibigħu strixxa tal-art lejn il-Ġranet tal-Karitàs bil-kundizzjoni li triq eżistenti titwessa' għal 40 pied, jekk din kinitx skema ta' bini u jekk il-Kamra tal-Parlament ikollu l-opportunità li jesprimi opinjoni.<br/><br/>Is-Sur Levon Gower, Kummissarju għall-Esperti tal-Knisja wieġeb," Iva" għall-ewwel parti.<br/><br/>Is-Sur Carltell Williams, "Tifhem li huwa l-intenzjoni li jeqirdu dak il-porzjon ta' Woods Highgate billi jibnu fuqha?"<br/><br/>Jumejn wara l-istilla ppubblikat artiklu denja ta' kwalunkwe tabbilojdi moderna.<br/><br/>L-istilla ta' l-<br/>18 ta' Diċembru 1893<br/><br/>Il-Parlament irid iżomm għassa kerha fuq dawk il-qaddejja l-qodma u l-konfederati tal-bennej tal-meruċerija l-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi. Huma dejjem qed itaffu xi biċċa art jew qed jiffavorixxu l-bennejja għall-kuntrarju tal-pubbliku ġenerali. Il-Kummissarji ma jbigħux l-injam tal-qiegħ tal-Knisja lil dawk li jħallsu r-rati imma issa jipproponu ‘biex jiftħuh' billi jaqtgħu żewġ toroq wiesgħa permezz tiegħu b'rabta ma' waħda mill-bosta skemi ta' bini tagħhom. Mhux xi ħadd ma jistaqsi xi mistoqsija fil-Parlament u jivverifika l-politika briks u mehrież tal-Kummissarji?'<br/><br/>Sa meta ġiet stampata din id-domanda, id-domanda kienet ġiet mitluba u t-tweġiba kienet jew mhux vera, jew diversa. Dokumenti oħra ħarġu mill-istorja. It-Times, f'rapport twil, qalu li l-Konsumaturi ma kinux lesti li jagħtu impriża li l-Parlament, jew kwalunkwe korp pubbliku ieħor, għandu jkollhom l-opportunità li jikkunsidraw kwalunkwe skema għall-bini fuq is-sit tal-injam.<br/><br/>Is-sitwazzjoni kienet ta' tmintax-il xahar sakemm il-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi kienu sfurzati jiftħu inkjesta, li bdiet f'Highgate fil-31 ta' Mejju 1895, ppreseduta minn Kummissarju Ekkleżjastiku. L-Inkjesta pproduċiet nixxiegħa ta' ittri tal-gazzetti li tagħhom dan kien l-aktar importanti.<br/><br/>Il-Kronċi ta' Kuljum, 5 ta' Ġunju 1895<br/><br/>Vandali ta' l-ATHIGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Waħda mill-aktar bits sabiħ ta' art tal-injam fis-suburan London hija mhedda.Tista' tgħinna biex inneħħu x'ikun kalmant, mhux biss għad-distrett immedjat, iżda biss għad-distrett kollu ta' Londra tat-Tramuntana b'popolazzjoni densa? Fl-ebda parti tal-metropoli ma kien il-bennej tal-bini aktar attiv milli fit-Tendu ta' Crouch u Hornsey. Il-mergħat sbieħ ta' sena jew tnejn ilu issa huma djar u ħwienet. Il-munzelli tal-Ballasta ħadu l-post ta' l-elementi u s-setts li għadhom jeżistu, u ladarba l-villaġġi pjaċevoli qed jaqsmu d-destin ta' l-Strond Green, Harary, Finsbury Park, Highbury u Islington.<br/><br/>---L-għan huwa l-kostruzzjoni ta' żewġ toroq erbgħin-saqajn permezz ta' l-imsaġar. Aħna f'dan id-distrett nafu t-tifsira ta' l-forty-saqajn toroq permezz ta' l-imsaġar. Għaxar snin ilu aġitazzjoni salvat l-injam tal-għaġeb ta' sittin acres - L-injam tal-Pit Gravel - u l-ebda wieħed li ra l-folla tal-vaganzi tal-Bank f'wiċċ it-triq mill-toroq tad-dar ta' Holloway, Islington u Clerenwell, u ra t-tgawdija ħerqana tat-tfal u l-partiti tal-familja pikkanti fuq il-ħaxix u fost is-siġar, ma setax jirrealizza l-għadma immensa li l-għotja mill-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastika ta 'dan l-injam kienet għal kollox ta' Londra, iżda l-injam t'sitta kien dejjem meqjus bħala kumpliment naturali tal-ieħor. ----<br/><br/>--- Il-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi huma stess kważi terz tal-parroċċa kbira ta' Horny MILF Chat. Bl-infiq liberali tal-flus tal-kontribwenti fil-ftuħ tat-toroq u l-iżvilupp ġenerali tad-distrett, il-valur tal-proprjetà tagħhom żdied b'mod enormi, u minn dan iż-żieda mhux ippjanata kull sena jagħmlu dħul kbir. B'hekk, dawk li jħallsu r-rati li l-flus tagħhom b'hekk għenu biex jinħolqu l-proprjetà enormi jistgħu jistennew trattament liberali lura. ---<br/><br/>Tiegħek b'ġentilezza,<br/><br/>Iffirmata mill-Vicar ta' San Ġakbu, l-Għolja ta' Muswell, il-Ministru tal-Kappella tal-Park ta' Crouch End, avukat li jgħix f'Onslow Gardens u tliet membri tal-Kunsill tad-Distrett.<br/><br/>Kien dritt b'tir fil-kotba tal-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi, il-mexxejja reliġjużi tagħhom stess u l-Kunsill tad-Distrett, kollha f'armi li fil-fatt qalu li l-knisja kienet wisq rikka u għandha tkun karità, u mhux greedy. L-inklużjoni taż-żewġ membri tal-kleru kienet moviment qawwi. Ftakar li dan kien għadu fl-għoli tal-konversjoni ta' Darwin. Darwin kien jaqsam it-twemmin fit-tagħlim tal-Knisja u ta' ħafna nies kien ikun rrappreżenta l-qawwa tal-Knisja minn dak il-punt biss. Il-Knisja ma kinitx żgur hekk kif kienet qiegħda ssir.<br/><br/>L-Aħbarijiet ta' filgħaxija, 7 ta' Ġunju 1895 qal:<br/><br/>"Jekk il-Klijenti Ekkleżjastiċi ma jiġux indirizzati f'daqqa waħda, l-oppost tal-bini se jikseb qabda tal-injam li se tkun diffiċli ħafna biex tinħall aktar tard, ---. Għalhekk hu jemmen li Londrars ikunu u jagħmlu jekk huma se jiffrankaw wieħed mill-bits aktar imghodd tagħhom ta' xeni rustiċi. L-inkjesta pubblika tmur ħdejn il-Ħamis li jmiss, u qabel ma trid issir xi ħaġa biex tikkonvinċi lill-Kummissarji li ċ-ċittadini ta' Londra mhux se jittolleraw il-konfiska ta' wieħed mill-grawnds favoriti tagħhom."<br/><br/>Ittra fil-Kronċi ta' Kuljum l-jum li jmiss qal: -<br/><br/>... Kien b'ħelsien kbir li r-residenti, xi għaxar snin ilu, mismugħa li x-xiri tal-Upper Wood kien ġie effettwat; u kif kien ġie mġiegħel lil xi ħadd li żarhom jista' jixhed, imma dak kollu li eżerċita ruħu biex isalva dawn l-imsaġar ta' fuq, li jinsabu fuq in-naħa tal-punent tat-triq tal-għoljiet ta' Muswell, ħass li r-rebħa tagħhom ma kinitx kompluta sakemm is-sitta akri fuq in-naħa tal-Lvant baqgħet fil-periklu. Peress li kien hemm inċident li l-imsaġar huma maqsuma b'triq għolja wiesgħa. Jista' xi ħadd jiddubita x'inhu l-effett li kieku l-Perù tal-Knisja kien se jiġi sostitwit b'ringieli ta' vilel żgħar, kull wieħed jibgħat il-kontribut tiegħu tad-duħħan u l-aktar? Jista' jkun hemm xi dubju, ukoll, dwar id-differenza serja li tagħmel għall-iffissar pittoresk tal-boskijiet mixtrija jekk linja ta' djar ġodda tal-bidu kellha tiġi drittata kontra l-frontage tal-weraq tagħhom?'<br/><br/>Dan esprima l-opinjonijiet ta' ħafna nies. Fil-fatt, il-Gravel Pit Wood, li l-kittieb isejħet lill-'Upper Wood', ma kienx ġie mixtri, iżda ngħata d-distrett mill-Kummissjoni Ekkleżjastika, punt li kellu jerġa' jirtira l-ħin u għal darb'oħra matul is-snin, iżda ħafna nies injorawh. Il-Kummissjoni ma kinitx sejra tagħti lil hinn mit-tieni injam kulma qal, u żammet din il-pożizzjoni sal-aħħar.<br/><br/>H.S. Chamberlain, ta' 5 Cranley Gardens, f'ittra lill-Times datat Ġunju 8, 1895, xiri imħeġġeġ.<br/><br/>Naf li huwa komuni li nitkellmu bir-reqqa tal-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi, iżda peress li l-fiduċjai ta' fond li huma marbuta li jamministrawh għall-akbar vantaġġ, u għalhekk, jekk xi ħaġa li għandha ssir biex isalva t-twaqqigħ tal-injam, jidher li tista' ssir biss għax-xiri tal-proprjetà mill-Konsumaturi, li naf, huma kompletament ħajjin għall-protezzjoni tal-ispazji liberi u miftuħa għan-nies, u li, jiena nħossni ċert, se nkunu qed nittrattaw il-kwistjoni ta' xiri fi spirtu ħieles u liberali, kif diġà għamlu fil-kwistjoni tal-Cothered's Cotherherhed, billi toffri kiri lill-Kumpanija tal-Logħob tal-Azzar tal-Frokka – kumpanija żgħira li fiha jiena stess, kumpanija żgħira li ġiet iffurmata esklussivament għall-iskop li tiżgura l-oqsma għall-cricket, tennis, eċċ.<br/><br/>(Dan jirreferi l-Oqsma tal-Logħob tal-Għid ta' Crouch li ġew assigurati ftit snin wara.)<br/><br/>Bħala President tal-Assoċjazzjoni Konservattivi tal-Għolja ta' Muswell, għandi kuntatt kostanti mal-abitanti, u nista' naffermazzjoni b'sigurtà li kull persuna residenti fil-viċinat tagħmel xi ħaġa b'raġuni biex nippreżerva ruħha.<br/><br/>(Kull ma riedx personalment kien dħul ta' karità biex jappoġġja lin-nies ħżiena tiegħu. Huwa talab l-fejqan tal-art tiegħu - mhux ftehim kbir żgur - huwa kien jemmen li l- Kummissarju assigurazzjoni li l-injam ma kienx f'periklu.)<br/><br/>'Muswell Hill Road kienet waħda mill-aqwa fil-Qarn u tibqa' daqstant sabiħa, djar jew ebda djar',<br/><br/>(u mbagħad daħal l-art retorika kbira.)<br/><br/>'Huwa l-foqra li jbatu minħabba l-oġġezzjonijiet sentimentali u l-għajta steretika ta' 'wolup biss imqajma mill-korrispondenti tiegħek?, Xi ħaġa għandha ssir u li dalwaqt. A kurva ta' art lura miżjuda mal-patrimonju tal-karità ma tagħmel l-ebda differenza apprezzabbli lill-art li jifdal, filwaqt li l-profitt li jirriżulta minnha jokkorru ħafna nies qodma u deservanti fis-snin ta' tnaqqis tagħhom u jippermettulna nagħtu lill-aventi kawża tagħna li fil-futur imbiegħed tkun ta' valur kbir fil-preżentazzjoni tal-għajnuna karità lill-foqra li jixirqilhom l-parroċċi tal-Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Meta qrat l-ittra tiegħu wieħed sens taʼ isterjuża ħafna ħdejn il-wiċċ. Għaliex qies li l- Kummissarji riedu jibnu triq? Għala għandhom iqattgħu l-flus kollha jekk ma jibnux djar? Hu qatt ma deher li tirrealizza li għal ejker tal-art l-injam kollu tintilef. Imma kien bil-problema għal żmien twil. Kien il-persuna li lilha l-Kummissarji għamlu l-offerta ta' bejgħ għal £25,000 sena qabel u huwa ismu li huwa onorat f'plakka fuq it-Torri tal-arloġġ ta' Crouch End biex isalva l-injam, iżda l-fiduċja tiegħu fil-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi tidher waħda. Huwa qal li fl-inkjesta kien se jitfa' bħala l-devil.<br/><br/>L-inkjesta kompliet<br/><br/>Il-Kamra tal-Kunsill ġiet mibdula kompletament. It-tabelli tas-soltu kienu jitneħħew u l-kamra mimlija b'siġġijiet fil-15 ta' Ġunju 1895. Minn nofs wara 'l quddiem, il-kamra ġiet iffullata, u n-nies qed jorqdu għas-siġġijiet.<br/><br/>Is-Sur Murray, il-Kummissarju, qal li l-inkjesta kienet tassew waħda sempliċi. Bliet tal-Paċjali ta' Horney xtaqu jixtru biċċa art ħdejn il-proprjetà tal-karità tagħhom fuq wara. Il-mistoqsija kienet dwar jekk il-Kummissjoni tal-Karità, li kienet tikkontrolla l-karitajiet kollha, kellhiex biżżejjed setgħa biex twaqqafhom. Il-Kummissarji tal-Knisja tħejjew biex ibigħu l-art b'termini favorevoli ħafna u d-dħul tal-Karità jiżdied b'mod konsiderevoli.<br/><br/>F'dan il-każ kien hemm tliet klassijiet ta' oġġezzjoni.<br/><br/>Il-Fiduċja oriġinali kienet għall-iskop li tipprovdi cottages għall-Port il-Kbir, iżda t-trustees kienu jipproponu li jibnu villas li kienu jiswew wisq għall-Port il-Kbir. Madankollu, kien fil-poter tal-Fiduċjarji li jvarja t-termini tat-Trust, sabiex ikunu jistgħu jibnu villas jekk huma ħasbu li l-Fqar se jibbenefikaw fl-aħħar. Il-foqra huma stess jistgħu joġġezzjonaw, iżda d-dispożizzjonijiet liberali diġà ġew imwiegħed għalihom. It-tielet oġġezzjoni dwar l-estetika u n-naħa pubblika tal-kwistjoni. Huwa ħa minn dak li kien qara li l-Kummissjoni tal-Karità kellha tinterferixxi mal-Kummissarji Ekkleżjastiċi milli jeżerċitaw id-diskrezzjoni tagħhom stess fit-trattament tal-proprjetà tagħhom stess.<br/><br/>L-inkjesta iddiskutiet il-punti ta' multa, iżda l-kelliema żammew lura għall-problema ewlenija tal-prevenzjoni ta' kwalunkwe qerda tal-injam. Il-Vesty Clerk ta' Islington, li jirrappreżentaw 300,000 persuna, għamel protesta formali dwar kwalunkwe parti tal-injam, għalhekk siewja għall-poplu ta' Islington u Hornsey li qed jintuża għal skopijiet privati. Is-Sur Wilfred White qal li jekk il-Kummissarji jagħtuhom iż-żmien li jkunu jistgħu jgħollu l-flus biex jikkumpensaw lill-Fiduċjarji.<br/><br/>Is-Sur Beaumont qal li ma riedx li l-villaġġi, riedu jmorru lil nies ħżiena li kienu misjuqa mid-distrett. Oħrajn qalu li ma kien hemm l-ebda flus biex il-cottages jiġu ssostitwiti minn dawn il-persuni mejtin, iżda l-irħula kienu jkunu propożizjoni ekonomika. Oħrajn tennew li kien hemm skor ta' vilel biex inħallsu l-Għoli. Waħħal għall-kwistjoni ta' l-injam.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher qal li l-għajta fost in-nies tax-xogħol kienet li m'hemmx għalfejn tmur. In-nies tax-xogħol ġew lilu bil-għajta, "Aħna huma misjuqa minn Highgate u huma obbligati li jmorru lejn il-Belt l-Ġdida. " Jekk il-front tat-Triq tal-Muswell Hill ma kienx hemm kwistjoni iżda li t-toroq jistgħu jinqatgħu mill-imsaġar fid-direzzjoni ta' Horney, iżda jekk il-Kummissarji ma setgħux jiksbu l-art mill-Kummissjoni tal-Karità ma setgħux inaqqsu t-triq.<br/><br/>Kien ċert ħafna li l-cottage tista' titqiegħed fi stat tajjeb ta' tiswija. Huwa ġie mistoqsi mill-foqra, mill-pulizija u minn għadd ta' klassijiet ta' ħidma biex jirrappreżenta dawn iż-żewġ punti, li l-akkomodazzjoni tal-bagalji kienet meħtieġa ħafna f'Highgate u li, ladarba jitħallew jinbiegħu l-art, ma kien hemm l-ebda indikazzjoni dwar fejn l-idejn tal-bennej kien se jibqa' toqgħod.<br/><br/>(Kerċetti b'saħħithom u fit-tul).<br/><br/>Għadd ta' nies oħra tkellmu u l-Kummissarju qal li huwa ħa l-opinjoni prevalenti favur iż-żamma tal-bagalji iżda l-laqgħa m'għandha tiġbed l-ebda konklużjonijiet minn dak li kien qal (il-Granni).<br/><br/>Oħrajn qalu li t-Trustees tal-Karità naqas f'idejh id-dmirijiet tagħhom billi ħalla l-cottages jaqgħu fi sparixxa.<br/><br/>Is-Sur H.R. Williams, il-fiduċja li kienet kitbet lill-karta aktar kmieni, qal li kellu fuq l-aħjar awtorità li l-Kummissarji tal-Knisja ma se jagħmlu l-ebda triq u ma jibbenefikawx minn otta waħda bl-azzjonijiet tal-Kummissarji tal-Karità. Oħrajn kienu ferm inqas ta' fiduċja u l-laqgħa għalqet wara kważi tliet sigħat.<br/><br/>'Aħna qegħdin niffaċċjaw il-fatt li fl-Għolja u fil-Muswell Hill hemm numru ta' persuni li jixtiequ li l-Ġejjieni tal-Injam u mhux se jkunu kuntenti sakemm ma jkunux kisbuh - filwaqt li ħadd ma jidher lest li jqattgħu razzett biex iħallsu għaliha. Kulħadd jgħid li jkun ħaġa multa li jkollhom l-injam bħala spazju miftuħ, iżda kulħadd jaħseb li huwa d-dmir ta' xi ħadd ieħor li jagħmilha waħda. Il-Vesty ta' Islington 'rsolvi' fuq is-suġġett, iżda l-Vestry ta' Islington ma joffrix biċċa penny lejn ix-xiri. -- M'hemm l-ebda problema aktar diffiċli għall-komunità jew għall-individwu biex isolvu milli kif tikseb il-pussess tal-propjetà ta' ħaddieħor mingħajr ma jħallas għaliha.'<br/><br/>Fil-fatt, il-ħlas għal din il-problema sar l-oġġett ta' dibattitu lokali u nazzjonali intensiv, li ġie ffurmat minn kumitat konġunt biex isalva l-injam. Fl-20 ta' Novembru 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, l-Onor Treasurer, kiteb lill-Istandard, karta ta' kuljum f'dak iż-żmien, appell għall-għajnuna. Huwa fakkar lil kulħadd tal-periklu li jitlef l-injam u qal li dan jista' jiġi ssejvjat biss għax-xiri tiegħu. Il-Kummissarji tal-Knisja se jbiegħu għal £ 25,000 u extra (5,000) biex jagħmlu total ta' £30,000. Dan kien wisq biex il-Kunsill tal-Hornsey jiġbor iżda diġà vvutaw £ 10,000 għat-total. L-imsaġar kienu ta' valur indispensabbli għal kulħadd ta' Londra u għalhekk huwa appella lill-korpi pubbliċi u lin-nies privati biex iqajmu l-bqija ta' £20,000. Huwa wissa li l-offerta preżenti mill-Kummissarji tal-Knisja kienet miftuħa biss għall-aħħar tas-sena 1898. Wara li l-bennejja jiċċaqalqu f'dan.<br/><br/>L-appell intlaqa' bil-qalb mill-istampa, u issa ġie mgħasses permezz tal-Parlament u l-Att dwar il-Preservazzjoni tal-Imsaġar, 1897, li issa sar il-liġi. Il-Kunsill kellu d-dritt li jirriklama għall-kontribuzzjonijiet lejn ix-xiri tal-injam u l-preservazzjoni tiegħu.<br/><br/>Fi żmien pjuttost qasir kważi l-flus kollha tqajmu, iżda l-aħħar eluf ta' snin wrew diffikultà ħafna biex jgħollu u l-iskadenza tal-Kummissarji kienet kwistjoni ta' ġimgħat bogħod. Is-Sur Cory-Wright kiteb li wieġeb għal aktar żmien, iżda ngħata biss tliet xhur u mbagħad biss jekk l-interess ta' 4 fil-mija tħallas għall-perjodu addizzjonali fuq is-somma sħiħa. Fl-aħħar, il-Kunsill tal-Kontea ta' Londra, li oriġinarjament offra £ 2,500, għamel dan sa £5,000 u t-total intlaħaq, iżda kienet ħaġa mill-qrib.<br/><br/>Il-Kunsill iddeċieda li jerġa'isem l-Injam bħala 'Queen's Woods' fl-unur tar-Reġina Victoria's Diamond Jubilee u Hornsy qiegħdu fuq il-wiri multa ta' bunting meta d-Duki ta' Albany iddikjara formalment l-Injam miftuħa 'għall-użu liberu tal-pubbliku għal dejjem'.<br/><br/>Filwaqt li l-kampanja biex isalva l-injam tal-qiegħ tal-Knisja kienet immexxija u diretta minn nies lokali li ħassew b'passjoni dwar din il-biċċa partikulari tal-injam, huma appellaw għall-għajnuna u għall-esperjenza ta' netwerk kbir ta' nies, li wħud minnhom ħadmu flimkien f'kampanji simili għal aktar minn tletin sena. Il-Kumitat ħareġ appell, stampati fuq karta ta' kwalità tajba ħafna u li jkollhom xi ismijiet famużi.<br/><br/>Il-mistoqsijiet ta' spazju miftuħ u tas-saħħa pubblika kienu suġġetti ewlenin tal-viżjoni Victoria.<br/><br/>Il-Moviment ta' l-Ispazju Miftuħ<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, ir-riforma kbira tad-djar, li bdiet bi tliet djar antiki f'Marylebone, xtara għaliha minn Jolm Ruskin, malajr saret espert dwar id-djar tal-foqra fil-kundizzjonijiet tas-saħħa possibbli. Mod tagħha kien li jixtru l-kiri u mbagħad knock isfel xi wħud mill-djar crowded sabiex iġibu dawl u l-arja għall-bqija, jemmen li l-arja friska u xemx kienu l-uniku mod kif in-nies foqra jistgħu jiġu ssejvjati minn "purtrid deni. Hija kienet tgħallmu dan bħala tifel mill-grandfather tagħha, Southwood Smith, li żviluppat teoriji tiegħu fl-Isptar Festa fis-Salib ta' King.<br/><br/>Huwa kien bena l-ewwel dari industrijali għal nies ħżiena u kien wera statistikament li l-arja tajba u d-drenaġġ deċenti iffrankaw il-ħajjiet. Gibson Gardens, fit-triq tat-tramuntana, huwa riżultat dirett ta' l-ideat ta' Southwood Smith. Aktar informazzjoni dwar Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>L-importanza ta' l-arja miftuħa<br/><br/>Spazji miftuħa u l-opportunità li tieħu n-nifs ta' arja nadifa, kienu essenzjali għall-persuni li jgħixu f'waħda jew żewġ kmamar iffullati. Hija tant iħobb l-oqsma tal-Avenja Fitzjohn's li kienet tipprova tixtrihom bħala park pubbliku. Kienu jiswew £ 10,000 u fi żmien tliet ġimgħat ta' Awwissu £8,500 inqajmu. Kien hemm bżonn biss it-tmiem tal-vaganzi tas-sajf u r-ritorn mill-vaganzi ta' ħbieb simpatija u aktar £ 1,500, iżda s-sidien f'daqqa rtirat l-offerta tagħhom. Minkejja li l-oqsma kollha kienu koperti minn djar kbar.<br/><br/>Minn dan żviluppat il-kampanja biex issalva l-għolja tal-Parlament, l-ispazju miftuħ li jmiss lejn it-tramuntana ta' Londra Grove, tixtri l-għelieqi fit-triq tal-bennejja biex jagħmlu santwarju ta' detonazzjoni permanenti kontra l-briks ta' avvanz. Il-kampanja tal-Parlament Hill Fields tant kienet ta' suċċess li l-Hampstead Heath Bill kien għadda u kien hemm flus aktar mill-appell. Minn dan il-flus u l-impetu lejn l-ispazji miftuħa, kien li jiżviluppa l-fiduċja nazzjonali. Octavia Hill kien interessat fil-protezzjoni ta' żoni bħall-Knisja Bottom Wood għal snin, għalhekk hija kienet naturali b'mod naturali fil-ġlieda biex isalva l-Injam.<br/><br/>Is-Soċjetà Komuni għall-Preservazzjoni kienet familjari ma' dan it-tip ta' aġitazzjoni u ġbir ta' flus. Huma kienu waqqgħu ċnut meta Lords tal-bniedem kienu magħluqa biċċiet ta' art komuni, li kienu jwasslu l-battalji legali u illegali kontra l-privatizzazzjoni arroganti tal-art tradizzjonalment ħielsa. Robert Hunter, is-Solicitor Onorarju tagħhom minn 1868, dejjem kien mħasseb dwar l-iżgurar ta' spazji miftuħa, kbar jew żgħar, għall-pubbliku. Hu, issa Sir Hunter, sar iċ-Chairman tal-Appell tal-Qiegħ tal-Knisja. Il-President tas-Soċjetà Komuni għall-Preżervazzjoni kien is-Sur Shaw-Leffre MP (aktar 'il quddiem il-“Lord Eversley) li kellu sehem kbir f'dan il-qasam u kampanji oħra fil-Kamra tal-Komunjonijiet.<br/><br/>Fl-istess ħin Octavia Hill kien qed ikampa għal Abbozz ta' Liġi dwar il-Burlis.<br/><br/>Il-knisja tal-Belt saret tant sħiħa u tali periklu serju għas-saħħa, billi kkontaminati b'bjar li minnhom in-nies inxewx l-ilma tax-xorb tagħhom, li l-bjarli tal-Belt ma kinux permessi aktar. Minflok, saru ċerimonji fuq l-outskits tal-belt. Abney Park Cemetary kien wieħed minn dawn. Imbagħad kien hemm moviment biex jitneħħew l-irjus mat-truf tas-simenti antiki tal-belt, jerġgħu jidħlu fil-korpi x'imkien ieħor u jibdlu ċ-ċimiteri fil-ġonna u fl-ispazji miftuħa, minflok jibnu fuqhom. Din l-art fiċ-ċentru ta' Londra kienet ta' valur kbir u l-ispekulaturi kienu qed jagħtuha: Anke l-Kwakers kienu mibnija fuq wieħed miċ-ċertifikati tagħhom u kienu mhedda li jagħmlu dan mill-ġdid billi jibnu fuq il-grawnds tal-Bunghill. Octavia Hill kellu netwerk ta' alleati f'oqsma għexieren, u għalhekk l-għajnuna tagħha biex tiffranka l-Injam tal-Knisja għandha tkun ta' valur.<br/><br/>Is-Soċjetà Metropolitana tal-Ġnien, stabbilita fi 1882, ħarġet madwar żewġ mitt ġnien żgħir fiċ-ċentri tal-belt sa 1890. Huma aktar tard tawhom lill-Awtoritajiet Lokali, u b'hekk l-appoġġ tagħhom għall-Appell tal-Injam tal-Knisja kien assigurat mill-bidu.<br/><br/>Is-Soċjetà Kyle tintesa issa, iżda fil-jum tagħha kellha influwenza kbira fuq l-Ippjanar tal-Belt u l-leġiżlazzjoni spazjali miftuħa. Is-Soċjetà ġiet imwaqqfa madwar 1875 għad-"Disfinizzjoni tas-sbuħija", biex iġġib il-kulur u l-interess fil-ħajja tan-nies li jgħixu fid-dullu, tinżel l-inħawi.Il-kulur jgħajjat għall-ħitan u d-dekorazzjoni, kantieri tajbin, spazji miftuħa, Natura, letteratura u arti. Dawn kollha kienu jaqgħu taħt il-mandat tas-Soċjetà. Kien hemm fergħa dekorattiva, li għaliha kien hemm William Morris lek; fergħa mużikali biex tippromwovi kor u lejla ta' kuntenti għan-nies fil-bini tal-iskola lokali; u fergħa tal-letteratura. Is-Soċjetà appellat b'mod regolari minn ittri f'The Times, għal 'l-klassijiet l-iktar għonja' għall-kotba u l-perjodiċi biex jitqassmu lill-klabbs tas-subien u tal-bniet, l-almhouses u x'imkien ieħor. L-isem 'Kyrle' ġie mill-bniedem tal-Papa ta' Ross, il-filantropu li tah il-post fejn twieled in-nies bħala park pubbliku. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it. Dana finds out her estranged husband and his girlfriend are found dead in the New Mexico desert. I was immediately drawn in by her character and the story. I really enjoyed seei... | Ma Thanksgiving madwar il-kantuniera, hawn xi logħob tal-fowlder tal-fajl tal-festi li għamilna għall-bniet., Kemm logħob tal-imħabba tiffoka fuq il-ħiliet tal-matematika., U jien grat għal darb'oħra lill-raġel tiegħi, Ed, biex jagħmlu l-klipp għalija kollha.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving mudell Deċiżjonijiet<br/><br/>Bħall-isem jgħid, din il-logħba hija dwar li jagħmlu mudelli., Ftit dawk li jitgħallmu dwar il-mudelli, jistgħu sempliċiment jaqblu mal-istampi fuq l-istrixxi tal-mudell, filwaqt li oħrajn jistgħu jkomplu l-mudell bil-karti tal-istampi fuq l-istrixxi vojta.<br/><br/>Biex tagħmel il-fowlder tal-fajl, inti tixtieq maqtugħa l-grilja ta' l-istampi li jagħmlu l-biċċiet tal-karta.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | L-użu tal-alkoħol minn persuni taħt l-età 21 ġie identifikat bħala problema maġġuri għas-saħħa pubblika. L-istudji jqisu li dan iżid ir-riskji għad-diżabilità, u jista' jkun ta' detriment għall-moħħ li qed jiżviluppa. Il-minorenni li jixrob huma aktar probabbli li jwettqu suwiċidju, jiksru l-liġi, jew ikunu vittmi ta' vjolenza.L-alkoħol huwa implikat f'kważi terz tal-fatalitajiet tat-traffiku taż-żgħażagħ. L-ispiża totali annwali tax-xorb taħt l-età hija stmata għal $62 biljun. Filwaqt li ħafna liġijiet maħsuba biex jipprevjenu x-xorb taħt l-età jgħaddu fil-livell tal-istat, kien hemm attività leġiżlattiva u interess fil-livell federali li jappoġġja l-isforzi tal-istati biex titnaqqas il-problema. Dan ir-rapport jiddeskrivi l-firxa tal-użu tal-alkoħol taħt l-età, l-attività leġiżlattiva reċenti dwar din il-kwistjoni, u diversi implikazzjonijiet ta' politika. Se tiġi aġġornata hekk kif data ġdida ssir disponibbli. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?
