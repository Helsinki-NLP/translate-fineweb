| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Verament kapaċi Bluetooth Headset jieħu kmandi tal-vuċi<br/><br/>Biċċa l-kbira tal-Bluetooth headsets huma perfettament kapaċi tal-vuċi arloġġ ħaġa, li jassumi li l-telefown ċellulari konnessi jistgħu jagħmlu dan, imma l-BlueAnt V1 jieħu l-kontroll tal-vuċi għall-għoli ġdid. Il-headset Bluetooth oerhört huwa jitqiegħed fis-suq bħala l-ewwel darba b'interface vera ta' utent ibbażat fuq il-vuċi.<br/><br/>Minflok tikklikkja l-buttuna fiżika biex twieġeb is-sejħiet tiegħek, sempliċiment titkellem fil-mikrofonu u tgħid "aċċetta sejħa". kmandi ta' vuċi bażika oħra jistgħu jinkludu "volum sa", "irrifjuta sejħa", jew "tagħmel il-londri". Okay, forsi mhux se tagħmel dan l-aħħar ħaġa, iżda tista' tara kif esperjenza kompletament imbagħbsa bħal dik offruta mill-BlueAnt V1 tista' tkun eċċellenti għax-xufiera u nies oħra li għandhom bżonn l-idejn tagħhom. Dan huwa għaliex int bl-użu ta' headset Bluetooth fl-ewwel post.<br/><br/>Il-downdown huwa li l-kontroll tal-vuċi jistgħu jkunu "wony" u jista' jkun pjuttost frustranti meta inti aċċidentalment jagħtiha kmand li ma tridx tagħmel. X'jiġri jekk int fis-sejħa ma' xi ħadd u inti jiġri li jgħidu "it-tmiem sejħa"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | l–Erbgħa, Lulju 06, 2005<br/><br/>Qed tmur għand il-kulleġġ? SHARE<br/><br/>Hawnhekk hawn artiklu ieħor kbir dwar is-sistema tal-immigrazzjoni tagħna li qed tfalli (u dejjem aktar redikoli), din id-darba mill-Globe Boston. L-immigranti li ma ġewx iddokumentati ta' 18-il sena minn Massachusetts ingħataw borża ta' studju ta' erba' snin f'università statali minħabba l-punteġġi ta' testijiet għoljin tagħha, iżda din l-aktar tard ġiet residjata ladarba l-uffiċjali tal-istat sabu l-istatus ta' immigrazzjoni tagħha. Kif jgħid l-awtur ta' dan l-artiklu,<br/><br/>"Għal ħafna biex jiċċelebraw il-blokki tal-bini għas-suċċess u l-ħolma Amerikana., Ruma tgħid, xorti diffiċli jekk inti smart, hardworking, u t-tfal ta' immigranti illegali."<br/><br/>Huwa lil hinn minn lili għaliex xi ħadd jixtieq li jżomm lit-tfal intelliġenti, għolja-kisba bħal din waħda mill-kulleġġ. Xi ħadd verament jaħseb li meta jiċħad it-tagħlim fl-istat u l-boroż ta' studju lill-immigranti mhux dokumentati se jagħmel lill-immigranti potenzjali jaħsbu darbtejn dwar kif jaħdmu? Jew huma politiki bħal dawn motivati bil-biża'? Minkejja l-moviment dejjem aktar mifrux favur l-Att dwar id-DRAM u l-liġijiet tal-istat (ara dan il-post preċedenti) biex l-istudenti jkunu jistgħu jħallsu t-tagħlim fl-istat, jidher li huwa l-poter tal-biża' qed jikber.<br/><br/>Huwa interessanti li l-Massa. Gov. Romane qed jixaqleb l-immigranti mingħajr dokumenti issa - dan l-artikolu fl-Ekonomista juri kif il-kampanja tiegħu biex jintemm iż-żwieġ gay fil-Massa hija marbuta mill-qrib mal-mogħdija mistennija tiegħu għall-presidenza fl-2008. Hawn fi New York, preżunt Front Demokratiku Hillary Clinton marret għad-dritt tal-immigrazzjoni, fejn talbet li hija "b'mod anonimu kontra l-immigranti illegali." Huwa sfortunat li l-mod kif timxi 'l quddiem fil-politika (b'mod partikolari fl-istati ħomor) huwa li nwaħħlu l-immigranti għall-problemi tagħna. Se jkun interessanti li naraw jekk bidla akbar tal-Latin f'postijiet bħall-Lbiċ se tkun ħażina.<br/><br/>3 kummenti:<br/><br/>Forsi n-nies ma jridux aljeni illegali jiksbu boroż ta' studju għar-raġunijiet li ġejjin:<br/><br/>1. Il-ġenituri tagħhom kissru l-liġi biex jidħlu fil-pajjiż. 2. Il-ġenituri tagħhom kellhom jisirqu l-identità ta' xi ħadd biex jaħdmu f'dan il-pajjiż. 3. Il-ġenituri tagħhom għandhom iqarrqu dwar it-taxxi tad-dħul tagħhom (u taxxi oħra) biex jibqgħu hawn. 4. Il-ġenituri tagħhom kellhom ikunu jistgħu jiksbu t-tfal tagħhom ammessi. 5. ġenituri tagħhom kienu fuq applikazzjonijiet għal affarijiet bħal ikla bla ħlas.<br/><br/>Minn naħa, il-Qorti Suprema ddeċidiet li t-tfal kollha għandhom id-dritt għall-edukazzjoni pubblika irrispettivament mill-istatus ta' immigrazzjoni. L-iskejjel huma pprojbiti milli jitolbu dwar l-istatus ta' immigrazzjoni tat-tfal, u dan ifisser li l-ġenituri bla dokumentati m'għandhomx għalfejn "jilħqu" biex jiksbu t-tfal tagħhom mingħajr ħlas.<br/><br/>It-tieni nett, ħafna immigranti m'għandhomx għalfejn jużaw identità jew cheat ieħor fuq it-taxxi tad-dħul sabiex jaħdmu hawn - ħafna min iħaddem b'mod konxju l-immigranti mhux dokumentati (dan kien qed jiġri għal xi żmien - l 1986 Imm. L-Att dwar ir-Riforma u l-Kontroll tal-Parlament jipprova jittrattah, u bosta avukati kontra l-immigranti jargumentaw li s-sanzjonijiet li min iħaddem jeħtieġ li jissaħħu llum) u ftit immigranti jħallsu t-taxxi fuq id-dħul u taxxi oħra li qatt ma jispiċċaw jirċievu l-benefiċċji tagħhom (il-New York Times rrapportaw li l-immigranti illegali jipprovdu sigurtà soċjali b'sussidju ta' $ 7 biljun fis-sena).<br/><br/>Fl-aħħar nett, jekk l-akbar problema b'immigranti mhux dokumentati tkun li qed jinkisru l-liġi billi hawnhekk, għandu jiġi applikat dak l-istess standard għan-negozji li b'mod konxju jimpjegawhom (li, bil-mod, huwa wkoll kontra l-liġi anke jekk rarament jiġi infurzat)? Jekk it-tfal ta' dawn in-negozji jiġu miċħuda l-istess opportunitajiet għaliex il-ġenituri tagħhom kissru l-liġi?Nistgħu nestendu dan l-argument lit-tfal ta' kull min qatt qasmet il-liġi f'dan il-pajjiż?<br/><br/>Tkun xi tkun taħseb dwar l-immigrazzjoni illegali, il-punt huwa li t-tfal m'għandhomx jiġu kkastigati għad-deċiżjonijiet tal-ġenituri tagħhom li jiġu hawn. Speċjalment meta dawn l-istudenti mhux dokumentati bright u hardworking għandhom il-potenzjal li jikkontribwixxu tant għas-soċjetà tagħna. |

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U.

He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay. There will be a violent, bloody backlash the likes of which has only been seen in France, but eventually will come home to roost here.<br/><br/>Communists have long been in the business of fomenting class war along economic lines and brackets. Try to think more in terms of the Constitutionalist Class than the "middle class" as their linguists prefer. Works better, imo, to throw them off their gameplans.<br/><br/>what is happening now is a quickening in the realization by the Sheeple that something is seriously wrong, and that the facade and the illusion are wearing thin and falling down, revealing the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy push for more power and absolute rule.<br/><br/>as the 'middle class' or whatever you want to call it, gets increasingly decimated and destroyed, ultimately enough Sheeple will have awakened to the point where they realize it's either stand up and fight or die on all fours.<br/><br/>the system ROTHSCHILDS is collapsing in on itself, due to way too much out of control, unchecked GREED, and now, it's like a tall building going back and forth like a pendulum in an earthquake, at some point it will finally 'snap' and fall. we're in the end game, as you will, of democracy and the faux economic system that was being perpetrated upon everyone, so there's a collision with REALITY about to happen pretty soon, and it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>IF I were SCOTUS, I'd be making sure those biz jets are fueled, pilots standing by, for their final PARAGUAYAN trip to the Bush compound where they'll hide once the balloon finally goes up here.<br/><br/>but increasingly, it looks like they're pushing hard for World War III to take everyone's eyes off the mind blowing, incredible HUBRIS of their ilk.<br/><br/>a day of reckoning is indeed coming.

Sounds like Treason to me.<br/><br/>In my own idea and understanding there have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment..Great post!!<br/><br/>4 We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.

It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals?

Il-ġustizzja Anthony M. Kennedy, bil-miktub għall-maġġoranza, qalet, "Jekk l-Ewwel Emenda għandha xi forza, tipprojbixxi lill-Kungress milli jiffinanzja jew jikkastiga liċ-ċittadini, jew lill-assoċjazzjonijiet taċ-ċittadini, talli sempliċement jimpenjaw ruħhom fit-taħdit politiku." Dan l-argument tad-deċiżjoni tal-maġġoranza huwa bbażat fuq il-kunċetti li l-korporazzjonijiet huma koperti mill-istess protezzjonijiet tad-diskors bħaċ-ċittadini individwali u li d-donazzjonijiet tal-kampanja jew il-finanzjament huma l-istess bħad-diskors.<br/><br/>Il-korporazzjonijiet, madankollu, mhumiex inerenti għall-istess bħal individwi u għalhekk ma jistax ikollhom l-istess protezzjonijiet bħall-individwi. Hemm sensiela ta' liġijiet li jipproteġu l-korporazzjonijiet u l-interessi tagħhom fl-arena li għalihom huma b'definizzjoni ffurmata—jiġifieri s-suq. Il-liġijiet li jirregolaw il-korporazzjonijiet u d-drittijiet li jgawdu minnhom huma distinti mil-liġijiet u d-drittijiet tal-individwi. Korporazzjoni, pereżempju, tista' tidħol f'kuntratti bħal individwu, iżda b'differenza minn individwu, il-membri tal-korporazzjoni jistgħu jiġu protetti b'responsabbiltà limitata sabiex l-assi personali tagħhom ma jkunux involuti.<br/><br/>Jekk korporazzjoni, allura, hija entità legali distinta rregolata minn liġijiet differenti minn individwu, il-korporazzjonijiet mhumiex protetti skont l-Ewwel Emenda bl-istess mod li l-individwi jkunu protetti. Il-korporazzjonijiet, speċjalment fl-aktar antenni b'saħħithom u sinjuri tagħhom, huma ġeneralment aktar influwenti mill-biċċa l-kbira tal-individwi fl-Amerika. Ir-restrizzjonijiet fuq l-infiq korporattiv fl-elezzjonijiet li saru mill-Qorti Suprema tal-Istati Uniti kienu maħsuba biex jindirizzaw dan il-bilanċ tal-poter bejn l-individwi medji u n-negozji influwenti bla bżonn. Il-korporazzjonijiet diġà għandhom ftit modi biex jinfluwenzaw il-politika, mill-kumitati ta' azzjoni politika sal-lobbyists dwar il-Capitol Hill. Il-fotogrammi tal-Abbozz ta' Liġi tad-Drittijiet riedu jipproteġu l-vuċijiet tal-iskwadra, u mhux jwessgħu l-vuċijiet tal-elite.<br/><br/>Il-parti l-oħra tal-bini tal-Qorti Suprema għad-deċiżjoni tagħha hija li l-Ewwel Klawżola ta' diskorsi ħielsa tapplika għall-finanzjament tal-kampanja. Filwaqt li d-diskors jista' jiġi interpretat b'mod laxk bħala kwalunkwe forma ta' espressjoni, tali definizzjoni miftuħa u ambigwa toħloq problema bit-tipi kollha ta' liġijiet. Arkitett għandu viżjoni ta' bini: huwa l-arti tiegħu, l-espressjoni tiegħu stess, iżda ma jistax jinjora liġijiet lokali ta' żona li, pereżempju, jirrestrinġu l-għoli tal-bini tiegħu. Jekk hu jfittex l-istat għal ksur tad-diskors liberu tiegħu, id-dritt tiegħu għall-espressjoni? L-ekwazzjoni ta' flus bid-diskors jiftaħ ukoll il-bieb għal talbiet ludukużi mix-xemx, pereżempju, min iħaddem li joġġezzjona għal-liġijiet minimi tal-paga peress li jixtieq jesprimi li l-impjegati tiegħu huma biss jiswew li jħallsu $ 3 siegħa. Għandu jkun hemm restrizzjonijiet fuq x'jikkostitwixxi diskors biex tiġi evitata frammentazzjoni tat-terminu u interpretazzjoni liberali żżejjed tal-Ewwel Emenda.<br/><br/>Il-korporazzjoni diġà għandha s-setgħa li toħroġ dikjarazzjoni favur kandidat jew politika permezz tal-kumitati ta' azzjoni politika tagħha, u l-membri individwali ta' negozju huma mistiedna jikkontribwixxu l-flus ukoll. Madankollu, il-fatt li korporazzjoni tkun tista' tuża l-profitti vasti tagħha biex tiffinanzja direttament l-elezzjoni jew biex tneħħi kandidat jikkomprometti l-kunċett demokratiku ta' elezzjoni ħielsa u ġusta. Issa hemm rabtiet bejn il-politiċi u diversi industriji, iżda din id-deċiżjoni l-ġdida tagħmel dawn il-konnessjonijiet aktar robusti u tagħtihom fuljett ta' leġittimità. Politika ffinanzjata minn negozju issir kompletament miżmuma fl-aġenda politika tiegħu u mhux lill-votanti.<br/><br/>Huwa mhux biss l-indipendenza tal-politiċi li jieħdu sehem, iżda wkoll l-indipendenza tal-imħallfin tagħna, li huma mill-inqas mistennija li jkunu imparzjali. Ħafna stati għadhom jużaw l-elezzjonijiet biex jaħtru l-imħallfin, li jħalluhom vulnerabbli għall-influwenza tal-infiq politiku. F'diskors riċenti f'konferenza tal-iskola tal-liġi, l-eks Prim Imħallef tal-Qorti Sandra Day O'Connor inkwetat fuq l-impatt tal-finanzjament tal-kampanja korporattiva fl-elezzjonijiet ġudizzjarji, u qal li "l-kampanja ġudizzjarja tagħmel id-deċiżjoni tal-ġimgħa l-oħra fiċ-Ċittadini Uniti problema dejjem akbar għaż-żamma ta' ġudikatura indipendenti."<br/><br/>Żewġ pedamenti tad-demokrazija tagħna — elezzjonijiet ħielsa u ġudikatura indipendenti — huma mhedda mill-attività u d-deċiżjoni ta' medjazzjoni tal-Qorti Suprema. Il-każ seta' ġie deċiż b'mod aktar strett favur iċ-Ċittadini Uniti, iżda minflok, il-maġġoranza tal-ġustizzja ddeċidew li jespandu l-każ biex id-drittijiet ta' flus kbar jiġu megħluba fuq l-interess tal-poplu Amerikan. Senaturi Dick Durbin (D-IL) u Arlen Spectre (D-PA) introduċa l-elezzjonijiet Ġust issa l-aħħar Marzu. Hija tipprojbixxi kontribuzzjonijiet minn kumitati ta' azzjoni politika u tkun taqbel ma' donazzjonijiet individwali, limitati għal $ 100, fuq bażi ta' 4:1 sabiex il-finanzjament ikun iffukat fuq in-nies. Din is-sistema ilha fis-seħħ fi New York City sa mill-Att dwar il-Finanzi tal-Kampanja 1988. Il-bqija tal-pajjiż ilha mistennija li ssegwi qabel ma l-ġlieda għall-finanzjament pubbliku kienet aktar meħtieġa.<br/><br/>L-awtur huwa anzjan tal-Kulleġġ tal-Kolombja li qed jingħaqad fix-xjenza politika. Hija student prospettiv tal-liġi.<br/><br/>L-erbatax-il emenda, li kienet waħda mill-emendi ta' Rikostruzzjoni miżjuda wara l-Gwerra tal-Aggressjoni tat-Tramuntana, qatt ma ġiet irratifikata legalment mill-Istati u kkawżat aktar problemi mill-emendi l-oħra kollha ta' wara l-gwerra flimkien. Jekk il-memorja tiegħi sservini tajjeb, il-korporazzjonijiet ġew iddikjarati mill-Qorti Suprema li huma ċittadini ta' 14-il Emenda matul l-aħħar 1800s jew is-1900 kmieni. F'każ li ma tkunx familjari mal-kliem ta' din l-emenda, hija bażikament għamlet lil kulħadd (u soġġetta) tal-Istati Uniti. Qabel il-Gwerra, l-individwi kollha kienu ċittadini ta' l-Istat li fih kienu jirrisjedu u l-ebda wieħed ma kien ċittadin ta' l-Istati Uniti u lanqas ma kienu soġġetti għall-ġurisdizzjoni ta' l-Istati Uniti ħlief għal dawk li kienu jirrisjedu fid-Distrett tal-Kolombja jew li kienu residenti f'wieħed mit-territorji taħt il-ġurisdizzjoni ta' l-Istati Uniti. L-għanijiet ewlenin tal-Gwerra tal-Aggressjoni tat-Tramuntana kellhom jeqirdu s-sovranità tal-Istati individwali u jnaqqsu l-istatus ta' kull Amerikana għal dak tas-suġġett taħt il-kontroll u l-ġurisdizzjoni tal-gvern tal-Istati Uniti. Il-fundaturi ifissed lill-gvern tagħna bħala Konfederazzjoni tajba tal-Istati Sovrana mal-Istati li jeżerċitaw il-poter politiku kollu li hu sinifikanti, u qatt ma kellhom l-intenzjoni li jgħixu f'Washington. L-affarijiet se jiksbu ħafna agħar sakemm in-nies jitfgħu l-ħallelin u l-flus mill-Washington u jirrestawraw il-gvern tagħna lura għal dak li darba kien.<br/><br/>Il-kelma tfisser korporazzjoni fil-liġi. Mhuwiex dak li l-korporazzjonijiet mhumiex nies, li n-nies mhumiex korporazzjonijiet.Aħna tkeċċew fl-aċċettazzjoni ta' identità korporattiva[ALL CAPS]. Kull darba li jmorru l-qorti, aħna jmorru bħala korporazzjoni, mhux bħala persuna naturali.L-ewwel korporazzjonijiet kienu l-gvernijiet. Ħarsa lejn il-loġika, ir-responsabbiltà limitata għal korporazzjoni hija l-estensjoni tal-immunità sovrana għar-re wara li m'għadhiex re. L-istess deċiżjoni, il-familji elite għadhom fil-kontroll u li tmur it-triq kollha lura għall-ewwel magħrufa dwar extraterrestris[anunaki] li d-dokumenti Sajf jitkellmu dwarhom. L-istess grupp jieħu wkoll il-kreditu jew il-ħtija għar-reliġjonijiet u s-soċjetajiet sigrieti kollha.<br/><br/>X'differenza tagħmel? Realy. Aħseb dwar dan, il-Kungress kollu u s-Senat huma kelb u juru l-poni, il-sensara setgħa reali li jikkontrollaw dan kollu huma fil-shadows, jaħdmu l-ftehim, jagħmlu dak li jixtiequ, bl-AL-CIA-DA u l-MOSSAD hemmhekk qtil kulħadd li ma jaqbilx ma' dawn l-a assholes tal-gvern dell li verament imexxu dan kollu.<br/><br/>Allura, għaliex huwa tant importanti issa li tkun tant taqlib fuq din il-shit? Għaliex issa? Wara aktar minn mitt sena ta' prova assoluta li l-politiċi huma biss popuped idejn fancy juru li juru lilna distracting mill-ROOMS REALI, għaliex issa huwa importanti li d-disprezzament totali tad-demokrazija huwa muri mill-SCOTUS f'din id-deċiżjoni? L-assholes fuq din il-qorti jafu li l-guys reali ma tagħhom f'idejn il-lievi tal-qawwa tas-sistema mhumiex fil-Kungress u s-Senat.<br/><br/>Meta l-Istat tad-Dritt sar l-OBSOLET fid-dinja, b'mod ġenerali, u kollox sar aktar jew inqas ROLELLA biss dan iż-żmien, fuq l-STEROIS, u mill-CORORATIONs, għaliex din id-deċiżjoni biss għamlet dik id-differenza kollha? Għaliex tagħmel dak kollu li inti assholes taħseb li dan l-indikatur "lagging" ta' l-aħħar ta' kull ċaqlieq tal-gvern demokratiku jagħmel xi differenza.<br/><br/>Ipotetikament, ejja ngħidu li din id-deċiżjoni ma seħħx., Kwalunkwe wieħed minnkom jaħsbu li l-korporazzjonijiet u l-influwenzi tal-flus fid-dellijiet ma kinux se jkomplu jeżerċitaw kwalunkwe u r-rieda tagħhom fuq il-bqija ta'l-istati uniti?<br/><br/>Għal dawk minnkom li jaħsbu li kien differenti, nissuġġerixxi ssib rimedju għan-NAVETI TOTAL tiegħek!!!<br/><br/>din id-deċiżjoni ma kinitx tagħmel oita waħda ta' differenza.

Qatt ma kellna xi kontroll, qatt. tagħmel din il-muntanji mill-għoljiet moletiċi assolutament mhux mixtieqa, fid-dawl tal-fatt li għall-istorja kollha ta' 230 sena ta' din ir-repubblika, il-qtates tax-xaħam u l-oligarki sinjuri qatt m'għandhom bżonn xi Kungress jew Senat biex jagħmlu dak li għaddew, taħt xi ċirkostanzi, qatt qabel.

Il-libertà li wieħed jiddisponi mill-ġid tiegħu, kif jidher tajjeb tiġi flimkien mal-libertà li jaqla'h. Jekk l-aggregat ta' individwi jkun kiseb flus, għandu jkun liberu li jiġi deċiż kif wieħed jiddisponi minn dak il-flus. Il-problema reali mhix li n-negozji jistgħu jagħtu lill-kampanji, huwa li l-gvern ġie permess li jarmaw fin-negozju – jiġifieri li l-gvern jista' jagħti xi favur għal dak il-flus.

| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Sommarju interpretattiv: Dan il-kapitlu tal-ktieb jirrevedi aspetti varji ta' dak li hu meħtieġ għall-għażla ta' kunjardi mudell biex iwieġbu mistoqsijiet pertinenti għax-xjenza tal-ħaxix ħażin. Speċifikament, il-kapitolu jkopri għaliex għandna bżonn speċi ta' mudell, attributi ta' mudell, u jipprovdi l-istat attwali ta' għarfien u riżorsi li ġew żviluppati għal ftit weeds ewlenin bħall-Kirurġija festi, Milied tal-Kanada, temprum, u brożum falz vjola li jistgħu jagħmluhom mudelli potenzjali tajba.<br/><br/>Astratti Tekniċi:<br/>L-għażla ta' għadd limitat ta' kunjardi u żvilupp ta' għodod u riżorsi bbażati fuq il-ġenomika se tiffaċilita studji dwar l-ekoloġija, il-bijoloġija, il-fiżjoloġija u l-iżvilupp ta' speċijiet tal-ħaxix ħażin. Studji bħal dawn se jgħinu biex iwieġbu l-mistoqsijiet fundamentali tat-tħassib dwar ix-xjenza tal-ħaxix ħażin. Madankollu, biex jiżguraw li l-komunità tax-xjenza tal-ħaxixa tista' tutilizza b'mod xieraq u sħiħ dawn il-ħaxix tal-mudell, jeħtieġ li jiġu magħżula bir-reqqa. Għandhom jiġu kkunsidrati diversi attributi bħall-faċilità tal-istudju, il-karatteristiċi tal-ħaxix ħażin, u l-importanza bħala speċi ta' weedy. Barra minn hekk, id-disponibbiltà tar-riżorsi ekonomiċi eżistenti tista' tintuża biex tiġi estiża l-lista tal-ħaxix ħażin. Ġew żviluppati wkoll diversi riżorsi speċifikament għall-ħaxix ħażin bħall-ġbir tal-weraq, il-Kanada, il-laħam tan-nagħaġ, u l-vjola l-falsija. |
