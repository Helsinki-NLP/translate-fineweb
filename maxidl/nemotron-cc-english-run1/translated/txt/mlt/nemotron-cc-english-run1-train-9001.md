| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Pereżempju, l-Artikolu VI, il-Klawsola 2 tal-Kostituzzjoni Amerikana għandha d-dispożizzjonijiet li "it-trattati kollha [...] għandhom ikunu l-liġi suprema tal-Land." Għalkemm huwa evidenti li t-trattati waħedhom m'għandhomx l-istess effett bħal-liġijiet federali. Fil-verità, huma biss isiru operazzjonali ladarba dawn id-dispożizzjonijiet jidħlu fis-seħħ bħala liġi Federali bis-Senat u l-approvazzjoni President. Għalkemm din hija l-prattika, huwa prinċipju ġeneralment aċċettat fid-dritt internazzjonali li ċerti trattati għandhom effett vinkolanti fuq il-pajjiżi. It-trattat għandu jissodisfa r-rekwiżit li trattat ta' awto-eżekuzzjoni jaffettwa lill-pajjiż mingħajr ebda leġiżlatura domestika korrispondenti direttament.<br/><br/>Dan iqajjem il-kwistjoni dwar liema trattat se jikkwalifika bħala “awto-eżekuzzjoni” u li ma jkunx?<br/><br/>Jekk trattat huwiex trattat li jirregola lilu nnifsu jew le jiġi deċiż mill-imħallfin nazzjonali fuq bażi ta' każ għal każ (Buergenthal, 1992). Sabiex wieħed jifhem dan, id-dokument l-ewwel se jħares lejn iż-żewġ tipi ta' teoriji segwiti minn pajjiżi dwar in-natura ta' trattati li japplikaw għal-liġi domestika. Dawn iż-żewġ teoriji huma monomżi u doppji. Huma jqisu b'mod bażiku l-qafas tad-dritt domestiku u internazzjonali bħala ġerarkija waħda u żewġ ġerarkija separata, rispettivament (Widhaber, 1971). Il-pajjiżi wara l-miżmu jemmnu li ċerti trattati huma vinkolanti immedjatament u immedjatament għandhom effett fuq il-pajjiż. Ladarba t-trattat ikun ġie ratifikat, dan jista' jiġi invokat fil-qrati nazzjonali u jitqies bħala parti mil-liġi tal-pajjiż. Il-pajjiżi wara d-duiżmu jemmnu li trattat ma jaffettwax il-liġi domestika sakemm ikun ġie msaħħaħ minn leġiżlatur li jkun għadda fil-parlament. Eżempju ta' djalogu huwa kif il-Konvenzjoni Ewropea dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Bniedem saret operattiva fir-Renju Unit wara li għadda l-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Bniedem 1998 fil-parlament tagħhom (Liġijiet, 2000).<br/><br/>Id-dritt internazzjonali huwa divers, u għalhekk huma t-tipi ta' proċeduri differenti jsegwu għall-aċċettazzjoni tat-trattati. Xi kostituzzjonijiet jsemmu huma stess il-proċeduri għar-ratifika ta' trattat. Ċerti organizzazzjonijiet internazzjonali bħall-Unjoni Ewropea spiss jaffettwaw il-liġi domestika tal-istati membri tagħha. L-istati membri tal-Unjoni Ewropea għandhom jagħtu effett lil ċerti forom ta' leġiżlatur komunitarju, għalkemm għandu differenza essenzjali mit-trattati ta' awto-eżekuzzjoni. Id-differenza hija li l-imħallfin nazzjonali ma għandhomx jiddeċiedu jekk id-dispożizzjonijiet humiex awto-eżekuzzjoni jew le, iżda pjuttost il-Qorti tal-Ġustizzja Ewropea biex jinterpretaw skont it-trattati kostituzzjonali tagħha. Forom oħra ta' liġi internazzjonali ffurmati permezz ta' riżoluzzjonijiet jew tali li jista' jkollhom l-istess effett għal dawn l-istati. Madankollu, huma jistgħu jikkunsidrawhom bħala forom ta' "liġi ratba" u jfittxuhom biex jinterpretaw l-intenzjoni tal-liġi. Xi kultant, il-proklamazzjonijiet magħmula mill-organi ġudizzjarji ta' organizzazzjonijiet internazzjonali bħall-Qorti Inter-Amerikana tad-Drittijiet tal-Bniedem jaffettwaw l-istati membri tagħhom. Għalkemm dawn il-proklamazzjonijiet mhumiex vinkolanti fuq l-istati membri, l-imħallfin nazzjonali jidhru li jirreferu għal dawn għall-interpretazzjoni awtorevoli.<br/><br/>Għalhekk, għandu jittieħed approċċ każ għal każ filwaqt li jiġu analizzati l-proċeduri u l-preċedenti stabbiliti f'pajjiżi differenti. Biex jiġi eżaminat il-kunċett ta' trattati li jeżegwixxu lilhom infushom, dan id-dokument jipparaguna l-preċedenti stabbiliti minn ġurisdizzjonijiet differenti. Jekk il-qarrej jixtieq jagħmel analiżi simili, jista' jagħmel dan billi jħares lejn il-kotba nazzjonali differenti dwar id-dritt internazzjonali. Ħafna drabi, dawn is-snin se jkollhom taqsima ddedikata għar-relazzjoni bejn il-liġi internazzjonali u dik nazzjonali.<br/><br/>Il-Ġuriżdizzjoni Internazzjonali:<br/><br/>L-aktar kwistjoni sinifikanti li tiġi f'idejn il-qrati nazzjonali hija jekk it-trattat huwiex awto-eżekuzzjoni?Jekk it-trattat ikun jista' jiġi applikat mingħajr ebda leġiżlatur nazzjonali addizzjonali li jkun għadda biex isaħħaħha. Din il-kwistjoni ġiet ippreżentata fil-każ ta' Czesław S. vs State Treasury u l-Ministru tat-Teżor tal-Istat, fejn il-Qorti Kostituzzjonali Pollakka qieset li peress li d-dispożizzjonijiet tat-trattat li għandhom jittieħdu miżuri domestiċi, it-trattat ma kienx awto-eżekuzzjoni tan-natura tiegħu (Bug xmara pretensjonijiet, Czesław S vs It-Teżor tal-Istat u l-Ministru tat-Teżor tal-Istat, 2003). Essenzjalment, meta t-trattat jirreferi għal miżuri domestiċi li għandhom jittieħdu, fih innifsu ma joħloqx obbligi ġodda, iżda jsaħħaħ l-intenzjoni tat-trattat għall-proċess legali domestiku li jieħu miżuri għall-istess. F'dan il-każ, il-qorti qieset jekk il-Patt Internazzjonali dwar id-Drittijiet Ċivili u Politiċi kienx trattat ta' awtoeżekuzzjoni. Il-Qorti Suprema Amerikana ddikjarat ukoll li l-Patt Internazzjonali dwar id-Drittijiet Ċivili u Politiċi mhuwiex trattat awtonomu (il-Qorti tal-Ġustizzja, 2004). Il-Qorti Suprema Federali tal-Iżvizzera eżaminat ukoll in-natura ta' awtoeżekuzzjoni tal-Patt Internazzjonali dwar id-Drittijiet Ċivili u Politiċi. Il-kwistjoni quddiem il-qorti kienet jekk l-Artikolu 13(2)(b) u (c) kinitx ta' natura awtoeżekuzzjoni. Il-qorti eżaminat jekk it-trattat kienx parzjalment awtoeżekuzzjoni u kienx għamel dan billi vverifikat jekk kienx jeżisti kontenut minimu ta' qalba sabiex it-trattat ikun applikabbli. Il-qorti kkonstatat li hija ma kkonstatat ebda tali dispożizzjoni fit-trattat (A u B vs Il-Gvern tal-Kanton ta' Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>Huwa essenzjali li wieħed jifhem li dawn il-kwistjonijiet huma differenti mill-kwistjoni fundamentali ta' jekk id-dritt internazzjonali jistax jiġi applikat bħala parti mil-liġi tal-art? Sabiex tingħata risposta għal din id-domanda, id-dokument se jeżamina s-sentenza mill-Qorti Suprema tar-Repubblika Dominikana. Il-Qorti Suprema ddikjarat li l-Artikolu 3 tal-Kostituzzjoni tar-Repubblika Dominikana għamel il-liġi internazzjonali vinkolanti fuq is-sistema legali domestika. Il-qorti ċaħdet l-interpretazzjoni tal-Qorti Superjuri tal-Land li dawn it-trattati kienu “leġiżlatur barrani” u mhux parti mill-ordinament ġuridiku intern. Il-Qorti Suprema stabbiliet li t-trattati kollha ratifikati mir-Repubblika Dominikana jiffurmaw parti mil-Liġi Dominikana u, għalhekk, jistgħu jitqiesu bħala awto-eżekuzzjoni (Galarddo Montilla vs Galardo Concepión u ors, 1997). Il-Qorti Suprema Federali tal-Iżvizzera eżaminat jekk it-Trattat ta' Lisbona kienx awto-eżekuzzjoni u direttament applikabbli għall-Universitajiet Svizzeri. Skont il-ġurisprudenza rilevanti, norma ta' trattat hija direttament applikabbli jekk il-kontenut tiegħu jkun preċiż biżżejjed u ċar li jifforma l-bażi ta' deċiżjoni f'każ partikolari. In-norma għalhekk għandha tkun iġġustifikata, jiġifieri tiddefinixxi d-drittijiet u l-obbligi ta' individwu u tkun diretta lejn l-awtoritajiet kompetenti” (X vs L-Università ta' Lucerne, 2014). Dan jimplika li jekk it-trattat huwiex direttament applikabbli jew le, jiddependi fuq jekk in-norma hijiex ġustifikabbli. It-Trattat ta' Lisbona huwiex ibbażat fuq il-prinċipju ta' kwalifiki miksuba abbord. Dan iseħħ permezz tal-Artikolu IV (1) tat-Trattat. L-għan ta' dan kien li jinħoloq obbligu għall-istati li juru li l-proċess tat-teħid tad-deċiżjonijiet tagħhom huwa ġust, trasparenti u mhux diskriminatorju. Ir-responsabbiltà għall-prova li l-applikant ma jkunx issodisfa l-kriterji meħtieġa hija dwar il-"korp li jwettaq il-valutazzjoni." It-Trattat jiggarantixxi s-salvagwardji proċedurali, li huma ġeneralment aċċettati mill-pajjiżi u għalhekk, il-qorti ddeċidiet li dan it-trattat huwa awto-eżekuzzjoni. Dan ikompli juri l-interpretazzjonijiet differenti meħuda mill-qrati ta' diversi pajjiżi.<br/><br/>Huwa essenzjali li jiġi osservat jekk in-normi stabbiliti mit-trattati humiex fil-fatt qed jiġu osservati, il-ġurisprudenza li tirriżulta minn diversi ġurisdizzjonijiet enfasizzati li l-qrati nazzjonali huma l-awtorità finali dwar il-kwistjoni ta' jekk trattat huwiex eżerċitat lilu nnifsu. Hemm ukoll kwistjoni ta' dazju inerenti fuq il-pajjiżi għall-osservanza u l-eżekuzzjoni xierqa tat-trattati. Din hija mitfugħa mir-regola tal-Patta Sunt Svalbard kif stabbilita fl-Artikolu 26 tal-Konvenzjoni ta' Vjenna dwar il-Liġi tat-Trattati (VCLT). L-Artikolu 27 ikompli jsaħħaħh billi jiddikjara li l-obbligi tal-liġi internazzjonali ma jistgħux jiġu injorati bl-użu tal-liġi domestika bħala ġustifikazzjoni. Il-qrati ta' ħafna pajjiżi użaw dan bħala sors ta' interpretazzjoni, bħall-Qorti Kostituzzjonali Latvjana. Fil-każ ta' norma nazzjonali li tmur kontra regola internazzjonali, il-qorti qieset li n-norma nazzjonali kienet nulla u bla effett. Sabiex tasal għall-konklużjoni tagħha, il-qorti bbażat ruħha b'mod qawwi fuq il-prestazzjoni neċessarja tat-trattati b'bona fide kif previst fl-Artikolu 26 tal-VCLT (Linija vs Il-Latvja, 2004).<br/><br/>Konklużjoni:<br/><br/>Minn dan ta' hawn fuq, huwa ċar li t-trattati għandhom rekwiżiti partikolari qabel ma jkunu jistgħu jitqiesu li huma awto-eżekuzzjoni tagħhom, iżda, filwaqt li jżommu dawn l-effetti kollha, l-aktar importanti tibqa' l-interpretazzjoni tal-qrati nazzjonali. Il-qrati nazzjonali jiddeċiedu jekk it-trattat jistax jissejjaħ awtoeżekuzzjoni jew le. Għalkemm il-Kostituzzjoni tagħhom tista' tinkludi dispożizzjoni dwar it-trattat li l-liġi suprema tal-art, il-qrati minn pajjiżi differenti jinterpretaw dawn id-dispożizzjonijiet b'modi differenti. Dan jista' jitqies bħala kif it-tnejn li huma Kostituzzjonijiet Amerikani u Dominikana fihom dawn id-dispożizzjonijiet iżda jsegwu interpretazzjonijiet kompletament differenti tal-istess. It-terminu "awto-eżekuzzjoni" ma jistax ikun kongruvjali għal dawn it-trattati peress li, fil-prattika, xorta jeħtieġu approvazzjoni mill-qrati nazzjonali. Idealment, it-triq 'il quddiem għandha tkun li l-pajjiżi jirrikonoxxu n-natura awto-eżekuzzjoni tat-trattati u jittrattawhom b'mod li fih l-Artikolu 26 u 27 tal-VCT huma rispettati. Għal darb'oħra, din hija s-sitwazzjoni "ideali" u mhux probabbli li ssibha fil-prattika statali ta' ċerti ġurisdizzjonijiet f'kull ħin. Xorta waħda, it-tama tista' tinkiseb billi wieħed iħares lejn l-interpretazzjonijiet tal-qrati nazzjonali li jirrispettaw dawn in-normi u b'qalb tajba twitti t-triq għall-qrati l-oħra biex jirrikonoxxu dan.<br/><br/>Referenzi:<br/><br/>It-Trattati ta' l-UE għall-Infurzar tal-Liġi Nazzjonali u Internazzjonali (Vol. 303). 235 POLITIKA TA' ACADEMJA TAL-ĠU LING, p.<br/><br/>Wildhaber, L.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years.

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Iċċekkja l-ġbir tagħna ta' blogs miktuba minn membri tal-persunal sħab.<br/><br/>Blokki ta' informazzjoni<br/><br/>M'għandekx istress Huwa<br/><br/>billi<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, irrispettivament minn kif affarijiet kbar huma li jmorru, jistgħu dejjem issib mod biex rear kap gly., Jekk hija talba xogħol aħħar minuta jew karta li inti mitluf li jiktbu u huwa dovut l-jum li jmiss, stress jistgħu dejjem issib mod fil-jum tiegħek jekk inti tippermetti dan. Illum ser nurik ftit affarijiet li tista' tagħmel biex telimina jew tipprevjeni l-istress.<br/><br/>L-ewwel ħaġa li tista tagħmel huwa li jeżerċitaw.L-eżerċizzju huwa mod tajjeb ħafna biex ittaffi l-istress minħabba li jnaqqas l-ormoni stress fil-ġisem tiegħek magħrufa bħala kortisol.Il-livelli aktar baxxi ta' cortisol fil-ġisem tiegħek, il-livell ta' l-istress aktar baxx tiegħek se jkun. Eżerċizzju jistgħu wkoll iżidu l-kunfidenza tiegħek, u meta l-fiduċja tiegħek tkun sa allura l-istress tiegħek normalment jiġi 'l isfel. Għalija, meta nikseb enfasizzat, I dejjem jeżerċitaw billi tmur għand il-gym u l-prattika boxing, dan jgħinni burn kaloriji u jnaqqsu l-istress filwaqt li gost.<br/><br/>L-affarijiet tal-kitba ġew mod biex jikkalkolaw lin-nies 'l isfel għal żmien twil ħafna, u huwa s-suġġett li jmiss fuq il-lista tagħna. Għandi esperjenza simili meta nikteb l-istejjer, normalment jekk ma nistax naħseb ta' idea ġdida minħabba waħda antika, se nikteb l-idea l-qadima u naħseb dwarha.Din hija meta bdew l-ideat l-ġodda biex infirxu u nista' nkomplu nikteb normalment. Huwa l-istess mal-istress. Aħseb dwar fluss li jkompli jdawwru huwa mogħdija sakemm jolqot a da beaver, u li dam jimblokka l-fluss ta' l-ilma u kollox jibda jibni.L-uniku mod biex tikseb il-fluss ta' l-ilma lura għan-normal huwa li tneħħi l-ħsara. Dan huwa fejn il-kitba tidħol.Meta tikteb li isfel, inti qed tneħħi l-istress biċċa b'biċċa sakemm tista' taħseb normalment.<br/><br/>L-istress jista' jidħol fil-ħajja tagħna permezz tal-bibien fil-ħajja tagħna li nżommu miftuħa.Il-Prostrazzjoni hija mod kif nistgħu nħallu l-bibien jinfetħu għall-istress. Stennija sakemm għada jistgħu jkunu divertenti għall-lum, iżda se iweġġgħu inti għada, u hija soluzzjoni tant qasira. Iktar ma tistenna li tagħmel xi ħaġa, iktar tkun kbira li xi ħaġa ssir, u iktar ikun kbir li ssir aktar stress li tkun qed tistieden f'ħajtek. Meta tieħu ħsieb xi ħaġa hekk kif nirċievu huwa mod tajjeb ħafna biex tipprevjeni l-istress, iżda huwa xi ħaġa li tieħu dixxiplina kbira biex tagħmel., Aktar inti maqtugħa Prostrazzjoni mill-ħajja tiegħek, l-istress aktar ħielsa inti se tkun. Hekk shut dak il-bieb, int kiri l-arja kiesħa kollha barra.<br/><br/>Mela ejja tirrevedi: Eżerċizzju, Ikteb x'inhu stressanti għalik, u M'għandekx Prostrainate. Dawn huma biss ftit modi biex ittaffi l-istress iżda lili, huma l-aktar effettivi. Filwaqt li naf li dawn jistgħu ma jaħdmux għal kulħadd, nixtieq nistedin lil kull min iħossu jisħaq fuq ir-riċerka kif jista' jeħles minnu. |
