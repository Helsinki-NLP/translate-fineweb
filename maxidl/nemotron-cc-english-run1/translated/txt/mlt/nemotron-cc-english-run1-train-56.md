| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Filwaqt li jirrikonoxxi li huwa impossibbli li wieħed jargumentaw dwar xi ħaġa li tħobbhom mibegħda, u viċe versa, huwa għadu ta' spiss pjaċevoli li jipprova l-argument.

Kif jista' jkun li ma tistax tixtri krank tal-qadima stimolat li taqsam l-affarijiet meta tkun irrabjat, iżda tista' tixtri orfni li tgħix ġewwa arloġġ tal-istazzjon tal-ferrovija tal-ġgant u tibda tuża vjaġġ spirituż biex tissewwa l-awtomazzjoni biex temmen li jista' jkun li hemm sigrieti minn missieru mejtin, iżda li minflok iwassalh għal vjaġġ ta' teżor ta' skoperta personali, fl-art maġika taċ-ċinema? Qatt ma sibt id-disinn tar-rokokju tal-iggwidat ta' Hugo, il-ġbir aggressiv tal-qalb, jew it-tagħbija tal-quirk anke ftit eċċessiv jew diffiċli biex tibla'?<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet u Luhrmann bħala influwenzi fuq Scorse?! Insejt li huma indelicate, issa int deliberatament poking me ma' stick jaqtgħu. Jekk qed tfittex ispirazzjoni għal Hugo—indebitt, jekk qed tfittex il-qalba emozzjonali ta' Hugo—int trid tmur lura għat-tfulija ta' Esplora fuq it-Triq ta' Eliżabetta fi ftit l-Italja, fejn boy ftit asthmatic, li ma jistax jilgħab barra mit-tfal l-oħra, għajjien li Alexander Korda fantasiji bħal Thehief Of Bagdad. Jew, b'mod aktar sempliċi, biss mur dritt għall-sors innifsu: George Méliès, li l-vjaġġ tiegħu lejn il-Qamar jibqa 'l-Big Bang tal-fantasiji ċinematiku kollha, dak il-mument meta l-kamera ma kienx użat biex jiddokumenta d-dinja kif inhi, imma tkun xi tkun whimsika, maġika, trasport post filmmaker trid tivvintah. U dik it-tradizzjoni ġiet żviluppata u estiża għal għexieren ta' snin qabel ma l-likes ta' Ġeunet u Luhrmann ħadu ftit paws fuqhom.<br/><br/>U t-tentattiv sabiħ li nieħu l-arma retrika tiegħi, iżda jien se ngħidlek: Kif tista' tħobb lil Amélie, imma ssib Hugo sintetiċi u "eċċessi" u "bla ħsieb il-manipulazzjoni"? Inti tgħid li Amélie u Moulin Rouge għandhom rededing "sens ta' [tagħhom] stess redikoli" fejn Scorese tfisser li nieħdu Hugo serjament, u ma naħsibx li l-każ, mill-inqas fuq dan tal-aħħar. Li Scorese tħoss passjoni evidenti dwar il-films huwa, I suppost, għaliex int ma interpretazzjoni Hugo bħala self-serju. Imma jien, dawk is-sentimenti li jagħtu l-film tas-saborra emozzjonali li l-films Luhrmann u Jeuneet m'għandhomx. It-tliet films jagħmlu użu aggressiv tat-tqim tas-CIG—u s-Scorese żżid 3D mat-taħlita, b'effett mill-isbaħ—imma fejn inti u jien differenti huwa dwar il-kwistjoni tal-piż. Naqbel li s-CIG għandu effett differenti; id-dinja magħmula kompletament mill-plastikina diġitali hija flessibbli għall-punt fejn xi drabi m'għandhom l-ebda preżenza. Int irreferejt għal Hugo fid-dħul "Overated" tiegħek għall-biċċa aħjar tal-Film tagħna bħala "Gimcrack" — dis. perfetta għall-film ieħor.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Huwa ġust li wieħed jgħid li Scorese bniet Hugo madwar il-ħruġ standard, "qalb-plucking" tat-tfal ktieb/movie plot: Orfni jitlef tiegħu daddy, joħloq dinja fantasija ftit tiegħu stess, gloms fuq ħabib ġdid, jikkonvinċi studud qodma krusta li soften u forsi jadottaw lilu. Iżda li huwa biss l-iskeletru narrattiva, u Scorse jipprovdi ħafna laħam u demm. Għal waħda, ma tistax tara Hugo, l-tifel waħdu, li jgħaddi minn torrijiet ta' l-arloġġ għall-istazzjon tal-ferrovija ta' Pariġi mingħajr ħsieb ta' l-Scorsese, tifel ieħor waħdu, li jibda mill-tieqa tas-sodda tiegħu fuq Triq Eliżabetta. U anke jekk int ma kbira biżżejjed film nerd li jagħmel dik il-konnessjoni, I verament jħossu bħall-vjaġġ ta' Hugo ma jkunx qed isib figura l-ġdida tal-missier, iżda li jippersistu mal-magic mekkaniku li stands bħala l-legat ta'missier tiegħu stess. Dan huwa dak il-film: Il-persistenza tal-viżjoni li tippermettilna naċċettaw verżjoni illustrata tad-dinja f'24 frejms kull sekonda hija x-xjenza u magic f'daqqa. Ir-relazzjoni ta' Hugo mal-Méliès mhuwiex dwar lilu komdu sa daddy ġdid, iżda l-qsim ta'entużjażmu komuni li l-bniedem qadim għandu fl-urbanità.Biex me, dan huwa angolu ferm aktar uniku fuq bini potenzjalment ħanut.<br/><br/>Qatt ma sibt verament l-ebda qerq taʼ Hugo? Anki ftit id- detetturi tal- film jidhru li lesti li jammettu li s- sekwenzi li jevokaw l- istorja taċ- ċinema u l- studio taʼ Méliès—bil- studju tal- films eroj!—kienu terrific. Din ħass, bl-aħjar mod possibbli, bħal kompressjoni bil-quddiem tal-klassi storja tiegħi ta' Film 101 fil-kulleġġ, kondensazzjoni s-serem ta' klipps u l-kuntest f'xi ħaġa bejn montage u l-ktieb pop-up animati. U jitkellem mad-disinn ingenious tal-film, li saffi fatt u fantasija hekk beautifully li huwa f'darba storja ta' Méliès u t-twelid taċ-ċinema, u biss l-tip ta' sempliċi, ippronunzjata ċinema wonder li Scorse lilu nnifsu kien iħobb bħala tifel. Grazzi tal-goodness Hugo ma jsegwux il-mudell Juneet/Luhrmann u għandhom "sens ta' redikoluness tiegħu stess." Bħala connoisseur fantasy inti stess, ma tistax tgħid li hemm il-valur fil-logħob dritta u l-earest u unbaseded aktar milli jaħdmu fl-udjenza?, Inti tista'ssib Hugo marid ħelu, iżda ma naħsibx li l-awtentiċità tal-sentiment tiegħu għandu jiġi miċħud.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Tasha: Iva, fil-fatt sibt partijiet ta'Hugo enchanting. (Avviż dwar kif jien twieġeb il-mistoqsija tiegħek sa quddiem, filwaqt li inti kienu wisq okkupat fraternità bl-applossi biex tindirizza l-minjiera, għalkemm I tassumi li tweġiba għaliha stess id-dritt. Okay, "influwenza" tista' tkun sopravaluta l-każ—Nfisser kemm l-istil viżiv ħares familjari ħafna. Minkejja li Keith qallek meta għamilt dan personalment, is-Scorse la huwa kontra t-tpinġija minn viżwali ta' ħaddieħor, u lanqas immuni għalih.) Primarjament, kont imsaħħa mill-partijiet li kienu jittrattaw ma' Georges Méliès, bl-imħabba tiegħu taċ-ċinema, max-xogħol li għamel fl-arti tiegħu u l-ferħ li ħareġ minnu. Hemm a lott awful ta' sbuħija u gost fl-istadju tax-xena taħt l-ilma tal-qorti minn Méliès "Fairyland", u fis-sekwenza fl-aħħar, li jiffoka fuq il-filmat Méliès. Jien ser nagħtikom il-konnessjoni ta' Hugo ma' Méliès fuq l-imħabba maqsuma ta' film hija tmiss sbieħ. U ngawdu film tajjeb dwar il-film tal-film.<br/><br/>Iżda Hugo mhux primarjament dwar il-film, minkejja l-Méliès tie-ins., Minbarra t-temi li inti jiċċitaw, huwa wkoll dwar is-sejba ta'l-iskop tiegħek, kif il-karattri espressament, ovvjament jispjegaw lil xulxin u lilna. U huwa dwar l-ispazju, u l-biċċiet ta'azzjoni kbar, u t-truf tal-haply-ever-wara l-aħħar fejn anke l- rabja b'mod bulli u l-koppja anzjani shy u fergawadsakes anke l-chashund chunky tikseb pared off ma charming imħabba l-interessi sa l-aħħar. Huwa dwar it-tip ta' Hermione super-precious li huma ġisem u perky u clever u li jfaħħar id-dinja maġika magħluqa fil-kotba.U kollha ta' dan in-negozju huwa familjari mighty, u artifiċjali mighty.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Iva, is-Scoresse qed jilgħab ma' arkati.Il-problema hija, qatt ma ħassithom b'xi ħaġa ġdida, frisk, jew believa, minkejja l-backdoor tiegħu stess. I kien ferm preferut storja dwar skorse żgħażagħ jikbru ma asthma — xi ħaġa fuq skala żgħira u reali, mingħajr kmamar vasti sħiħa tal-lockwork CGI u deheb glowing dust-mots u l-ħolm profetiku u raging anti-guard adulti b'qalb ta 'deheb — kollha ta' dak l-antik, fuq il-quċċata nonsense. Inti żżomm tikklikkja l-isfond personali ta' Scorse u l-imħabba tal-film bħala evidenza li huwa verament tħoss dak li qed ipoġġi fuq l-iskrin, iżda ma tħossx l-mess personali tiegħu fi kwalunkwe wieħed minn dan, ħlief il-mumenti li huma espressament dwar il-film. L-emozzjonijiet ewlenin jistgħu jkunu reali, iżda li ma jagħmlux l-eżekuzzjoni inqas falza.<br/><br/>Inti tgħid l-awtentiċità ta' l-emozzjoni mhix li tiġi miċħuda. M'għandix dubju jekk Scorese personalment ħassejtx waħdu u iżolat bħala tifel, iżda ma nħossux lis-solitudni u l-iżolament fuq l-iskrin—ara mazz taʼ affari eżaġerati (Hugo huwa filthy u l-ħwejjeġ tiegħu jintlibsu u l-adulti kollha kemm huma jkunu b'mod regolari wiehed minn kelb scary!) u taħbit kbir, b'xagħżlu u weeping u Spielbergjan li jobgħodhom. Għalija, is-sincerity hija aktar konvinċenti u aktar personali meta huwa kwieti u dirett; meta xi ħadd li jkun qed juri l-opinjonijiet tiegħu fil-pr, I jassumi li huwa jew verament rrabjata, jew sempliċement jippruvaw jegħlbu s-sensi tiegħi biex iżommuni milli tesprimi l-opinjoni tiegħi stess. Hugo kien wieħed sparatura twil, fir-rigward ta' I kien ikkonċernat.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Għaliex ma sibtx dak is-sens ta' fakery minn Amélie, inti titlob? Fil-fatt, I ma. Se nirrikonoxxu bis-sħiħ li Amélie u Molin Rouge huma t-tnejn kbar, manipulattivi, kostruzzjonijiet artifiċjali fl-istess vina eżatta, talbiet emozzjonijiet speċifiċi f'intervalli speċifiċi, u jippruvaw ibigħu dawk l-emozzjonijiet bil-mod emozzjoni qawwija u l- pronunzja tas-soundtrack aggressiva. La minnhom verament biegħli fuq emozzjonijiet tagħhom bħala sensazzjoni umana awtentika. Dak li ħadt gost f'dawn iż-żewġ films kien il-kostruzzjoni, b'mod partikolari l-kap tal-Amélie, il-listi li jistgħu jinqalgħu ta' karatteristiċi u esperjenzi ta' karatterizzazzjoni każwali għall-kast tagħha, u l-maskili tal-magpie mużikali ta' Moulin Rouge u r-rikostituzzjonijiet. Ħafna drabi inbiegħu fuq stejjer li jagħmlu affarijiet kreattivi jew ambizzjużi bi struttura, u t-tnejn ta' dawk il-films jikkwalifikaw, fejn Hugo huwa ħafna aktar lineari, standard tal-gidi-tfittxija.<br/><br/>Imma fl-aħħar nett, għalija, verament toħroġ għal sensazzjoni li dawk il-films huma egoistiċi, filwaqt li Hugo huwa maħsub li jittieħdu b'mod serju f'kull mument trattat. Inti ma taħseb li huwa minnu—iżda int fl-istess ħin tiddefendi l-integrità tagħha f'termini tal-emozzjonijiet assolutament awtentiċi, għeruq fil-Scorse-istorja, u tgħidli jien ħażin, u ma jfissirx li dan għandu jittieħed b'mod serju. Kif tirrikonċilja dawn iż-żewġ dikjarazzjonijiet? X'inhu l-film jissuġġerixxi li inti li mhuwiex maħsub li jittieħed fil-valur tal-wiċċ? U huwa possibbli li din hija sitwazzjoni kurjuża oħra ta' Benjamin Buttuna bħal fejn insib l-użu tat-tfal fil-films ta' baġit kbir biex inkun bil-kbir u b'mod melodicjat, filwaqt li bħala dad issib li bypasses ċimiżmu tiegħek u tmur dritt għall-jikkontribrixxu mal-familja tiegħek?<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Scott: Mhux ċert li Scorese ma jfissirx li jittieħdu b'mod serju; huwa biss li huwa magħżul vettura spirituż li permezz tagħha jesprimu l-imħabba serja tal-films. Meta tgħid, " Imma Hugo mhuwiex primarjament dwar il-film, minkejja l-Méliès tie-ins," jien misted. I jagħtu li inti ssib ħafna elementi ta' Hugo fuq il-familja u l-familja u sħiħa ta' l-Isleネbjani wonder-emoting—hemm xejn I jistgħu jagħmlu biex jargumentaw dwar dik il-perċezzjoni, li l-oħra Hugo dubji jaqsmu. Xi kultant film ifisser li CHARM u enchant, u ma għal xi wħud; inti ħadthom ltqajna Hugo u jien ltqajna Amélie, għalkemm naħseb li dan tal-aħħar, deliberatament artifiċjali kif huwa, ifisser għalina biex isibu dan romantic. (Minkejja dan, xi kontraċezzjoni mekkanika li teħel għal segwiment ta' Saw.)<br/><br/>Imma biex ngħidu li Hugo mhuwiex primarjament dwar il-film?Jekk mhux dwar il-film, allura huwa l-istorja l-aktar li ma toħloqx tbatija dwar [ikun xi jkun taħseb li huwa dwar] I qatt jidher. Ir-relazzjoni bejn Hugo u Méliès hija l-qalb tal-film, u fil-qalba ta' dik mhix biss xi konnessjoni tal-ħażniet bejn Plucky orfni u Crusty Old Guy B'Qalb tad-Deheb, iżda affinità kondiviża għal magic engineeredment il- magic tal-films. Naħseb li l-Scorse u l-kollaboraturi tiegħu sabu mod kif jesprimu l-entużjażmu tagħhom matul il-jiem bikrija taċ-ċinema permezz ta' fantasija li huwa aċċessibbli għall-etajiet kollha.L-għan ewlieni tat-tfal mimlija periti huwa s-sempliċi qoxra hawn; iċ-ċinema hija l-pie. (Mmm... pie.)<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Għal dak li għandu x'jaqsam mal-Każ kurjuż ta' Benjamin, ma narax ħafna rabta, ħlief il-fatt li nkixef bħala difensur tal-buttuna Benjamin bħala mezz biex jagħmel ħsara lill-kredibilità tiegħi. (Inċidwalment, kif huma l-ispejjeż fuq dik il-G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blue-ray)? Qaltlek li l-papà ġdid ta' rqad fil-kont tiegħi kien forsi vulnerabbli għal Benjamin Buttuna, iżda ma nistax nimmaġina ħin meta l-premessa tat-tixjiħ inversa ma tiċċaqlaqni. (Ir-rabta tal-imħabba ta' ħajtek fl-armi tiegħek bħala tarbija? Barra minn hekk, ma tistax tiġi affettwata minn dan?) U barra minn hekk, ma narax kif il-buttuna Benjamin tirrelata ħafna ma' Hugo bħala film li jikkonċerna t-tfal, peress li dan huwa biss segment żgħir ta' storja li tespandi trajettorja ħafna akbar.<br/><br/>Allura kkonvinċejt lilek? X'aktarx li le. Imma jien kuntent li nitgħallem li Hugo ma kienx kompletament nieqes mill-entachments għalik. Is-sekwenzi fuq Méliès il-produttur tal-film huma dak li ppromul għali—u b'hekk, tal-inqas, nistgħu naqsmu xi imħabba tal-films.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I ma tistax tgħid li inti stajt konvintli, xi aktar minn stajt konvint li inti., Huwa impossibbli li jargumentaw xi ħadd fl-imħabba viżwali ta'kull ħaġa, u huwa tassew impossibbli li jitkellmu xi ħadd isfel mill-imħabba viżwali. L-aktar, inti stajt let me tara Hugo fil-Scott-O-Vision, li hija esperjenza interessanti; mill-inqas issa jien konvint ħafna li aħna ma b'xi mod jimmaniġġjaw biex tara films kompletament differenti li kemm b'xi mod kellhom l-istess isem u direttur.<br/><br/>Aħna ċertament kellhom esperjenzi differenti, għalkemm, u l-moħħ tiegħi, ffokat fuq l-aspetti differenti tal-produzzjoni: għadni ma narax it-tema "film huwa meraviljuż" bħala l-linja waħda tal-filmat, tant bħal waħda fost ħafna. Il-"polit mingħajr tbatija" kważi tkopri dan, għalkemm stajt tarmi fil "ħafna drabi bla bżonn ħelu u prezzjuż" fuq il-quċċata ta' dak. Waqt li int m'intix ffokat fuq il-mili ta' pie fit-togħma tal-film, nħoss bħal dik pie kienet miksija bil-lira ta' zokkor kristallin, u naħseb li jagħmel differenza, irrispettivament mill-messaġġ tal-qalba tal-film jew numru żgħir ta' xeni terrific. Ara wkoll il-buttuna Benjamin, li ma rnexxejtxielkom—Tassew nemmen li taħseb li għandek aktar minn ħarsa sentimentanti milli nagħmel fir-rigward tat-tfal fiċ-ċinema, speċjalment meta dawn qed jintużaw aktar bħala simboli ta' vulnerabbiltà u innoċenza milli bħala karattri umani. Hey, inti taf liema film totalment m'għandux aptit cute ħafna li ġġib it-tama għal dinja ċiklu? G.I. Joe: Iż-żieda ta' Cobra.maybe I se jmorru jaraw dawk l-extras Blu-ray. I jistgħu jużaw xi splużjoni-insulina biex jikkumpensaw għall-ħlewwa ta' Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Naħsbu t-tifla tiegħi tkun ħielsa minn żminijiet diffiċli u ta' inkwiet": Me Mee's-istorja bħala refuġjat Mom<br/><br/>tama fi żminijiet ta' Kriżi: Istorja ta' Jum l-Omm<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee smajtu li s-suldati kienu ġejjin. Hija ħadet ħsieb ibnu u ssieħbet finanzjarjament mal-bqija tal-irħula li kienu qed jimxu lejn il-fruntiera Thai-Brumse, fejn kien jinsab l-Uffiċċju tal-Kummissarju Għoli tan-Nazzjonijiet Uniti għar-Refuġjati (UNHCR). Ir-raġel tagħha kien f'raħal ieħor li beda fid-direzzjoni opposta, Me aktar tard tgħallem. Wara li ntemmet is-suldati, Mee rritornaw lura d-dar lejn ir-raħal żgħir tagħha f'Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>Matul is-snin 1997-2000, Mee u eluf bħalha kienu jgħixu taħt it-theddida kostanti ta' vjolenza mis-suldati ta' Burmese. Ħafna nies se jieħdu refuġjati temporanji fil-ġungla, u jirritornaw id-dar lejn ir-raħal tagħhom wara li s-suldati ħallew iż-żona, biss biex jagħmlu dan kollu għal darb'oħra jiem aktar tard. Xi darba fil-ġimgħa, Mei u oħrajn ikunu fuq il-mossa biex jevitaw jaqbdu, stupru, jew mewt minn suldati.<br/><br/>Matul inċident wieħed, ir-raġel ta' Mee 'l quddiem mill-mara tiegħu biex jassigura l-ikel għall-familja tiegħu. Ir-raġel tagħha kien maqful minn suldati u maqtul. Il-bullet stajna porzjon tar-ribage tiegħu, u ħalla lilu midruba severament u f'diffikultà hekk kif kien vjaġġ lejn il-ġungla mal-familja tiegħu għas-sikurezza.<br/><br/>Għal tliet xhur, ir-raġel ta' Mee marid u mart il-familja b'ferita mifruxa fuq in-naħa tiegħu. Ma kien jirċievi l-ebda kura medika, ħlief għall-kitba ta' Mee.<br/><br/>"I kien jibżgħu li jirritornaw lejn Burma," Me qal permezz ta' interpretu. "Nidsbu l-ikel u nikkret kuljum," hi kompliet.<br/><br/>Ir-raġel ta' Mee eventwalment naqas biżżejjed biex jimxi ħamest ijiem lejn raħal żgħir fit-Tajlandja fejn tgħallem il-post ta' sptar u kamp ta' refuġjat. Meta Mee u r-raġel tagħha finalment waslu fl-isptar, hu għadda minn kirurġija immedjata u aktar tard rkuprat.<br/><br/>Simbolu ta' tama<br/><br/>Il-ħajja fil-ġungla għal dawk li jaħarbu s-suldati ta' Burme kien tabilħaqq terrifying u diffiċli.Għandu t-tined tal-bambù b'saqaf u kisi tal-art biss saru residenzi temporanji xierqa. Ħafna nisa fosthom Mee taw twelid lit-tfal fil-ġungla. Imbagħad me's mar joqgħod bilqiegħda fuq sitt snin fil-kunsinna ta' sidu jismu Eh Ku Hiser. L-isem tagħha jfisser l-imħabba – kiesaħ – ħelwa. "Cold" fil-kultura tal-Burme ifisser li ma tgħaddix min-nar tal-ħajja, hekk kif is-sħana tirrappreżenta żminijiet inkwiet.<br/><br/>"Naħsbu t-tifla tiegħi tkun ħielsa minn żminijiet diffiċli u ta' inkwiet," qal Me. "Ma ridtx li tgħaddi minn dak li kelli b'esperjenza," hi kompliet.<br/><br/>Għalija, it-twelid ta' bintha f'nofs id-dlam, it-turment u l-biża', kien simbolu ta' tama għal ħajja ġdida. Nittamaw fi żminijiet ta' kriżi, il-premessa stess tal-Kumitat tal-Metodisti tal-Istati Uniti dwar it-Tneħħija tal-MUDCOR (UMCOR) li għadu kif sar, hija wkoll l-essenza ta' dak ix-xemgħat jixħet dawl fuq.<br/><br/>Bidu Ġdid<br/><br/>Bl-għajnuna tal-UNHCR, it-tama għal ħajja ġdida kienet tabilħaqq materjalizza għal Mee u għall-familja tagħha meta kienu jreġġgħu lura fi Springfield tal-Punent, Massachusetts.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

L-partitarji ta' azzjoni affermattiva jagħmlu ħafna argumenti b'appoġġ għal azzjoni affermattiva, bit-tama li ħaddieħor ikun jista' jara l-ġid ġenwin li l-politiki ta' azzjoni affermattiva jġibu lis-soċjetà tagħna. L-partitarji jemmnu li azzjoni affermattiva hija aktar minn politika dwar l-ammissjonijiet u l-kulleġġi u l-universitajiet jieħdu l-inizjattiva żejda biex jilħqu gruppi minoritarji, u jħeġġuhom japplikaw. Il-kulleġġi u l-universitajiet joffru għajnuna finanzjarja addizzjonali u jipprovdu riżorsi fuq il-kampus biex jgħinu aħjar lill-edukazzjoni tal-kulleġġ tal-istudenti. L-partitarji wkoll jinnotaw in-numru dejjem jikber ta' applikazzjonijiet minoritarji għall-kulleġġi u l-universitajiet minħabba parzjalment il-politiki ta' azzjoni affermattivi.<br/>L-istatistika wriet li meta azzjoni affermattiva tiġi eliminata, bħal meta kienet fil-Kulleġġ ta' Berky u l-UCL fl-1998, l-ammissjonijiet tal-istudenti minoritarji kienu ta' 61 fil-mija u 36 fil-mija rispettivament, u dan jagħti prova li l-azzjoni affermattiva għandha rwol ewlieni fil-proċess tal-ammissjonijiet tal-kulleġġ tal-istudenti minoritarji. partitarji ta' azzjoni affermattiva jemmnu wkoll li d-diversità fl-edukazzjoni għolja tipprovdi atmosfera edukattiva aħjar għall-istudenti kollha, personalment u intellettwalment. Jekk trid tiġi eliminata azzjoni affermattiva, ikun hemm inqas studenti minoritarji rreġistrati fil-kulleġġi, li jikkawżaw id-diversità li tkun pjuttost żgħira. Hemm bżonn ukoll politiki ta' azzjoni affermattivi sabiex jikkumpensaw għal sekli sħaħ ta' oppressjoni razzjali, ekonomika, u soċjali. Individwi bi status soċjoekonomiku ogħla għandhom aktar opportunitajiet minn dawk ta' sfondi soċjoekonomiċi aktar baxxi. L-partitarji jemmnu li ċerti gruppi razzjali jew etniċi huma żvantaġġati minħabba li huma ta' spiss f'familji bi dħul aktar baxx u għalhekk mhumiex esposti għall-istess riżorsi bħall-istudenti minn klassijiet soċjoekonomiċi ogħla. L-avukati jappoġġjaw il-kunċett ta' kompetizzjoni bejn l-istudenti bbażat fuq il-mertu, iżda jargumentaw li l-azzjoni affermattiva tikkumpensa għad-differenzi ekonomiċi.

Madankollu, avversarji ta' azzjoni affermattiva jemmnu li wasal iż-żmien biex tintemm azzjoni affermattiv.

Tickets also included the 1:05 p.m.<br/>Columbia Fireflies vs. Rome Braves game and Total Eclipse of the Park.<br/><br/>For those who preferred to beat the heat and watch the eclipse inside, we offered<br/>live stream viewing of NASA TV's Eclipse Megacast in several areas across the Columbia Campus.<br/><br/>A variety of experts visited locations across campus to share how eclipses are woven<br/>into our science, culture, history and art. Allison Marsh, Steven Rodney, Michael Weisenburg, Scott White, Varsha Kulkarni, Nate Carnes and Zhenlong Li each hosted 20-minute public discussions leading up to the eclipse.<br/><br/>The Department of Physics and Astronomy operated 10 outdoor and 5 indoor viewing stations across campus with telescopes, activities and/or NASA live video streams. Viewers<br/>could choose their eclipse experience with access to expert discussions and telescopic technology<br/>or fun activities such as disc golf and family-friendly crafts.<br/><br/>USC's Naturalist-in-Residence Rudy Mancke visited viewers on the historic Horseshoe to share the nature of the solar eclipse,<br/>leading up to the 2.5 minutes of totality beginning at 2:41 pm.<br/><br/>After the sun fully re-emerged, the university hosted an Eclipse Reception for rising high school seniors and upcoming graduate students.<br/><br/>In the late afternoon, the Darla Moore School of Business hosted a free, public talk<br/>by Dr. Craig Roberts, a distinguished professor and senior physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, one<br/>of the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratories for science and engineering<br/>research. In his "Laying the God Particle to Rest" discussion, Dr. Roberts discussed Higgs Boson and why it cannot be used to identify<br/>the source of more than 98 percent of the universe's visible mass.<br/><br/>The big day finally came to a close at Williams Brice Stadium where visitors could<br/>enjoy the university's gridiron stars. An open practice of the 2017 Gamecock football team was the perfect ending to a phenomenal day.<br/><br/>Highlighting History<br/><br/>Campus visitors could mingle alongside eclipse experts and everyone near and far was invited to share in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Learn<br/>more about how we welcomed this historic event:<br/><br/>NASA Official Viewing Location<br/><br/>We were honored to be named an Official Viewing Location by NASA. Viewers at our 15 on-campus<br/>viewing stations enjoyed access to eclipse-related experts and other educational opportunities<br/>while safely enjoying the solar eclipse. | Għodod<br/><br/>Riżorsi:<br/><br/>Mill-astronomija sal-istorja,<br/><br/>kellna ħarsa interna lejn l-eclips ta' 2017,.<br/><br/>total ta' l-eclips<br/><br/>Columbia, SC kienet waħda mill-aħjar postijiet għall-esperjenza ta' l-Amerika ' s-kosta sal-kosta totali solari eżemplari mill-1918.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinazzjonijiet<br/><br/>Kombinazzjonijiet Huma difiżi kontra tip differenti ta' attakki.Għandu ħafna ismijiet madwar l-arti marzjali imma (fl-esperjenza tiegħi) kull arti għandha verżjoni minnhom. Dan jagħmilhom differenti mill-forom għax hemm ħafna arti marzjali li m'għandhom l-ebda forma. X'tagħmel hemm eżerċizzji msieħba daqshekk universali? Għaliex prattika rispons speċifiku meta (fir-realtà), it-tip ta' attakk, id-daqs tal-attakk, u mijiet ta' fatturi oħra se jagħmluha biex qatt ma tuża dak ir-rispons kollu kkulurit? U fl-aħħar nett, kif nistgħu nipprattikaw għal sitwazzjoni ta' difiża reali u nevitaw dannu fl-istess ħin?<br/><br/>L-universalità tal-kombinazzjonijiet hija impressjonanti, biex jiġifieri l-inqas.L-istil tagħna tal-Kenpo karate għandu lista ta'108 combos li jistgħu jitgħallmu. (Il-biċċa l-kbira tal-istudenti jitgħallmu biss 20-30 għalkemm) Fil-Brażil Jiu-Jitsu inti tqatta' klassijiet sħaħ tipprattika l-vireg ta' driegħ u chokes, titgħallem kull sottili għall-mossa filwaqt li l-partner tiegħek joffri ftit li xejn reżistenza. Kull boxer tkun għaddiet sigħat quddiem il-borża u/jew mera li tarmi l-istess kombinazzjoni ta' punches sakemm il-korp jiċċaqlaq b'rifless waħedhom. Kombinazzjonijiet huma universali għaliex m'għandna l-ebda mod aħjar biex jintroduċu moviment u mbagħad jipprattikaw il-pożizzjonijiet sottili meħtieġa biex jagħmluhom xogħol. Tolqot punt ta' pressjoni żgħira permezz tal-ħwejjeġ jieħu a LOT ta' prattika, li jaqtgħu l-istrixxa tad-driegħ bil-kontroll jeħtieġ ġenbejn b'attenzjoni mqiegħda u l-konfigurazzjoni sneaky, u kombinazzjoni kbira hija utli biss jekk inti tista' tgħaddi minnha minn pożizzjoni bilanċjata u protetta. Tista' taħseb b'mod aħjar biex tikseb dawn il-ħiliet?<br/><br/>Hemm xi numru ta' fatturi li jiddeterminaw kif inti tirrispondi għal attakk u jekk fil-logħba rebbiegħa jew fil-ġlieda kontra, I jkollhom QATTI użati kombinazzjoni sħiħa fid-difiża tiegħi. Għaliex, allura, aħna jqattgħu sigħat prattika minnhom? Nprattikaw dawn ir-reazzjonijiet ikkategorizzati minħabba li l-objettiv mhuwiex li tiġbed kombinazzjoni 8 minn kull darba li tara ippanċjar ganċ iżda li turik mod wieħed kif timblokkaha u mbagħad mod possibbli biex issegwiha. Qatt ma għażilt li tuża kombinazzjoni 3 f'sitwazzjoni realtà iżda l-blokka hija waħda mill-go-biex jiċċaqlaq. kombinazzjonijiet Żid għodod għall-għodda li ma tiffissax il-karozza.<br/><br/>L-aħħar mistoqsija hija kwistjoni ta' sigurtà.Jekk aħna jipprattikaw għall-fini tar-realtà għandna bżonn nirreplikaw ir-realtà. Kif aħna nipprevjenu l-ħsara waqt li nagħmlu dan? Meta niġu isfel għaliha, huwa dwar il-bini ta' fiduċja. Aħna jibdew bil-mod u jitgħallmu l-fiduċja li għandna kontroll fuq lilna nfusna., Aħna jitgħallmu l-imsieħba tagħna jkollhom kontroll kif ukoll., F'aktar ħin aħna jitgħallmu li tafda l-kontroll tagħna fuq is-sieħeb tagħna u (ftit barriera) aħna jitgħallmu tafda l-kontroll tal-partner tagħna fuq lilna. Fl-aħħar (bil-lott ta' prattika) tista' tiċċaqlaq huma b'veloċità sħiħa, tossssing partner tiegħek, u qed jintefa mingħajr biża' ta' korriment.<br/><br/>Kombinazzjonijiet huma universali għal raġuni; huma prattikati sabiex ikunu jistgħu jiġu diskussi fil-partijiet tagħhom, u aħna jibqgħu bla periklu billi nibdew bil-mod u nibnu l-fiduċja. Bħal kull ħaġa oħra fl-arti marzjali, il-kombinazzjonijiet għandhom ħafna raġunijiet wara l-prattika u l-eżekuzzjoni tagħhom. |
