| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Johnson iffirma l-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjonijiet tas-sena 1965.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Kważi s-seklu ilu, il-15 Emenda għall-Kostituzzjoni stqarret, "Id-dritt taċ-ċittadini tal-Istati Uniti li jivvutaw m'għandux jiġi miċħud jew irranġati mill-Istati Uniti jew minn kwalunkwe stat minħabba r-razza, il-kulur jew il-kundizzjoni preċedenti ta' servitù." U kważi seklu qabel dan, missier fundatur tan-nazzjon tagħna stabbilit fil-mozzjoni l-esperiment kbir tad-demokrazija Amerikana billi ddikjara li "l-irġiel kollha huma maħluqa ugwali."<br/><br/>L-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjonijiet tal-1965 kien rikonoxxut li anke fl-Amerika, l-ideali fundamentali tagħna għandhom ftit piż jekk ma jkunux protetti mill-istat tad-dritt. Huwa għalhekk li Taqsima 2 tal-15 ta' Emenda tat lill-Kungress "is-setgħa li dan l-artikolu jiġi infurzat b'leġiżlazzjoni xierqa."<br/><br/>U fil-fatt, il-lingwa kkodifikata tal-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjoni setgħet tikseb dak li l-Kungress dwar ir-Rikostruzzjoni u t-Tuma Jefferson ma setax jikseb. L-Att dwar id-Drittijiet Ċivili tas- 1964 u l-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjoni — u l-moviment tad-drittijiet ċivili li minnu ħarġu — serva bħala katalist għal żieda drammatika fl-opportunità biex l-Amerikani suwed jipparteċipaw fil-proċess demokratiku.<br/><br/>Pereżempju, 6.7 fil-mija biss ta' Mississippi iswed eliġibbli ġew irreġistrati biex jivvutaw mill-1962; sa 1969 dik iċ-ċifra kienet laħqet 66.5 fil-mija. Illum, Mississippi għandu aktar uffiċjali eletti suwed minn kwalunkwe stat ieħor.<br/><br/>Il-protezzjonijiet stabbiliti mill-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjoni kienu twal meta għaddew, rappreżentant tal-ġlieda kontra l-ksib tagħhom ħażin. Iżda bla ħsieb, dawn il-protezzjonijiet issa qegħdin taħt attakk, jipperikola l-progress li għamlet in-nazzjon tagħna b'dan il-mod.<br/><br/>Is-sena l-oħra, fil-każ ta' Shelby County vs Id-detentur, il-Qorti Suprema tal-Istati Uniti qatgħet komponent ewlieni tal-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjoni li ppermetta li ssir reviżjoni minn qabel federali biex tiġi żgurata nondiskriminazzjoni qabel ma jkun hemm fis-seħħ kwalunkwe liġi ġdida dwar il-votazzjoni.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Sfortunatament, ir-rispons tal-mexxejja Repubblika ma kien li jagħmlu xejn. Sen. Ted Cruz u l-Gov. Rick Perry ħareġ mill-mod tagħhom biex ifaħħar id-deċiżjoni tal-Qorti Suprema. Sen. Rand Paul ċaħad il-ħtieġa kontinwa tal-Att dwar id-Drittijiet tal-Votazzjoni billi innotaw, "Aħna għandna president Afrikan-Amerika."<br/><br/>Filwaqt li l-elezzjoni tal-President Barack Obama kienet tabilħaqq ġrajja storika, huwa perikoluż li naħsbu li huwa jneħħina milli jibqgħu attenti kontra l-konsegwenzi l-aktar vinkolanti tal-passat tan-nazzjon tagħna. L-iskart li bih l-istati ċċaqalqu biex jintroduċu restrizzjonijiet tal-votazzjoni huwa konferma li l-protezzjonijiet stabbiliti mit-Taqsima 4 għadhom meħtieġa.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Il-gvernaturi Russi ffirmaw restrizzjonijiet stretti fir-rigward tal-identifikazzjoni tar-ritratti fil-liġi bħala s-soluzzjoni għal problema kważi ineżistenti ta' immunizzazzjoni tal-votanti, b'mod sproporzjonat ta' jekk in-nisa, iż-żgħażagħ, il-familji tax-xogħol u l-komunità Afrikana-Amerikana. Huwa għaqli għar-Repubbliki bħal Paul biex ifittxu l-voti ta' dawn il-komunitajiet meta jemmnu li "m'hemm xejn ħażin" li jpoġġu fis-seħħ restrizzjonijiet li jagħmluha aktar diffiċli biex dawn il-kostwenzi jivvutaw.<br/><br/>Ir-rikorrenti talbu wkoll li jirrestrinġu l-perjodi ta' votazzjoni bikrija, inkluż il-Ħadd ta' qabel il-Jum tal-Elezzjonijiet, meta knejjes Afrikani-Amerikani kellhom suċċess kbir b'Russi għall-programmi tal-Pols.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Dawn ir-restrizzjonijiet jirrappreżentaw sforz kbir mir-Repubbliki biex jagħmlu l-votazzjoni aktar iebsa, ibbażata fuq kalkoli politiċi dejjaq u fuq perjodu ta' żmien qasir li r-Repubbliki jistgħu jirbħu l-elezzjonijiet billi jaqtgħu d-daqs tal-elettorat.<br/><br/>Id-demokraziji għandhom missjoni differenti ħafna meta jiġu biex jivvutaw: biex jiġi żgurat li kull vot eliġibbli jista' jirreġistra, li kull vot reġistrat jista' jivvota u li kull vot jingħadd b'mod preċiż.<br/><br/>reklam<br/><br/>Il-Proġett tal-Voterpanza tal-Kumitat Nazzjonali Demokratika jirrifletti t-twemmin tagħna li parteċipazzjoni akbar tal-votanti ssaħħaħ in-nazzjon tagħna u d-demokrazija tagħna.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Espert tas-salvagwardja tal-Vatikan Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 ta' Ġunju 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ.

Iżda m'hemm l-ebda mudell wieħed li jagħti lill-vittmi mhux biss l-ispazju biex jesprimu ruħhom u jkunu mismugħa, iżda wkoll biex jinvolvu ruħhom b'mod attiv fl-iżvilupp tal-Knisja.<br/><br/>F'termini tal-istabbiliment ta' spazji għall-appoġġ għall-vittmi, x'inhuma xi affarijiet li rajt li jistgħu verament jgħinu — u li nistgħu nkunu qed nikkunsidraw hawn fl-Awstralja?<br/><br/>Wieħed mill-punti ewlenin li ħafna vittmi jġibu huwa, 'Ma jistax ikollna, fi ħdan l-issettjar tal-parroċċa, konversazzjoni regolari li ssir fuq li tinkludi lis-superstiti ta' abbuż bħala membri regolari ta' kumitat, kummissjoni, bord ta' sondaġġ, grupp ta' feedback jew xi ħaġa bħal dik?' Sabiex din il-leħen mhux biss jinġieb f'okkażjoni speċifika, jew fejn persuna tħossha f'pożizzjoni li tkun tista' titkellem dwarha, imma [semgħet] fuq bażi regolari — tibni dik il-vuċi fis-sistema.<br/><br/>Dan se jgħinna lkoll. Dan se jgħin lis-superstiti u lill-vittmi minħabba li se jħossu merħba u apprezzat fl-esperjenza speċifika, u fl-isfidi tal-ħajja speċifiċi, li għaddew. It-tieni nett, dan se jgħin lill-komunità inġenerali, għaliex aħna tal-inqas nistgħu nagħmlu lilna nfusna aktar u aktar sensittiv għal dak li huma t-tħassib u l-ħtiġijiet speċifiċi tas-superstiti — li jistgħu wkoll jitkellmu mal-ħtiġijiet taż-żgħażagħ.<br/><br/>M: Għandna gruppi b'saħħithom ta' superstiti hawn fl-Awstralja li setgħu jappoġġjaw lil xulxin permezz ta' dak il-proċess. Iżda dak li qed tgħid huwa li għandna bżonn xi mod biex nappoġġjaw lil dawk il-gruppi, u li nappoġġjaw lil dawk in-nies, permezz tal-istituzzjonijiet tagħna stess ukoll?<br/><br/>U naħseb li għandna bżonn inkunu kreattivi. Se naħdmu għal skola waħda u parroċċa waħda u għad-djoċesi waħda b'mod wieħed, u għal oħrajn b'mod differenti. Minħabba li s-superstiti li magħhom jien f'kuntatt kostanti, huma għandhom talbiet pjuttost simili, u esperjenzi simili fir-rigward li jiġu milqugħa fil-Knisja jew le — jikkontribrixxu ma' jew twarrab. Imma huma wkoll fost l-aspettattivi pjuttost differenti., Għalhekk tgħallimt li għandek ukoll li tkun ġejja ħafna fl-aċċettazzjoni tad-differenzi f'dak il-grupp speċifiku, jew f'dan is-superstiti speċifiċi, trid, titlob u l-ħtiġijiet.<br/><br/>M: Is-superstiti jitkellmu dwar li jkunu jixtiequ li jkollhom l-istejjer tagħhom jinstemgħu u jkunu rikonoxxuti.Aħna kellna l-Kummissjoni Rjali hawn fl-Awstralja, li pprovdiet proċess indipendenti fejn il-vittmi setgħu jitressqu. Hemm bżonn ta' xi ħaġa bħal dik f'termini ta' proċess ta' verità, ġustizzja u rikonċiljazzjoni għall-Knisja fuq livell internazzjonali?<br/><br/>H: Iva, naħseb li hemm bżonn li internazzjonalment, imma naħseb li l-ewwel kull knisja lokali trid tagħmel il-homework tagħha stess. Ma narax li qed jiġri malajr ħafna li xi kunsill jew kummissjoni bħal dawn ikunu stabbiliti biex iħarsu f'dan il-qasam għall-Knisja kollha. Il-Knisja għandha sħubija ta' 1.3 biljun ruħ, u hija preżenti f'190 pajjiż, bit-tipi kollha ta' differenzi fl-aspettattivi dwar l-appoġġ psikoloġiku, spiritwali u finanzjarju.<br/><br/>Hemm ħaġa waħda li stajt jiltaqgħu b'mod konsistenti fil-komunikazzjoni, jaħdmu mal u jisimgħu lill-vittmi, u li huma jridu jiġu mismugħa. Mela jekk kien hemm is-sentiment li l-vittmi kienu kontinwament jiġu mismugħa — f'Ruma u x'imkien ieħor — naħseb li kien jagħti ħelsien kbir lil ħafna vittmi.<br/><br/>Jien naħseb li l-kunċett ta' [Papa Franġisku], speċjalment fir-rigward tal-mistoqsija tiegħek, huwa li l-knejjes lokali jagħmlu dak li jistgħu sabiex il-vittmi jiġu mismugħa f'dak il-pajjiż partikolari. Għandi lista ta' nies li jixtiequ jitkellmu mal-Missier Mqaddsa direttament, u fiżikament huwa impossibbli. Kien hemm fl-2014 biex issarraf żewġ superstiti Ġermaniżi li kienu magħżula b'żewġ superstiti Irlandiżi u tnejn bl-Ingliż meta rċieva s-sitt wieħed minnhom id-dar. Huwa ħa s-smigħ kollu ta' filgħodu wara l-ieħor. Għal kull wieħed, kien hemm għal 40 sa 45 minuta. Kienu jagħmlu dan għal kull superstiti li ma setax jorqdu aktar.<br/><br/>L-eżempju tiegħu huwa l-immudellar għall-Knisja Kattolika kollha l-mod ta' kif il-vittmi u s-superstiti jirċievu, jilqgħu u jisimgħu. Naħseb li jekk l-isqfijiet u l-provinċji f'din id-dinja, fil-pajjiżi kollha, segwew l-eżempju tiegħu, ħafna superstiti jkunu verament rappreżentattivi ta' dak.<br/><br/>L-Arċisqof Djamud Martin dan l-aħħar ġie kkwotat eżatt qabel il-Laqgħa Dinjija tal-Familji, dwar il-Kummissjoni Pontifiċju, u qal li huwa żgħir wisq peress li bħalissa huwa stabbilit biex jintlaħaq dak li għandu bżonn. Il-Knisja għandha bżonn tagħmel aktar riżorsi dwar kif qed tissorvelja dawk il-kwistjonijiet?<br/><br/>Bħalissa aħna 16-il membru minn bażikament il-kontinenti kollha, u l-gruppi lingwistiċi ewlenin. Aħna nirrappreżentaw varjetà ta' dixxiplini u professjonijiet, u l-iskop tal-kummissjoni — bħala l-istatuti li għadhom kemm ġew promulgati — huwa li nipprovdu parir lill-Missier Mqaddsa.<br/><br/>L-ewwel nett, kwistjoni komuni dwar il-kummissjoni hija li nittrattaw każijiet ta' allegazzjonijiet. Dan mhuwiex il-każ. M'għandna l-ebda setgħa ġudizzjarja jew amministrattiva fir-rigward ta' każijiet, minħabba li meta niġu għal allegazzjonijiet ta' abbuż tat-tribunali u tal-proċedura huma stabbiliti.<br/><br/>It-tieni ħaġa importanti hi li nippromwovu, direttament, l-affarijiet fuq il-post. L-ewwel għan tagħna huwa li nagħtu parir lill-Missier Mqaddsa dwar kwistjonijiet.<br/><br/>Għalhekk, mill-perspettiva tiegħi, iva, għandna bżonn ninvestu aktar. Iżda jeħtieġ li ninvestu aktar fuq il-livell lokali, u jeħtieġ li niżguraw li l-proposti tal-Kummissjoni Pontifiċju jintbagħtu lill-Missier Mqaddsa - li normalment jagħmel il-President - u mbagħad ikun hemm proċess ta' segwitu li jirrifletti dak li tajna bħala l-parir tagħna.<br/><br/>Fl-Awstralja, l-Istandards Professjonali Kattoliċi Limited qed jissorveljaw ir-rispons tal-Knisja u jipprovdu linji gwida u appoġġ biex jiżguraw li l-istituzzjonijiet kollha fil-Knisja huma istituzzjonijiet tas-sigurtà tat-tfal. Hemm bżonn ta' xi tip ta' appoġġ organizzazzjonali minn Ruma għal dawk l-isqfijiet u d-djalogi li qed jissieltu biex jiffurmaw dawn l-istituzzjonijiet u jipprovdu protezzjoni f'dawk id-djalogi?<br/><br/>Fl-aħħar mill-aħħar naħseb li l-Kummissjoni se tiżviluppa f'dik il-linja. Issa qegħdin fil-proċess tal-kiri ta' esperti f'dawk l-oqsma.<br/><br/>Naħseb li l-Knisja għandha bżonn tifhem li l-knejjes lokali jistgħu jitgħallmu minn xulxin b'mod reċiproku, u l-fehim tiegħi dejjem kien — u naħseb li l-Missier Mqaddsa ifakkarna — li l-Knisja mhux se tiffunzjona bħala kumpanija ċentralizzata. Ma jaħdimx bħal dan, b'mod effettiv. Kull isqof, kull konferenza isqof, għandu, sa ċertu punt, il-ħajja tiegħu waħdu.X'għandna bżonn titgħallem aktar huwa li niftħu kanali ta' komunikazzjoni reċiproka.<br/><br/>Hemm għadd ta' affarijiet li n-nies tort għall-abbuż fil-Knisja. Bħala saċerdot u psikologu, u bħala xi ħadd li ltaqa' u ħadem mas-superstiti, x'inhuma l-ħsibijiet tiegħek dwar din il-kwistjoni?<br/><br/>Naħseb li l-kwistjoni ta' fejn jiġi l-abbuż hija l-aktar waħda importanti, u l-Papa indirizza li fl-ittra tiegħu lill-poplu t'Alla ppubblikata fl-20 ta' Awwissu. Huwa jgħid fl-ewwel paragrafu, u jerġa' jirrepetih u jerġa' lura, li l-kwistjoni tal-abbuż sesswali hija dejjem marbuta — jew kważi dejjem marbuta — mhux biss mal-kwistjoni tal-abbuż tal-poter, iżda wkoll mal-abbuż tal-kuxjenza.<br/><br/>Għalhekk, il-kwistjoni fundamentali reali tal-abbuż hija ħafna iktar kumplessa milli biss [il-mistoqsija dwar is-sesswalità]—kemm hi eterosesswali jew omosesswali. Hija kwistjoni ta' qawwa, u hemm bżonn li verament naħdmu fuq il-kwistjoni ta' kif nifhmu l-pristhood, kif nifhmu l-isqof, kif nifhmu u ngħixu l-ministeri tagħna? X'inhuma l-fruntieri?<br/><br/>Hu għalhekk li jien kuntent ħafna li l-Provinċja Lhud fl-Awstralja qed tistabbilixxi Kodiċi ta' Kondotta. Minħabba li ma nitkellmux biss dwar l-abbuż sesswali tal-minorenni. Aħna nitkellmu dwar l-abbuż sesswali tal-adulti, u nitkellmu dwar l-abbuż b'modi oħra – bħall-abbuż tal-kuxjenza, fejn int tiddetta lil xi ħadd li taħseb, jew li tippreżenta biex tkun taf minn Alla, u tistaʼ tgħid lil persuna oħra, 'Jeħtieġ li tagħmel dan', kontra l-kuxjenza taʼ dik il-persuna.<br/><br/>Ħafna nies jaħsbu li ċ-ċelebrità tipproduċi l-abbuż. Bħalma dejjem ngħid, iċ- ċelebrità bħala tali mhix kawża għall-abbuż — inkella kif nispjegaw li 99 fil-mija tal-abbużi kollha ma jgħixux ħajja ċiberita, u kif nispjegaw li 95 jew 96 fil-mija tal-qassisin kollha ma jabbużawx lill-minuri? Iżda, iċ- ċelebiċità, jew il- ħarsa taʼ chastity, li mhix verament integrata, li mhix verament għexet kif suppost - iva, li tipproduċi problema. Xi drabi n-nies jieħdu biex jixorbu, xi kultant jieħdu biex logħob, u xi kultant jieħdu għall-kondotta sesswali, ma' adulti u ma' minorenni.<br/><br/>Il-mistoqsija reali dwar dan hija kif nittrattaw il-kunċett ta' poter spiritwali reliġjuż li bih jiġu investiti l-qassisi u l-isqfijiet? Kif tista' tgħinna nifhmu, u forsi kif is-soċjetà, il-psikoloġija, jew l-amministrazzjoni tan-negozju tgħinna biex niddefinixxu l-limiti tal-poter, u n-neċessità li jinżammu l-fruntieri tiegħek |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Fil-fatt, jien mhux sorpriż b'dan id-diskrepanzi., Fil-fatt, jien anke mur s'issa biex ngħid li din mhix xi ħaġa li qatt se tinbidel, u lanqas m'għandna lkoll ntellgħu bil-fwar tagħhom meta nbiddluha. Fi 10 snin, aħna ser ikollhom it-tarf ta'demm, il-punti kumplessi fil-lista l-akbar tħassib, u l-affarijiet aħna qed finalment jkollna madwar biex jifhmu se jkun il-partijiet maġġuri ta'l-infiq tagħna.<br/><br/>Issa, Gunnar u Andy it-tnejn għandhom punti eċċellenti, speċifikament dwar it-timijiet tal-IT jaraw il-problemi tal-IT u jsolvuhom b'soluzzjonijiet tal-IT; fil-fatt, jien pożittiv għall-punti tagħhom żomm il-mertu.<br/><br/>Iżda naħseb li hemm ideat oħra li nfieqfu fuq il-blogs tagħhom dwarha, u aktar tard iddeċidejt li għandi nbloga hawn biss 3 tħassib li qed jonqos b'tali mod li:<br/><br/>aħna jibżgħu affarijiet ġodda għaliex aħna ma jifhmuhom, jew ma jifhmuhomx għaliex qed ġodda.<br/><br/>huma ġodda wisq għalina li jkollhom approċċi solidi għall-immaniġġjar tagħhom.<br/><br/>huma ġodda wisq għalina biex tkun taf jekk għandna nkunu inkwetati jew le!, għandna t-tendenza li inadempjenza għall-paranoid/minkwieta, li huwa tajjeb!<br/><br/>wisq ġdid li jkollok oġġetti tal-baġit ovvji assenjati lilhom. Nista' nixtri kaxxa jew xi softwer li jipprovdi "sigurtà tal-cloud" jew "sigurtà tal-midja soċjali?"<br/><br/>huma hekk ġodda n-negozju lanqas ma jkunu jafu kif jużawhom jew dak li jridu minnhom., Ħallih biss kif nistgħu niżgurawhom waqt li jkunu għadhom għaddejjin jew tal-anqas ma nieqfux il-ħtiġijiet tan-negozju kollha. Jekk in-negozju ma jkunx jaf ukoll kif tużahom s'issa, m'inix ċert li s-sigurtà hija fi kwalunkwe pożizzjoni biex tiggwida dak l-użu b'mod sikur.<br/><br/>Għandu jissemma wkoll li dawn l-affarijiet ġodda qed jiġu mbuttati bil-kbir permezz tal-konsumatur u fin-negozju, bl-IT bħala tip ta', "Oh yeah," ħasbu. Firewalls, AV, AM, Ath huma kollha tweġibiet IT għal kwistjonijiet tipikament IT. Naturalment hemm differenza hemm ukoll kwistjonijiet suġġettivi ħafna, għall-kuntrarju ta' oġġetti oġġettivi ħafna bħal firewalls, bits malizzjużi magħrufa, imġiba, firem, portijiet. In-negozju jippreżenta kwistjonijiet kumplessi ħafna li ħafna drabi jinvolvu lin-nies (li aħna ma tistax kapsula) u li ħafna drabi ma jaqblux b'mod sabiħ fir-regoli imħaffef. Anke jekk aħna daru barra minn soluzzjonijiet tekniċi u ddedikati tagħna ħin fis-soluzzjoni ta' dawn il-problemi, huma xorta mhux se jiġu solvuti pulita. Bl-istess mod, meta timbotta niġu għall-imħabba, jista 'jkollok u jilħqu l-għanijiet bil-firewalls? Dawn il-flussi kollha mill-aspett pjuttost suġġettiv mhux tekniku ta' dawk il-kwistjonijiet. Issortja dwar id-differenza bejn il-karta tar-rapport tat-tfal u l-feedback li tikseb minn konferenza tal-ġenituri tal-għalliema. Jekk għandek tifel/tifla, li wieħed ikun l-aktar inklinati li ma jaqbilx ma' jew mhux neċessarjament jemmnu? (It-tweġiba hija waħda suġġettiva!)<br/><br/>Jista' jingħad li dan huwa l-progress naturali tas-sigurtà u t-teknoloġija: mix-xiri tal-kontrolli tekniċi biex itejjeb il-munzell lejn l-imġiba u n-nies. Kun żgur li dawn it-tliet tħassib ewlenin jistgħu jingħad li jippuntaw permezz ta' firewalls u segmenti tan-netwerk, iżda dan huwa n-natura ta' dawk l-affarijiet (midja soċjali "punching" permezz ta' firewall huwa ferm differenti minn lili ippanċjar permezz ta' konnessjoni tal-SS biex naqqab n-netwerk tad-dar tiegħi; il-midja soċjali hija simili għall-mod * nużaw il-konnessjoni tal-SSH tiegħi wara li l-istiva diġà tkun ippuntata minħabba li hija meħtieġa; jiġifieri l-midja soċjali hija l-mod kif jintuża l-port 80.)<br/><br/>Bażikament, l-indikazzjonijiet kollha punt li ma tkunx sorpriż b'din id-dizzjunarju., U ma naħsibx li din hija xi indikazzjoni ulterjuri li IT/sigurtà tagħmel dan ħażin, jew mhix allinjata sew man-negozju, jew għandha sfond tekniku tas-server tas-soltu. Jien ma tgħid aħna qed tagħmel affarijiet dritt jew aħna qed allinjati sew, iżda dan t'hawn fuq mhuwiex argument tajjeb biex tappoġġja t-teorija ta'dawk in-nuqqasijiet.<br/><br/>Issa għal qabża kbira ħafna ħafna. Nixtieq li ż-żieda attwali fil-kompjuter mobbli tkun kbira bħala l-introduzzjoni tal-kompjuters fin-negozju u aktar tard il-PC/internet fin-negozju. Issa, ma kontx madwar meta ġara l-ewwel, u lanqas ma kont fl-industrija meta r-rivoluzzjoni tal-kompjuter personali nieqaf fin-negozju, imma jien inkun aħjar li huwa l-eqreb paragun s'issa. I jistgħu anke jgħidu l-istess għall-midja soċjali. Dawn huma damned ġodda u dawn qed kbar bidliet lil hinn biss idaħħlu fl-Macs jew softwer ġdid jew xi proċess ta' negozju ġdid. |
