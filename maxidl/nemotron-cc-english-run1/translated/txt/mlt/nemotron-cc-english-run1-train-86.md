| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N.

Il-gazzetti u r-rivisti madwar l-Istati Uniti u l-Ewropa rrappurtat fuq l-esperiment Leclaire, b'mod partikolari matul l-ewwel 20 sena tal-eżistenza tiegħu. Fl‐1979, minħabba l‐istorja unika tiegħu, l‐ewwel raħal kien elenkat fir‐Reġistru Nazzjonali tal‐Postijiet Storiċi.<br/><br/>Leclaire ġie mwaqqaf minn Nelson Nelson, manifattur tal-plumbing St. Louis li, għal ħafna snin, fittex li javvanza l-dawl tal-klassi tax-xogħol. Nelson riedu jtejbu l-kundizzjonijiet tax-xogħol għall-impjegati tiegħu u jipprovdu akkomodazzjoni ħdejn il-fabbriki sabiex il-ħaddiema u l-familji tagħhom ikunu jistgħu jipparteċipaw faċilment fi programmi rikreattivi u edukattivi offruti mingħajr ħlas mill-kumpanija. Qabel 1890, filwaqt li għadhom f'San Louis, in-negozji tal-manifattura u tad-distribuzzjoni ta' N. O. Nelson tal-Kumpanija li bdew jipprovdu qsim tal-profitt flimkien ma' opportunitajiet edukattivi u ta' rikreazzjoni. L-esperiment ta' koperattivi ta' Leclari se jġib benefiċċji addizzjonali.<br/><br/>Meta l-impjegati ta' Nelson indikaw li riedu jirrilokaw lejn post rurali, ir-rappreżentanti tal-kumpanija avviċinaw lill-mexxejja ta' bliet żgħar f'diversi Komunitajiet ta' Missjuni u Illinois qrib il-kwartieri ġenerali tagħhom ta' St. Louis. Huma kienu qed ifittxu li proprjetà xierqa biex jibnu fabbriki ġodda u raħal mudell.In-Nofsinhar ta' Edwardsville sabu passaġġ 125-acre ta' art b'aċċess għall-ilma, il-faħam, u t-trasport. F'inqas minn tliet ġimgħat, il-komunità qajmet fond ta'20,000 minn kontribuzzjonijiet individwali ta' bejn $ 1 u $ 1,000 biex tinċentiva lil Nelson jagħżel Edwardville għall-intrapriża tiegħu.<br/><br/>Il-mexxejja tal-Belt ttamaw li jsibu proprjetà fil-limiti tal-belt ta' Edwardsville, iżda meta l-ebda sit adattat ma seta' jinstab, huma kienu kunfidenti li l-investiment ta' Nelson fin-Nofsinhar tal-belt dalwaqt se jsir parti minn Edwardsville. Għalkemm Nelson wettaq il-kontinġenzi kollha għall-kostruzzjoni u l-ħolqien tal-impjiegi fil-kuntratt tiegħu, ikun ta' 44 sena qabel l-annessjoni ma' Edwardville. Lelari, li hija marbuta minn Madison/Browżen il-lvant, il-linji tal-ferrovija lejn il-Punent, Hadley/McKinley Avenues fuq in-nofsinhar u l-Wolf Street lejn it-tramuntana, baqgħu raħal indipendenti minn 1890 sa 1934. Matul dak iż-żmien hija akkwistat reputazzjoni għall-innovazzjonijiet fin-negozju, l-edukazzjoni u l-ippjanar residenzjali.<br/><br/>Ir-raħal ta' Leclarie fuq il-mappa ta'1931 ta' Edwardsville<br/>Il-korteżija ta' Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Id-deċiżjoni ta' Nelson li jibni raħal ma tteħidx fuq wh. Sal-aħħar 180 sena kien mexxej internazzjonali fl-oqsma tal-kooperazzjoni u l-qsim tal-profitt, u kien jsarraf teoriji soċjali ma' oħrajn madwar id-dinja filwaqt li jespandi n-negozju tiegħu ta' San Louis. Huwa semma r-raħal esperimentali tiegħu wara l-qsim tal-profitt Pariġijan, Edme Jean Leclaire, iżda żar ħafna viżwalizzazzjonijiet soċjali oħra li pprovdew informazzjoni u ispirazzjoni. Nikkompilaw l-aħjar ideat minn dawn l-eżempji, Nelson stabbilit Lelari għal, fi kliemu, "jagħti xogħol, jippromwovi l-intelliġenza, jipprovdi rikreazzjoni, trawwem is-sbuħija, u jagħmel djar." Dawn il-fatturi kollha kienu determinati għall-irġiel biex imexxu ħajja sodisfaċenti. kittieba aktar tard użaw dawn il-kliem biex jifformulaw l-prinċipji fundaturi ta' Lelari: Xogħol, Homes, Edukazzjoni, Rikreazzjoni, u Beauty, iżda bil-prinċipju importanti addizzjonali tal-Libertà.<br/><br/>Xogħol<br/><br/>Ix-xogħol jista' jitqies bħala l-aktar importanti ta' dawn il-fatturi peress li mingħajr l-impjiegi fil-fabbrika f'Leclaire, ma jkun hemm l-ebda raħal. Il-bini tal-fabbrika briks kienu ddisinjati mill-perit E. A. Cameron biex jipprovdu dawl naturali, ventilazzjoni fis-sajf, u pavimenti msaħħna fix-xitwa. Kien hemm sistema ta' trażżin tan-nirien u, għalkemm inċidenti industrijali ma ġewx eliminati, sar kull sforz biex tiġi garantita s-sigurtà tal-ħaddiema. Il-binjiet tal-briks koperti mill-vinju kienu mdawrin b'lawni mħaffrin sew u ġonna tal-fjuri li jagħtu d-dehra kumplessa ta' kampus simili. Fis-sena 184, ir-relatur ta' New York Nellie Bly sejjaħ lill-binjiet “il-perfezzjoni ideali tal-bini għall-bniedem għax-xogħol”.<br/><br/>Il-kumpless tal-manifattura ta' l-N. O. Nelson manifattura kumpanija fil-Leclaire<br/>Mill-Ħbieb ta' Leclaire<br/><br/>Il-ħaddiema setgħu jaqilgħu sehem mill-profitti u jkollhom vuċi fil-kumpanija jekk jagħżlu dik l-għażla. Il-pjan ta' kondiviżjoni tal-profitti ta lil Nelson kburija ta' sjieda li rriżultat f'forza tax-xogħol ta' appoġġ. Kien hemm ftit strajks ta' xogħol b'ħajja qasira matul is-snin, iżda għall-biċċa l-kbira tal-problemi tax-xogħol kienu rari. Barra minn hekk, il-ħaddiema kellhom sigħat raġonevoli u pagi kompetittivi, u kien hemm fond għall-provvediment ta' pensjonijiet u ta' liv tal-mard, kif ukoll pensjoni tal-irtirar jekk ħaddiem miet, kemm jekk il-mewt kienet relatata mal-impjieg tiegħu kif ukoll jekk le.<br/><br/>Il-kwartieri ġenerali tal-kumpanija N. O. Nelson Company (NOCO) baqgħet f'San Louis, iżda l-kumpanija tal-manifattura ta' N.O. Nelson kienet miexja lejn Leclaire. Il-kumpanija tal-manifattura kienet maqsuma fi ħwienet li għamlu varjetà ta' prodotti. Fis-sena 1900, il-ħwienet saru kumpaniji indipendenti għall-finijiet tat-taxxa, iżda kollha kienu għadhom proprjetà tal-kumpanija tal-manifattura N. O. Nelson. Il-ħwienet kienu jinkludu l-impjant tal-Kabinett mitħna fejn ġew prodotti prodotti prodotti injam mill-kabinetti sal-mitħna. Is-sengħa ħadmet hawn ukoll f'kuntratti speċjali, inklużi gaġeġ tal-lukandi għal bank lokali u artaliżmu fl-użu fil-Knisja Specika ta' St. Andrew f'Wadsville. Il-ħanut tal-irħam speċjalizzat fl-irħam arkitettoniku li niżel u ġie installat minn Nelson f'djar, negozji, u anke bdoti tal-istat madwar id-Dar tal-Mediterran. Il-ħanut tal-magna, li sar Bignal u Keeler, għamel magni tat-twaħħil tal-pajpijiet, pompi, gauges, u għodod mekkaniċi varji mistennija fil-kummerċ tal-plumbing. Huma kissru wkoll għall-manifattura ta' oġġetti ta' speċjalità bħal-Leclarie Bicycle in the mid-1890s. Il-ħanut tar-ram inkluda bitħa fejn diversi pajpijiet u għodod tal-ilma kienu manifatturati. Dawn l-eżempji jirrappreżentaw biss wħud mix-xogħol li sar fil-fabbriki tal-Leclaris. Il-logo tal-kumpanija kien stilizzat "NOCO" li xorta jista' jidher fuq il-muntaġġi tal-plumbing u xi idranti tan-nar f'Waddsville llum.<br/><br/>Djar<br/><br/>Qabel ma setgħu jinbnew djar, kien hemm bżonn akkomodazzjoni għall-ħaddiema li kienu qed jimlew il-bini tal-fabbrika kif ukoll djar tal-bini.Biex jilħqu dawk il-ħtiġijiet, il-kumpanija mibnija l-"Club House", bini kbir li serva ħafna skopijiet. Minbarra l-preżentazzjoni, kien l-ewwel bini edukattiv tal-komunità, u kien fih librerija stokks.<br/><br/>Il-kostruzzjoni tal-porzjon residenzjali ta' Leclaire bdiet immedjatament wara li r-raħal ġie mwaqqaf f'Ġunju 1890. Ġulju Pitzman, l-arkitettura tal-pajsaġġ innovattiva li għamlet l-ewwel lottijiet f'Leclarie, waqqfuhom b'għadd ta' patti protettivi. Il-ftehimiet previsti għal toroq wiesgħa, dawk kbar, u restrizzjoni tal-att li tillimita l-proprjetajiet għal skopijiet residenzjali jew edukattivi biss. Il-kumpanija wittiet it-toroq, ipprovdiet id-dwal tat-toroq elettriċi, installati fuq il-ġnub, u mħawla mijiet ta' siġar tul it-toroq ta' Leclaire. Aktar tard it-taqsimiet ta' Leclaire ġew stabbiliti b'disinn konvenzjonali tal-grilja u b'lottijiet iżgħar, iżda xorta ġew inklużi r-restrizzjonijiet tal-att.<br/><br/>A Leclarie Victorian cottage fl-1907<br/>Minn Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Fil-bidu, id-djar inbniet mill-kumpanija u mbagħad biegħu bi prezz qrib lill-impjegati ta' Nelson biex jinkoraġġixxu s-sjieda tad-dar.Jekk ħaddiem sar il-mard u ma setax jagħmel il-ipoteka tiegħu, il-pagamenti ġew sospiżi sakemm jerġa' jaħdem. Id-djar ġew offruti f'varjetà ta' disinji tad-dar u l-kumpanija rriklamat li l-ebda żewġ abitazzjonijiet ma kienu l-istess.L-aktar djar bikrin kienu cottages Vittorjani li ġew bl-elettriku u l-ilma li qed jaħdem. Dawn ġew segwiti minn bungalows, erba' kwadri, u anke xi djar tal-kits.Ir-residenti jistgħu jixtru dar mibnija mill-kumpanija jew jixtru lott vojta u jibnu dar lilhom infushom, sakemm id-disinn arkitettoniku jilħaq l-istandards tal-kumpanija.<br/><br/>F'dawn l-aħħar snin, il-lottijiet kienu mibjugħa lill-investituri, normalment residenti ta' Edwardville, u ħafna djar fis-snin disgħin inbniet mill-kuntratturi lokali li mbagħad kienu jbigħuhom lil residenti taż-żona.<br/><br/>Edukazzjoni<br/><br/>Nelson kien jemmen fl-edukazzjoni għal kulħadd, inkluż il-klassi tax-xogħol.L-ipprogrammar edukattiv beda b'kindergarten fil-Kamra tal-Klabb fl-1892 u kompla fil-bini edukattiv il-ġdid ta' 722 Triq id-Dar. B'mod komuni msejjaħ "Kamra tal-Iskola", dan il-bini pprovda daħla kbira għal-laqgħat u l-programmi, iżda kellu partijiet mobbli biex jaqsamha fl-ispazju tal-klassi matul il-jum. F'dawn l-aħħar versi, kien hemm żfin, laqgħat, jew programmi tal-klabb tal-Università ta' Washington jew kelliema magħrufa b'mod nazzjonali li, bħal N. O. Nelson, kienu parti mill-moviment soċjali tal-imħatri meta biddlu s-seklu. Dawn kienu jinkludu Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Repubblika tad-Deheb" Jones, u l-awtur Charlotte Perkins Gilman, fost oħrajn.<br/><br/>Tfal rreġistrati fil-kindergarten Leclaire fl-1913<br/>Minn Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Fl-għaxar snin wara l-kostruzzjoni tal-bini tal-edukazzjoni 1895, kien hemm serje ta' esperimenti edukattivi inklużi skola industrijali, kulleġġ, skola bil-lejl, u Akkademja. L-ewwel u l-itwal endorjan ħajja kien il-kindergarten filgħodu, stabbilit fl-1892, li uża l-Mudell ta' Fröbel. Dan il-programm ta' sentejn kien ħieles għal kulħadd, inklużi t-tfal ta' Edwardville, sal-1931 meta għal raġunijiet finanzjarji l-kumpanija bdiet titlob tagħlim lill-istudenti li ma kinux it-tfal tal-impjegati. Nelson manifattura mħaddma kindergarten sa 1934 meta l-bini ġie mdawwar mad-Distrett tal-Iskola ta' Edwardville għal tariffa nominali.<br/><br/>Rikreazzjoni<br/><br/>Boaters fuq il-Lag Leclaire fl-1915<br/>Minn Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rikreazzjoni kienet karatteristika importanti ta' Leclaire.Il-kumpanija pprovdiet faċilitajiet sportivi għal baseball, tennis, u aktar tard, futbol. A bowling u billiard sala kienet mibnija u kien hemm lag għal dgħajsa, għawm, sajd, jew ikkastjar tas-silġ fix-xitwa. Leclaire Park ġie mgħammar b'dgħajjes tad-divertiment, djar tal-banju maskili u femminili, u paviljun kbir. Residenti organizzati dances, hyrides, ortografija tan-naħal, u attivitajiet oħra, u l-kumpanija sponsorjata b'mod regolari f'divertiment fir-raħal jew f'Jaddsville. Bħall-funzjonijiet edukattivi fid-Dar tal-Klabbs u l-Iskola, il-faċilitajiet ta' rikreazzjoni f'Leclaire kienu miftuħa għal kulħadd u ħafna drabi kienu destinazzjoni għal Edwardsville u anke għall-viżitaturi ta' San Louis.<br/><br/>Ġmiel<br/><br/>Ritratt bikri ta' Leclaire Lake<br/>Minn Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>L-aħħar waħda mill-fatturi Nelson qieset li huma importanti għal ħajja li tissodisfa l-ambjent. Nelson kien jaf dwar l-importanza tal-ħajja b'saħħitha. Huwa vvaluta s-sbuħija u l-indafa li jistgħu jinstabu fil-pajjiż, u ħeġġeġ lil kulħadd fl-Leclari biex jbattu l-proprjetà tagħhom minn ġonna tat-tħawwil u ġonna. Nelson innifsu wassal għal eżempju, sabiex kumpanija tas-serra pprovduta fjuri u kompetizzjonijiet b'xejn saret għall-aktar tarzni sbieħ.Leclari ġiet stabbilita b'tali mod li r-raħal kollu kellu ambjent ta' park simili għadu evidenti llum.<br/><br/>Il-Libertà<br/><br/>Il-maħżen tal-Koperattiva tal-Leclarie<br/>Minn Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson elenkat ħames prinċipji fundaturi għal Leclaire, iżda kittieba moderni Żid sitta: Il-Libertà.Il-programmi kollha offruti mill-kumpanija kienu disponibbli għall-impjegati kif ukoll għar-residenti lokali, iżda xejn ma kienu obbligatorji. Il-libertà li wieħed jagħżel jekk jipparteċipax fi programmi tal-kumpanija kinitx kompletament sal-individwu. Ir-residenti ta' Leclearle jistgħu jaħdmu għal Nelson manifattura jew x'imkien ieħor, u l-ħaddiema ma kinux taħt l-ebda obbligu biex jgħixu f'Leclaire. Il-parteċipazzjoni fil-programmi rikreattivi u edukattivi kienet ukoll fakultattiva. Kien hemm ukoll ħanut tal-kumpanija fejn l-impjegati setgħu jixtru, iżda b'differenza bliet oħra tal-kumpanija, ħadd ma kien fid-dejn tal-ħanut tal-kumpanija. Il-Leclarie Store kien kooperattiv fejn il-membri kienu mitluba jħallsu prezzijiet tas-suq ġusti, iżda mbagħad ħallsu dividendi ta' kull tliet xhur.<br/><br/>Belt ta' kumpanija differenti<br/><br/>Kollha ta' dawn il-benefiċċji magħmula Leclaire uniku minn bliet oħra tal-kumpanija, iżda kien hemm ukoll każijiet individwali fejn il-kumpanija wriet il-kompressjoni u l-kura għall-impjegati. Il-kumpanija għalqet il-fabbriki u l-ferroviji tal-eskursjonijiet bil-kiri biex tieħu l-ħaddiema u l-familji tagħhom f'San Louis għal ġurnata fil-Fiera ta' San Louis. Meta l-flus kienu ssikkati, Nelson kultant ipoġġi flus żejda f'kull pakkett ta' paga biex il-ħajja ssir aktar faċli għall-ħaddiema, u jekk huwa stabbilixxa programm li l-irġiel ma qablux miegħu, huma tkellmu u, bħallikieku mhijiex, Nelson jerġa' jreġġa' lura lilu nnifsu.<br/><br/>Imwieled f'Lisend, fin-Norveġja, fl-1841, N. O. Nelson kien wieħed mill-kapitali li kien jemmen f'intrapriża ħielsa, iżda wkoll f'soċjetà soċjalista, u f'patrijott li serva għall-Unjoni fil-Gwerra Ċivili. Sa 1900, huwa kien multimillijonaire, iżda maż-żmien tal-mewt tiegħu f'1922, huwa kien tah kollu 'l bogħod għall-aħjar tal-klassi tax-xogħol.<br/><br/>Għalkemm Leclaire ma kienx l-uniku esperiment soċjali ta' Nelson, huwa meqjus li l-aktar isforz ta' suċċess tiegħu. L-isforzi ewlenin l-oħra għall-aħjar soċjali kienu jinkludu katina ta' ħwienet kooperattivi tal-merċa fi New Orleans, kindergarten għat-tfal ta' impjegati iswed fil-Besser tiegħu, Alabama, fabbriki, u dar għall-konsumvitivi fl-Indja, California.<br/><br/>Il-Villaġġ ta' Nelson ta' Leclaire ġie rinomat fuq livell internazzjonali bħala esperiment notevoli u ta' suċċess. Kien deskritt fid-Dinja ta' New York f'diversi okkażjonijiet iżda b'mod partikolari mir-relatur Nellie Bly fl-1894 li kiteb fit-tul dwar il-belt tal-mudell fejn "Il-mistoqsija tax-xogħol hija solvuta u kulħadd kuntent f'raħal żgħir qrib St. Louis." Iż-żminijiet ta' Los Angeles wkoll irrapportati regolarment fuq N. O. Nelson, kif għamlet it-Tribune ta' Kuljum ta' Chicago u bosta pubblikazzjonijiet oħra.<br/><br/>F'diskors fil-15-il ċelebrazzjoni tal-anniversarju ta' Leclaire fl-1915, Nelson qal, "Leclarie jestendilek opportunità miftuħa wiesgħa, u l-offerti inti tgawdi llum il-faċilità u l-kumdità u s-sbuħija u l-ispirazzjoni li aħna ngawdu kuljum." Aktar minn seklu minn dak iż-żmien għadda, iżda l-istedina għadha tirrappreżenta. Ir-residenti u r-riċerkaturi huma mistiedna jitgħallmu dwar l-istorja ta' Lelari u jqisu t-tagħlimiet li jistgħu jittieħdu għall-aħjar ġenerazzjonijiet futuri.<br/><br/>Wieħed mill-binjiet preċedenti tal-kumpless tal-manifattura fl-2019, li issa jservi bħala l-Kampus N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Żjarat ta' Awtur permezz ta' Zoom jew Skype<br/><br/>Jien eċċitati li żżur mal-istudenti tiegħek permezz ta' Zoom jew Skype! Skype hija għażla kbira għall-iskejjel/klassijiet li mhumiex qed iġibu personalment l-awturi, iżda li jixtiequ jesploraw il-kotba u l-poeżija, jgħaqqdu ma' awtur, u jistaqsu mistoqsijiet one-on-one.<br/><br/>Spiża<br/><br/>Noffri żjarat ta' 30-45 minuta Zoom jew Skype ma' skejjel għal $125 kull sessjoni (jew $ 200 għal żewġ sessjonijiet li għaddejjin fi żmien tliet sigħat filgħodu jew wara nofsinhar; $ 325 għal tliet sessjonijiet f'ġurnata waħda; $ 245 għal erba' sessjonijiet f'ġurnata waħda). F'kull sessjoni, nipprova nikseb gidjien involuti b'mod attiv kemm jista' jkun. Le, mhuwiex l-istess tip ta' konnessjoni bħal offerti żjara personalment, iżda xorta tista' tkun ta' ispirazzjoni u motivazzjoni għat-tfal!<br/><br/>X'għandi nagħmel<br/><br/>Kull sessjoni sa 50 student tinkludi:<br/><br/>5 minuti ta' l-sett b'potenzal<br/><br/>3 segmenti ta' 10 minuti kull wieħed — Int tagħżel minn:<br/><br/>Kif għamilt kittieb<br/><br/>Il-kitba ta' dan il-ktieb partikolari (inti tagħżel liema ktieb I tiffoka fuq)<br/><br/>Qari (I aqra xi poeżiji u gidien jgħinni aqra oħrajn)<br/><br/>Preżentazzjoni tal-klassijiet (l-istudenti tiegħek jitqiegħdu fuq qari jew prestazzjoni għalija — udjenza apprezzata ħafna!)<br/><br/>Il-kitba ta' poeżiji flimkien<br/><br/>Sessjoni ta' mistoqsija u tweġiba<br/><br/>5 minuti ta' wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I wkoll chat bi klassijiet ta' għalliema ta' qabel is-servizz jew gruppi ta' għalliema fis-servizz dwar il-poeżija u l-kitba.<br/><br/>Suġġerimenti għal Żjara Virtwali Kbira<br/><br/>Suġġerimenti għal Żjara Virtwali ta' Suċċess<br/><br/>Wieħed mill-għanijiet tiegħi għal żjarat virtwali fl-iskola huwa li jaqbdu l-interattività li tagħmel żjarat personalment b'suċċess u divertiment.Iżda l-verità hija li xi kultant hija iebsa li tkun virtwalment interattiva! Iż-żmien jista' ma jissinkronizzax b'mod korrett, li jagħmel qari flimkien sfida, u huwa verament diffiċli għalija biex jisimgħu l-istudenti individwali sakemm ma jidħlux u jitkellmu direttament fil-mikrofonu/kompjuter. Iżda wara xi prova u żball, stajt skoperta xi modi li jkollhom l-aħjar żjarat virtwali possibbli. Hawnhekk huma: 10 modi biex tagħmel iż-żjara tiegħi mal-istudenti tiegħek esperjenza kbira!<br/><br/>Qabel iż-żjara<br/><br/>Żur il-websajt tiegħi magħhom. Aqra xi wħud mill-kotba tiegħi magħhom. Iġbor xi mistoqsijiet li l-istudenti għandhom għalija. Kwalunkwe ħaġa li għandek tagħmel qabel iż-żmien biex tagħmilha tħoss bħal DEAL tal-BIG se tmur għal triq twila lejn l-involviment tal-istudenti.<br/><br/>Pożizzjoni l-kamera bil-vidjo jew laptop bl-webcam hekk li nista' nara kemm jista' jkun l-udjenza.Huwa diffiċli li nevalwa l-impenn tal-istudenti meta nkun nista' nara biss koppja ta' studenti.<br/><br/>Limitu kull grupp għal studenti 50.Huwa oerhört diffiċli li jingaġġaw gruppi kbar permezz tal-vidjo.<br/><br/>Se niċċaqlaq malajr mis-suġġett jew mill-poeżija.Jekk jogħġbok infakkar lill-istudenti li se jkollhom bżonn jisimgħu mill-qrib biex jifhmu x'inhu għaddej.<br/><br/>Kultant, I do a ftit qarrej Theatre ma' l-istudenti. Jekk I jibgħatlek xi partijiet ta' l-istudent skritt qabel iż-żmien, ipprintja kopja għas-sessjoni ta' l-ECHA u maqtugħ f'biċċiet, jekk meħtieġ.<br/><br/>Matul iż-żjara<br/><br/>Meta niddiskuti ktieb, jekk għandek dak il-ktieb stampat, jekk jogħġbok żommu l-istudenti biex jaraw.<br/><br/>Ħafna drabi ma nistax nċempel lill-istudenti u nisma' t-tweġibiet individwali. Għalhekk, jista' jgħid, "Ninsab lest li tikseb 3 ideat. Tqajjem in-naħa tiegħek jekk ikollok idea." Imbagħad inti tieħu f'idejha, sejħa fuq tliet studenti, u tħabbar dawk it-tweġibiet għal kulħadd fil-kamra u lili.<br/><br/>Agħżel il-kunfidenza, l-istudenti li joħorġu għal partijiet ta' studenti skritti (jekk għandi nibgħat xi żmien qabel). Matul iż-żjarat tal-iskola personali tiegħi, nipprova npinġi xi wħud mill-istudenti inqas kunfidenti, iżda sibt li dan ma jaħdimx kif ukoll matul iż-żjarat virtwali għaliex ma nistax nisma' dawn.<br/><br/>L-istudenti b'partijiet tat-taħdit joqogħdu quddiem.Meta wasal iż-żmien, ikollhom l-istand tagħhom u jfakkruhom biex jitkellmu b'leħen għoli.<br/><br/>Fiż-żjarat virtwali, il-ġestjoni tal-imġiba taqa' unikament fuqek. Ta' spiss ma narax eżattament x'inhu għaddej, u għalhekk jekk jogħġbok pass kif meħtieġ. Jekk hemm tfixkil kbir, staqsini nżomm fuq għal mument sabiex ma niċċarġix fuq filwaqt li l-attenzjoni tal-ħlas ta' ħadd:)<br/><br/>Ħossok liberu li nieħu stampi ta' lili fuq l-iskrin u sehem fuq il-midja soċjali anki jekk ir-ritratti tiegħi spiss jidhru redikoli minħabba li qed nagħmel wiċċ imb'wiċċ jew xi ħaġa waqt li qrajt!<br/><br/>Jekk għandek xi mistoqsijiet, jekk jogħġbok staqsi eżatt, jew qabel jew matul iż-żjara!<br/><br/>Sfida ta' Sessjoni Virtwali<br/><br/>Inti interessat fl-iskedar ta' żjara virtwali miegħi?

| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Aħbarijiet Arkivju<br/><br/>Ktieb ġdid iħares lejn modi li bihom jiġu indirizzati l-isfidi tal-HIV<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis b'Marjorie Human li ddisinja l-għatu tal-ktieb, li jaġixxi fuq l-HIV.<br/><br/>Il-pandemija tal-HIV ġabet l-aħjar u l-agħar fil-bnedmin f'termini ta' rispons.Min-naħa l-waħda wasslet għal stigma u vjolenza u min-naħa l-oħra ġabet magħha risponsi kostruttivi u ta' appoġġ minn diversi individwi u gruppi. Ktieb ġdid, li jaġixxi fuq l-HIV, editjat mill-Prof. Dennis Francis, Dekan tal-Fakultà tal-Edukazzjoni fl-Università tal-Istat Liberu, iħares lejn kif id-dramm jista' jintuża biex jippromwovi bidla soċjali vitali kif ukoll bidla fl-imġiba individwali.<br/><br/>Filwaqt li taġixxi fuq l-HIV toffri inkjesta sistematika fid-dramm bħala approċċ biex tiddiskuti l-HIV/AIDS u l-attitudnijiet relatati u l-imġiba.Il-ktieb huwa test ta' studjuża u jinkludi x-xogħol ta' xi għoxrin awturi kreattivi b'mod eċċezzjonali. L-awturi jikkontribwixxu għall-ktieb jinkludu, fost l-oħrajn, il-Prof. Hazel Barnes (l-Università ta' Ħaż-Żabbar), Rob Patternman (l-Università ta' Stellenbosch) u Yvonne Selip mill-Università ta' KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>Dan il-proġett beda fl-2009 u ħa ħafna mill-ħin tiegħi biex iġibu flimkien il-ħidma ta' l-awturi kreattivi b'mod eċċezzjonali.

The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Traskrizzjoni tal-ittestjar tal-effett tal-istokkors fuq il-Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus, fil-Bajja ta' Barnegat<br/><br/>Michael Franklin Marine Field Methods16 ta' Settembru 2008<br/><br/>I magħżula biex tuża l-crab blu, Callinectus sadius, għall-esperiment tiegħi minħabba li huwa abbundanti hawn fil-Bajja ta' Barnegat u huwa relattivament faċli għall-qbid.<br/><br/>Callinets sadius huwa a fniek tat-tbaħħir importanti għall-crasers soft-qoxra kummerċjali, kemm kummerċjali kif ukoll rikreattiv (Jivoff 2008) Metodu ewlieni tal-crabbing huwa nassa tal-cra bażika<br/><br/>It-traċċi tal-ospiti jseħħu meta nassa għadha ma tibqax tieħu organiżmi (Breen 1990) John Wnek jgħid li hemm faċilment 2,000 f'Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus tant aggressiva (Polck 1998) x'jiġri meta jiġġarbu b'xi ikel u x'impatt għandu dan?<br/><br/>Jekk maqbuda f'nassa ghost, C. sapidus se jkollhom tendenzi cannibalistic sa l-aħħar wieħed ikun miet barra mill-ġuħ.<br/><br/>Kif aħna tiddupplika nassa ghost fil-laboratorju?

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Kelma tal-Ġranet Real Estate tal-ġurnata: Għażla<br/><br/>Għażla: Ftehim għaż-żamma miftuħa, għal perjodu stabbilit, offerta ta' bejgħ jew kiri ta' proprjetà immobbli. Tista' tintuża għażla, pereżempju, biex tagħti l-ħin tax-xerrej biex isolvi mistoqsijiet dwar il-finanzjament, it-titlu, iż-żonar u l-fattibbiltà qabel ma jimpenja lix-xerrej jixtri. Għażliet ta' spiss jintużaw fil-proċess tal-assemblaġġ tal-art. L-għażla għandha tkun sostnuta mill-konsiderazzjoni attwali, separata u indipendenti tal-prezz tax-xiri tal-proprjetà. Is-sempliċi premessa ta' kunsiderazzjoni ma hijiex biżżejjed ħlief f'opzjoni ta' lokazzjoni li fiha d-dispożizzjonijiet tal-kirja huma stess korrispettiv suffiċjenti biex isostnu l-opzjoni. Opzjoni toħloq biss dritt kuntrattwali; ma tagħtix lill-opzjoni li tagħżel kwalunkwe proprjetà fil-proprjetà.Meta tiġi ffirmata l-opzjoni, is-sid ma jbigħx, u lanqas ix-xiri, il-proprjetà. Għalkemm is-sid huwa obbligat li jbigħ jekk jingħata avviż mix-xerrej, ix-xerrej mhuwiex obbligat li jixtri. Għażla għax-xiri hija magħrufa wkoll bħala sejħa; għażla għall-bejgħ hija magħrufa bħala put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Benefiċċji ta' l-Karotenoids għall-ġilda<br/><br/>Dawn il-kimiċi qawwija huma l-kostitwenti pigmented misjuba fil-pjanti li jagħtu fjuri, frott, u jħalli l-kuluri isfar, oranġjo u aħmar tagħhom.<br/><br/>Sa mis-snin 1930, ix-xjentisti identifikaw madwar 800 karboidrati u madwar 40 jinstabu fil-ġisem tal-bniedem, inkluż is-saff ta' barra tal-epidermidi, id-dermis u x-xaħam subkutanuż.
