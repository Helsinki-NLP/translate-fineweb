| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Permezz tas-serje tal-Bibbja C2000 għandna nbiddlu għall-ktieb ta' l-Atti, kapitolu wieħed, kif aħna tibda l-istudju tagħna tal-knisja bikrija.<br/>Luke, l-awtur tal-ktieb tal-Atti, kumpann ta' Paul l-appostlu, li kien awtur ukoll tal-Evanġelju skont Luqa, kiteb dawn iż-żewġ trattati lil xi ħabib, Theophilus, Theophilus huwa isem Grieg. Hemm xi wħud li jemmnu li ma kienx bniedem, imma li l-Evanġelju u l-ktieb ta' Atti ġew indirizzati lill-maħbubin ta' Alla, min int tista' tkun. Hemm tradizzjonijiet oħra li jgħidu li Theophilus kien fil-fatt il-kaptan ta' Luke, li f'dawk il-jiem it-tobba kienu skjavi, ġeneralment l-iskjavi ta' patrun tajjeb. B'hekk, il-kaptan ta' Luke kien Theophilus, u ħareġ lil Luke biex ikun ma' Paul fuq il-vjaġġi missjunarji. B'hekk, Luke reġa' jikteb lill-eks kap tiegħu. Dan huwa tradizzjoni bikrija tal-knisja, iżda huwa, ovvjament, impossibbli li wieħed jipprova, bħal ħafna mit-tradizzjonijiet.<br/>Hemm ukoll dawk li jemmnu li meta Pawlu kien fi Troas u hu rċieva viżjoni ta' bniedem li jgħidlu, " Come on the Macedonia u jgħinna," li l-bniedem fil-viżjoni ta' Paul ma kien xejn ħlief Luke. Għall-ewwel waħda li Pawlu verament ltaqa' meta wasal għall-Maċedonja ta' Ħal Luqa, u kif aħna fil-ktieb tal-Atti, se ssib li meta niġu għall-ewwel parti tal-ktieb tal-Atti, Luke jibda jikteb aktar fl-ewwel persuna aktar milli fit-tielet persuna. Għalhekk, f'dan il-punt partikolari fl-Atti tal-Appostli li Luqa sar kumpann ta' Paul u beda jivvjaġġa miegħu. Bed biex juża l-pronomi "aħna" u "na" minflok "huma" u "minnhom". Dan huwa, l-ebda dubju, fejn Luke sar parteċipant u xhud ta' dawk l-affarijiet li kienu qed jiġru minn dan il-punt. Aħna se nġibulek f'dan il-punt meta niġu għal dak il-punt.<br/>Huwa jibda l-Atti tal-Appostli billi jingħaqad ma' l-Evanġelju skond Luqa. Huwa interessanti li l-aħħar ħaġa li Luke jirreġistra fil-Evanġelju tiegħu hija l-ewwel ħaġa li jirreġistra fl-Atti tal-Appostli. Aħna nsibu l-Evanġelju tal- Luqa li jagħlaq hekk kif Ġesù qed jgħid lid-dixxipli tiegħu jistennew f'Ġerusalemm sakemm ikunu sfaw taħt il-poter mill-għoli u mbagħad Ġesù tela' fis-sema, u b'hekk jagħlaq il-Evanġelju. Fil-ftuħ tal-Atti tal-Appostli, jikteb,<br/>L-ewwel wieħed jittratta [jiġifieri, l-Evanġelju skont il- Luqa], kont nikteb lilek, O Theophilus, ta' dak kollu li Ġesù beda jagħmel u jgħallem (l-Att 1:1),<br/>Il-kelma ewlenija tibda. L-Evanġelju skond Luqa mhuwiex l-istorja sħiħa tal-Ministeru ta' Ġesù Kristu. Huwa biss il-bidu tal-ministeru ta' Ġesù Kristu. Ġesù għadu l-ministru għall-bżonnijiet tan-nies. Ġesù jkompli jgħolli l-mejtin.Ġesù jibqa' l-ministri għall-imħabba tiegħu u l-Evanġelju tiegħu għad-dinja, issa huwa biss ministru permezz ta' dawk id-dixxipli li ġew nominati mal-Ispirtu s-Santu tiegħu. Imma l-ministeru taʼ Kristu qed ikompli; bażikament, huwa l-premessa li Luke jieħu fl-Atti tal-Appostli.L-ewwel trattat taʼ dak kollu li beda Ġesù, kemm biex jagħmel kif ukoll biex jgħallem.<br/>Issa minħabba dan, l-Atti tal-Appostli huma ktieb mhux komplut: sa fejn il-Mulej għadu jaħdem permezz tal-ħajja ta' dawk li ddedikaw ruħhom bħala l-istrumenti ta' Alla. Biex tkun immexxia u ggwidata u nominata mill-Ispirtu s-Santu tiegħu, biex tkompli l-ministeru ta' Ġesù fid-dinja llum. Issa Alla organizza li x-xogħol tiegħu għandu jitwettaq permezz ta' strumenti umani. Alla jista' juża l-bnedmin bl-anġlu għax-xogħol tiegħu, u se jkun hemm żmien, matul il-ktieb ta' Rivelazzjoni meta Alla juża l-anġli biex jipproklama l-Evanġelju tiegħu għan-nies fid-dinja kollha. Rivelazzjoni, kapitlu 14, "L- ewwel anġlu li jtiru minn nofs is- sema kellu l- Evanġelju taʼ dejjem" (Riv 14:6). Imma fil-preżent Alla għażel li juża l-istrumenti tal-bniedem. Bħalma jistaʼ jkun imperfett, imma dak li Alla kellu l- żmien biex juża. Il- ħaġa eċċitanti dwar dan hi, Alla se jużani u Alla se jużak. Għalhekk, ħafna drabi, aħna qed jiġġeraw, "O Mulej, ma nistax ngħid. Qatt ma stajt nkellimni quddiem jew anke qabel, Mulej. "Bħal Mosè pprova noħroġ mis-sejħa t'Alla. Ġeremija qalet, "Mulej, jien biss gidi; l-ebda wieħed se jisimgħu lili., U aħna lkoll għandna skużi tagħna għaliex aħna ma tistax tintuża., Ma nafux ir-raġunijiet għaliex Alla ma setax jużana.<br/>Darba waħda, hekk kif il-Mulej kien qed jitlob profeta biex jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħu, hu qal, "Mulej, tibgħat lil min trid." Il-Mulej qal, "Hej, kont imsejħa int." Mulej, idea tajba; Ibgħat lil min trid." Ħafna drabi ninsabu f'din il-pożizzjoni, "Mulej, jibgħat bl-idejn ta' kull min inti se, xi ħadd imma lili Mulej." U madankollu, Alla ikkmandana li nużawna.<br/>Issa, kull wieħed minna jista' juri l-imperfezzjonijiet tagħna stess. Kull waħda minna tista' tindika l-inabbiltà tagħna stess, u lkoll tista' ssib skuża għaliex Alla ma jridx jużani. Iżda, Alla għażel li jużak. Li tul il-ħajja tiegħek Hu jista' jiżvela lilu nnifsu f'dinja bżonn. Tistaqsi meta Alla għandu strumenti bħal dawn biex juża kif qatt ma kiseb l-impjieg li sar, m'għandekx int?<br/>Sal-jum li fih kien ħa, wara li permezz tal-Ispirtu s-Santu kien ta l-kmandamenti tiegħu lill-appostli li kien għażel (l-Att 1:2):<br/>Dak li temm l-Evanġelju ta' Luqa b'dak il-jum, Ġesù ħa, wara li qal lill-appostli, biex jistennew it-tkabbir tal-poter.<br/>Lil min hu wkoll [li hu l-appostli] wera lilu nnifsu ħaj wara l-passjoni tiegħu [jew il-mewt] b'ħafna provi infalli (l-Att 1:3),<br/>Huwa diffiċli li niċħad mill-irxoxt ta' Ġesù Kristu, kif ukoll midneb u irritat, minn artiklu li qrajt fir-Reġistru Santa Ana f'dan l-aħħar Sibt. Ix-xjenza tal-ħolqien u t-teoriji evoluzzjonarji jiġu ppreżentati fl-iskejjel tal-kontea, kif dan il-professur wieħed qal li tgħallem klassi tax-xjenza, u b'hekk jittrattaw biss fil-fatti, u li m'għandhom l-ebda post għat-teoriji. Minħabba li x-xjenza hija bbażata fuq il-fatt u l-ħolqien hija bbażata fuq stivi reliġjużi, tieħu ħafna fidi biex temmen it-teoriji reliġjużi.Meta tkun qed tittratta l-fatti, tista' taċċettahom biss. Ħsibt, "Ħafna interessanti f'dik il-klassi tax-xjenza, huma mgħallma li kien fatt li d-dinja kien erba' biljuni snin qodma. Issa llum qed jgħallmu huwa fatt li d-dinja hija 12-il biljun snin qodma. U ma kienx dak twil ilu li mar l-iskola."<br/>Huwa interessanti li l-Bibbja qatt ma kellha tiġi riveduta jew aġġornata biex tissodisfa d-data attwali li l-irġiel ikunu skopra. U għadhom, jekk inti se tieħu tiegħi kotba tax-xjenza tal-iskola għolja illum u jippruvaw jgħallmu klassi tax-xjenza minnhom, inti ssib li ħafna mill-affarijiet li kienu mgħallma bħala fatt xjentifiku meta I kien fl-iskola għolja m'għadhomx rikonoxxuti bħala fatt xjentifiku. Il-protoplażma sempliċi taċ-ċelloli m'għadhiex ċellula sempliċi, iżda estremament kumplessa.Jekk hemm xi fatt li jista' jiġi ppruvat fl-istorja huwa l-fatt tal-irxoxt ta' Ġesù Kristu mill-mejtin.<br/>Għandna sistema ta' ġurisprudenza li hija bbażata fuq ix-xhieda tax-xhieda. Jekk raġel jiġi akkużat b'reat u hemm nies li raw dak ir-reat waqt li kien qed isir, u huma jinġiebu fl-istandard, u jaħlef li jirrakkonta l-verità kollha, u xejn ħlief il-verità, u b'hekk jgħinhom Alla. U fil-mistoqsija tagħhom jaffermaw li, "I raw li l-bniedem fil-bank fuq it-tielet u t-tielet ta' Mejju, I rawh joħroġ pistola mill-kisja tiegħu., Jien smajt id-domanda tiegħu li l-flus kollha jingħataw lilu. I raw lilu bħala ħalla l-bank. Jien rajtu bħala l-uffiċjal li deherlu barra.” U jekk tista' tikseb tliet xhieda jew erba' lil dak il-bniedem u se żżomm ix-xhieda tiegħu taħt eżami trasversali, dak il-bniedem jitqies ħati. Għandna żewġ xhieda jew tliet xhieda li qed jixhdu l-istess storja dwar dak il-bniedem, u huwa aċċettat bħala fatt li huwa dak li wettaq ir-reat u li huwa ħati., Inti ħadt ix-xhieda li kiteb li tgħid il-verità li qed tivverifika.<br/>Wara l-mewt ta' Ġesù, meta telaʼ għal darb'oħra, deher lil ħafna nies differenti li taw xhieda ġuramentati li rawh. U deherlu f'diversi postijiet f'ċirkostanzi differenti. U għal perjodu ta' erbgħin jum kien qed iżuruhom. U f'ħin wieħed, sa kemm ħames mitt persuna kienu miġbura f'post wieħed, deher. Huwa diffiċli li biss twarrab jew tiċħad ix-xhud ta' dawn in-nies. Biex nagħmlu dan huwa li niddividw is-sistema kollha tal-ġurisprudenza tagħna. Imma mhux biss dak, dawn l-irġiel li kienu jixhdu li raw il-Mulej żdied, li huma tkellimt miegħu, li jieklu miegħu, ilkoll, bl-eċċezzjoni taʼ xi ħadd, iltaqaʼ b'mewt vjolenti f'idejn nies oħra minħabba li kienu qed jaffermaw li l- istorja tagħhom kienet vera. Tkellem dwar ix-xhieda ġuramentati biex tgħid il-verità, il-verità kollha, xejn imma l-verità. Jekk il-ħajja ta' persuna kienet mhedda minħabba dak ix-xhud, u kienet gidba, tal-inqas wieħed minnhom kien ikun miksur taħt il-pressjoni. Huma kienu jkunu konfessati għall-hoax kollu. " Hu wera lilu nnifsu ħajjin wara l-passjoni tiegħu minn ħafna provi infalli."<br/>li huma meqjusa minnhom għal erbgħin jum, u jitkellmu magħhom dwar l-affarijiet li jappartjenu għas-saltna ta' Alla (l-Att 1:3:<br/>Xi kultant aħna niddejjaq lid-dixxipli minħabba l-mistoqsijiet tagħhom dwar iż-żmien tas-Saltna t'Alla. Ejja niftakru li s-Saltna t'Alla kienet is-suġġett favorit ta' Ġesù Kristu. Hu kien dejjem qed jitkellem dwar is-saltna t'Alla, u huwa tama kbira li kien qed iħajru fil-qlub ta' l-irġiel kollha. Affarijiet mhux dejjem se jkomplu korrotti kif huma. Id-dinja mhix se tmur għal dejjem taħt il-qawwa tad-dlam, taħt il- bondage ta' ħażen.Alla se jum wieħed jistabbilixxi saltna tiegħu fuq l-art. renju ta' ferħ u paċi ġusta. Ġesù għandu jsaltnu, fejn ikun il-ħalq tax-xemx, il-vjaġġi suċċessivi tiegħu jseħħu. U s-Saltna tiegħu se testendi minn max-xatt għal fuq ix-xatt.” U dak il-jum se jkun l-aktar jum glorjuż fid-dinja qatt rat, bħala mard u tbatija u uġigħ se jiġu aboliti fis-saltna tiegħu. Bħalma huma d-dnub u l-greeded u dawn l-affarijiet li għamlu d-dinja post intollerabbli se jiġu aboliti fis-Saltna tiegħu. Il-kummerċiżmu ta' l-allat, l-isfruttament tal-bniedem, dawn l-affarijiet kollha aboliti fis-saltna glorjuża tiegħu meta hu reigns.Ebda ma nistaqsi lid-dixxipli kienu ansjużi biex naslu għaliha. Jien ħerqana li nidħol għas-saltna tiegħu. U Ġesù qalilna meta nitolbu, l- ewwel petizzjoni hi, “is- Saltna t'Alla se ssir fl- art, kif inhi fis- sema” (Mattew 6:10). Dan hu t-tip tajjeb taʼ xewqa li għandna lkoll li jkollna. U għalhekk kien qed jitkellem magħhom, matul dan il-perjodu ta' erbgħin jum, tas-Saltna.<br/>U, billi għaqqadhom flimkien, hu kkmandahom li m'għandhomx jitilqu minn Ġerusalemm, iżda stenna għall-wegħda tal-Missier, li, saith hu, smajt miegħi (l-Att 1:14).<br/>Hu qal, "Issa, stenna hawn f'Ġerusalemm sakemm tirċievi l-wegħda tal-Missier." Din il-wegħda li Hu qed jirreferi hija, l-ebda dubju, il-wegħda f'Joel fejn il-Mulej wiegħed, "U għandu jidħol fil-jiem l-aktar tard, saith il-Mulej, li se nferra l-Ispirtu tiegħi fuq il-laħam kollu; u wliedek u bniet tiegħek se jifred, u l-irġiel żgħażagħ għandhom ħolm, l-irġiel qadim tiegħek għandhom jaraw il-viżjonijiet: u fuq l-qaddejja tiegħi u l-qaddejja tiegħi għandhom I jitferrqu l-Ispirtu tiegħi (Joe 2:28-29). Il-wegħda tal-Missier: il-ġurnata se toħroġ meta Alla se jferrħu l-Ispirtu tiegħu fuq il-laħam kollu, kull wieħed, jirċievi dak dinamiku mingħand Alla.<br/>Għal John [Hu qal,] tgħammed tassew bl-ilma; imma int se tkun mgħammda bl-Ispirtu s-Santu mhux ħafna jiem minn issa (l-Att 1:5).<br/>L-idea tal-magħmudija kienet dik ta' immersjoni, il-baptedzo. John tgħammed bl-ilma, mgħaddsa fin-nies fl-ilma, "inti ser tkun mgħaddsa fl-Ispirtu s-Santu f'ħafna jiem."<br/>Issa meta ġew hekk flimkien, huma talbuh, u qalulu, Mulej, inti f'dan iż-żmien terġa' ddaħħal is-Saltna lill-Iżrael? (l-Att 1:6)<br/>Meta se tkun, Mulej? Meta wasal iż-żmien għal din ir-restawr?" U Ġesù qed jitkellem dwarhom issa, mhux dwar is-saltna, imma dwar is-setgħa li qed jirċievu għan-notifika.U għalhekk huwa xkupilji apparti l-mistoqsija tagħhom.<br/>Meta tgħidilhom, M'hemmx għalfejn tkun taf il-ħin jew l-istaġuni, li l-Missier ikun poġġa fil-poter tiegħu stess (l-Att 1:7).<br/>Mhux għalik li tkun taf." Huma għexu kontinwament fl-antiċipazzjoni ta' l-istabbiliment immedjat tas-saltna. Matul il-ħajja kollha ta' Ġesù, huma kienu jistennew lilu fi kwalunkwe mument biex tmur fil-kabina tat-telefown u toħroġ bħala l-savior tad-dinja. Shamam! Li juri l-qawwa tiegħu u jsaqqa' lill-gvernijiet tad-dinja, li jistabbilixxi s-Saltna t'Alla fuq l-art. U kienu qed jistennew kuljum għal din il-bidla biex isegwuha. U kull meta Ġesù jitkellem dwar Ġerusalemm, u jmur f'idejn il-bniedem qaddis, u mbagħad jiġi msallab, "Oh, oh no, Mulej. Le, m'għandekx tifhem is-saltna, Mulej. Kun dak il-bogħod minneK." Meta miet Ġesù fuq is-salib, dawn kienu kollha diżappuntati ħafna.<br/>Iż-żewġ dixxipli fit-triq lejn Emmaus, u għalhekk imdejjaq. Kif tiġi daqshekk imdejjaq daqs il-mixi tiegħek?” "X'se tfisser? Għandek tkun barrani madwar hawn jekk ma tafx l-affarijiet li kienu qed jiġru tard f'Ġerusalemm." "X'affarijiet?" Ġesù qal: "Oh, li kien iħobb b'isem Ġesù ta' Nazaret... oh bniedem, kien miti u b'saħħtu. Il-ħatra ta' Alla kienet fuq ħajtu tiegħu. Aħna ttamajna li f'Alla kien il-kunsinna tal-Iżrael, imma huma kienu msawra fuqu. Issa wasal iż-żieda, u Hu qal, "F'xi ġranet, sħab, int se tirċievi l-wegħda tal-Missier."Oh, x'wegħda? Il-wegħda tal-istabbiliment tas-saltna?" Int tara, kien leġittimu li dawn għandhom jistaqsu. "Huwa dan il-Mulej? Hija din id-darba?Mhux biex tkun taf dak iż-żmien li l-Missier maħtur jew li l-Missier għandu fil-poter tiegħu stess. Iżda, int se tirċievi l-poter meta l-Ispirtu s-Santu ġie fuqek.”<br/>Issa hawn, l-epi prepożizzjoni Griega tintuża biex tiġi ffirmata relazzjoni ġdida li kellhom bl-Ispirtu s-Santu. Fl-Evanġelju ta' Ġwanni, kapitlu 14, kif Ġesù qed iwiegħed li jibgħat l-Ispirtu s-Santu, qal, "Mhux se tħallik bla heda. I se jgħidlek, u I se jitlob lill-Missier, u Hu se jibgħat lilek comforter ieħor, anke l-Ispirtu tal-Verità li d-dinja ma tistax tirċievi għaliex ma tarahx la jaf lilu, imma inti taf lilu għal hu jgħammar miegħek, u huwa għandu jkun fik" (Ġwanni 14:17-18). L-istess pożizjoni Griega bħal tagħna, biss huma jespliċitawha "en" minflok "f'relazzjoni ta' żewġ darbiet hemm fi Ġwanni: huwa miegħek, iżda huwa għaddej biex tkun abitazzjoni fik. Imma issa Ġesù qal li int ser tirċievi l-poter meta l-Ispirtu s-Santu jiġi miegħek. L-ep tal-pożizzjoni Griega, li hija tradotta f'testi differenti matul it-Testment il-Ġdid bħala "fuq" jew "fuq" jew I simili, "overflows."<br/>Fis-sebaʼ kapitlu tal- Evanġelju taʼ Ġwanni: “Fl- aħħar ġurnata, il- jum il- kbir tal- festa li Ġesù kien hemm fuq il- Muntanja tat- Tempju u ġiegħel lin- nies, 'Jekk xi ħadd jorqodu lilu jiġi f'Mi u jixorbu: u min xorb taʼ l-ilma li nagħti, mill- kważi se jkun hemm torrenti taʼ l-ilma li ngħix.” John qal: "Dan il-kelliem Hu tal-Ispirtu, li għadu ma ngħatax lil min jemmen fuqu għandu jirċievi" (Ġwanni 7:37-39). X'kellu l-Ispirtu? I simili, "Meta l-Ispirtu jtawwal inti," fuq inti, jew fuq inti, jew overflows mingħandek. Mela r-relazzjoni ta' tliet darbiet: Huwa miegħek qabel il-konverżjoni tiegħek, huwa dak li jikkawżalek tirrealizza li int sinner, huwa dak li jindika lil Ġesù Kristu bħala t-tweġiba li jikkonvinċi d-dinja tad-dnub, tal-ġustizzja, u tas-sentenza. Il-mument li tqatta' l-ħajja u l-qalb tiegħek lil Ġesù Kristu u tistedinh biex tidħol fih, l-Ispirtu s-Santu jiġi u jibda jiekol lilek. Huwa għandu jkun fik. Ma tafx li int m'intix tiegħek, int kienu mixtrija bi prezz, għalhekk jigglorifika Alla fil-ġisem tiegħek u l-ispirtu tiegħek li huma Tiegħu. U taf għadhom ma li l-ġisem tiegħek huwa t-tempju ta' l-Ispirtu s-Santu li huwa fil inti? Ma jkunx sakra ma' l-inbid, fejn ikun żejjed, iżda jimtela, jew ikun għadu mimli bl-Ispirtu” (1C 619-20, Eph 5:18). Imma issa hawn relazzjoni ta' l-enerġija.<br/>Inti ser tirċievi [id-danus] id-dinamika, meta l-Ispirtu s-Santu ġie fuqkom [jew fuqek, jew meta jkun hemm dan il-qlib minnkom]: u s-se jkun hemm xhieda miegħi (l-Att 1:8)<br/>U hekk id-dinamika, li tkun xhud ta' Ġesù Kristu, hu interessanti li x-xhud il-kelma bil-Grieg huwa l-kelma li ġejja minn fejn aħna nġibu lil martira kelma tagħna. U fil-Grieg dan ifisser martri. Xhud huwa wieħed li mhux biss jipproklama dak li hu jemmen, huwa dak li hu jemmen, u hu jemmen hekk b'mod qawwi, li jekk meħtieġ, se jmutu għal dak li hu jemmen. Ma tistax tieqaf lilu. Hu ma jibżgħux imutu għal dak li hu jemmen.<br/>Int tiftakar meta Pawlu reġa' lura f'Ġerusalemm u f'Agabus ħareġ minn Ċesea u ħa l-girdir ta' Pawlu u marid lilu nnifsu u qal, “U hekk hu l-bniedem li għandu dan il-firda li jkun marbut meta jasal f'Ġerusalemm.” U l-ħbieb ta' Paul bdew iweep, qal, "Oh, Paul, ma jmorrux, ma jmorrux." U qal, "X'tagħmel inti tfisser minn dawn id-dmugħ?, Taħseb li int se tiddiswadini? "Jien lest li tmut." Qed tpoġġi f'mewt għall-fidi tiegħek ma għamiltx martir; għax kont martri, int ġejt imwiegħed għall-mewt. Minħabba li kont xhud, għax temmen li tant b'saħħtu. Għalhekk, ma għamiltx xhud, prova biss x'kont kont.Jekk ma kontx xhud flimkien maʼ martus, qatt ma kont lura għall-mewt tiegħek; kont qed tgħid, "Whoa, whoa, stenna. F'dan il-każ, ejja nibdel il-kors hawnhekk. Naħseb li stajt għamilt żball." Imbagħad ngħid, "Well, ma kienx xi martus. Stealing a żiemel ma jtik ħalliel taż-żwiemel; huwa prova biss li inti kienu int. L-ebda wieħed steals żiemel sakemm ma kienx ħalliel taż-żwiemel. Allura, jisirqu li ma tagħmilx ħalliel taż-żwiemel, prova biss li inti kienu martir tul iż-żmien kollha. U int se tkun xhud biss. "U ma tkunx interessanti li l-biċċa l-kbira tagħhom kienu miżżewġin? "Xiemjiet unto Me."<br/>Ix-xhud kellu jkun it-tnejn f'Ġerusalemm, u fil-Lhudija kollha (l-Att 1:8),<br/>Ix-xhud beda d-dritt id-dar.L-iktar post diffiċli, mhuwiex?Huwa li nibdew id-dritt f'dar f'Ġerusalemm, u mbagħad iż-żona ta' Ġerusalemm, iż-żona ta' Ġuda. U mbagħad kien li nfirxet f'Samia. U mbagħad kien li jmorru fil-partijiet l-aktar estremi tad-dinja., U kif aħna jistudjaw il-ktieb ta'l-Atti, se naraw din il-progressjoni ħafna. U mbagħad se naraw kif bdiet tinfirex minn Ġuda. U mbagħad il-Phill kien ilu Samaria, u mbagħad fl-aħħar Pawlu u Barnabas huma msejħa biex jmorru fil-partijiet l-aktar estremi tad-dinja. U għalhekk ix-xhud ixerred permezz tal- annotazzjoni u l-għoti tas-setgħa ta' l-Ispirtu s-Santu.<br/>Issa meta kien tkellem dwar dawn l-affarijiet, filwaqt li beheld, kien ġie adottat; u sħabu waslulu mill-vista tagħhom (l-Att 1:9).<br/>Din hija l-wegħda finali magħmula minn Ġesù lid-dixxipli tiegħu, jiġifieri l-kliem finali qabel l-adeżjoni tiegħu.M'għandniex xi ngħidu, aktar tard, Hu ġie u tkellem lil Pawlu u lil oħrajn, imma qabel l-aċensjoni tiegħu, din hija l-kelma finali tiegħu. U fuq dan, meta kien tkellem lil dawn l-affarijiet, filwaqt li kienu qed jaraw lilu, kien ħalaq u sħabu rċievah mill-vista tagħhom.<br/>U filwaqt li kienu qed ifittxu b'mod kostanti lejn is-sema hekk kif marru, behold, kien hemm żewġ irġiel li kien minnhom fl-ilbies abjad (l-Att 1:10);<br/>Aħna nassumu li kienu anġli.<br/>Dak li qal ukoll, Ye l-irġiel tal-Galilija, għala għadu qed jingħafas fis-sema?, dan l-istess Ġesù, li huwa mkompli minnkom fis-sema, għandu għalhekk jiġi b'dak il-mod kif rajtu fis-sema (l-Att 1:11).<br/>Huma rawh bħala Hu tela' fis-sema u jerġgħu jżommuh meta jiġi. "Għandu l-fidi tal-Mulej b'għaxar eluf ta' qaddisin tiegħu, biex iwettqu ġudizzju fuq l-art" (Ġud 1:14-15). U mbagħad, "U lilu li jħobbna u tana lilu nnifsu u li għamelna lil Alla tagħna, slaten u qassisin li għandhom reign miegħu fuq l-art, żommu l-kometa tal-Mulej, u kull għajn għandha tara lilu, u huma wkoll li mtaqqba lilu għandhom rawnd" Rev 1:5-7). Allura x-Xhieda tal-Mulej għandhom jarawh. Ix-Xhieda ta' Ġeħova jgħidu li diġà ġie, imma kien sigriet li ġej. Hekk kif kien biss id-dixxipli li rawh imorru, kien biss id-dixxipli, tax-Xhieda ta' Ġeħova li rawh lura. Imma Ġesù qal: "Jekk jgħidulek, 'Huwa daħal fis-sigriet u daħal f'kamra sigrieta ma jemmnux" (Mattew 24:26). Għalhekk trid tagħżel, temmen li Ġesù jew għalihom.<br/>"Dan l-istess Ġesù li jittieħed minnkom fis-sema, għandu għalhekk jiġi b'mod simili bħalma rajtu fis-sema."<br/>Issa hemm vers interessanti ħafna f'II John, vers Act 1:7, "Għal ħafna qerq jidħol fid-dinja li confess non li Ġesù Kristu huwa ġejjin fil-laħam."Li, sfortunatament, hija traduzzjoni fqira tal-Grieg. Għal dan il-prinċipju huwa preżenti tensjoni u għandhom jiġu tradotti "li ġejjin fil-laħam." Dawk li se jiċħdu li Ġesù Kristu qed jiġi fil-laħam.X'tgħid minnhom? "Dawn huma qattiela u antichrist. Ħares lejh, li ntilfu mhux dawk l-affarijiet li weġġejna, imma li nirċievu premju sħiħ.Għal min jaqsam u ma jirrispettax id-duttrina ta' Kristu, m'għandhiex Alla. Huwa jirrispetta d-duttrina ta' Kristu, kemm il-Missier kif ukoll l-Iben. U jekk ikun hemm xi wieħed mill-bieb tiegħek (fis-Sibt filgħodu) u ma jressaqx din id-duttrina, jirċievih mhux f'darek, u l-ebda offerta tajba miegħu. Għax hu li jitwieled lilu tajjeb hu parti mill-għemejjel ħażen tiegħu" (2Jn 1:7-11). Staqsihom mistoqsija waħda, "Hu Ġesù li ġejjin fil-laħam?" U biss jistaqsihom dik il-mistoqsija. U jekk jgħidu le, sempliċement ftakar dak li Ġwanni wissa int u dak li Ġwanni qallek. Jekk xi konfessjoni ma tkunx li Ġesù Kristu jkun ġej fil-laħam.” Taħseb meta kien mad-dixxipli u meta qal, " Agħtini xi ħaġa biex tieklu"? Hu qal, "Inti taf, spirti ma tiekolx; messi. Ara lili?" Għalhekk, dan l-istess Ġesù reġa' ġej bl-istess mod li fih rawh jidħol fis-sema. U jien, għal wieħed, nemmen li ġej dalwaqt.<br/>Imbagħad reġgħu lura lejn Ġerusalemm mill-Muntanja msejħa Oliver, li ġejja minn vjaġġ ta' ġurnata ta' Sibt [madwar żewġ terzi ta' mil]. U meta ġew f', dawn marru f'kamra ta' fuq, fejn hemm 'il fuq kemm Pietru, u Ġakbu, u Ġwanni, and Andrew, u Phillips, u Thomas, u Bartholomew, u Matthew, James l-iben ta' Alphaus, u Simon Zelotes, u Ġuda l-aħwa ta' James. U dawn kollha komplew b'talba u provvista, bin-nisa, u Marija l-omm ta' Ġesù, u bl-aħwa tiegħu (l-Att 12:14-14).<br/>Dan hu l-aħħar isem ta' Marija l-omm ta' Ġesù. F'dan il-punt u minn dan il-punt, ma hemm l-ebda referenza ulterjuri tagħha fl-Atti tal-Appostli jew fl-epissili. Xejn huwa msemmi fl-Iskrittura. Huwa sieket.<br/>L-aħwa tiegħu jkunu referenza x'aktarx għal Ġakbu u għal Ġuda u għal dawk l-aħwa l-oħra li kienu wlied Ġużeppi u Marija.<br/>Il-kamra ta' fuq hemm xi wħud li jgħidu li hija l-istess kamra ta' fuq fejn Ġesù kellu l-aħħar Super mad-dixxipli tiegħu. U madankollu, hemm oħrajn li jżommu f'din il-kamra li jinsabu fit-tempju, fejn il-knisja tal-bidu kienet issodisfata. Ħu l-għażla tiegħek.<br/>U f'dawk il-jiem Pietru kien f'nofs id-dixxipli, u qal, (l-għadd ta' ismijiet tagħhom flimkien kienu madwar mitt u għoxrin,) irġiel u ħut, dan l-Iskrittura għandu jkun hemm bżonn, li l-Ispirtu s-Santu bil-ħalq ta' David jitkellem qabel ma' Ġuda, li kien gwida għal dawk li ħadu Ġesù (l-Att 1:15-16).<br/>Hawnhekk għal darb'oħra, Pietru għadu l-istess awtopluttiv tiegħu. Huma qed jistennew fit-talb u l-provvista, u Pietru joqgħod u jgħid, "Flows, hemm Iskrittura li ltqajna sodisfatti." U taf li għaddej biex timxi 'l quddiem, "Ejja nikseb il-programm li jmorru; ejja mitfugħa lottijiet u sirt taf min se jieħu l-post ta'Juda."I do nħoss li Peter kien mill-ġdid fil-laħam, li manifestanti li n-natura spustuż li kien tiegħu. U naħseb li l-istorja futura tal-knisja fil-ktieb tal-Atti tindika dan. Jien interessat fil-fehim ta' Pietru tal-Iskrittura, kif qed jikkwota minn tant postijiet fit-Testment l-Antik. Peter ma manifesta ħafna għarfien tal-Iskrittura antiki tat-Testment li hija punt favur tiegħu.<br/>Innota li Pietru tattribwixxi lill-Ispirtu s-Santu dawk l-affarijiet li David kiteb. Għalhekk, "L-Iskrittura kollha tingħata bl-ispirazzjoni ta' Alla" (2Ti 3:16). Mhux parti mill-Iskrittura. Għax, jekk tgħidli dik il-parti ta' l-Iskrittura tingħata bl-ispirazzjoni ta' Alla, allura għandi nitolbuk, "liema partijiet huma bl-ispirazzjoni u liema partijiet m'humiex bi ispirazzjoni?" U mbagħad int l-awtorità li tgħidli x'parti nista' nemmen u x'inhi l-parti ma nistax nemmen. U l-minuta li Alla m'għadux l-awtorità imma int l-awtorità, jien f'inkwiet. Oqgħod attent minn dawk li jgħidu, "Well, inti ma tistax temmen kollha ta' l-Iskrittura." L-Iskrittura infushom jgħidu, "L-Iskrittura kollha tingħata bl-ispirazzjoni ta' Alla." U hawn, Luqa bil-miktub ta' dak li qal Pietru, jiddikjara li David kien fil-fatt il-kelliem għall-Ispirtu s-Santu. L-Ispirtu s-Santu, bil-ħalq ta' David, jitkellem dwar Ġuda.<br/>Għax kien hemm numru magħna, [huwa kien wieħed mit-tnax-il] li kien kiseb parti minn din il-ministeru. Imma issa dan il-bniedem kien jixtri qasam bil-premju tal-inkwiżizzjoni; u kien jaqa' taħt l-intestatura (l-Att 1:17-18),<br/>Huwa xtara l-qasam, il-kamp tal-plejer bħala Zachariah il-kapitolu tal-katidral jiddikjara.<br/>u li jaqgħu headlong, huwa jinfaqgħu taħt l-midst, u kollha ta' musrana tiegħu ggwidata (l-Att 1:18).<br/>Hemm dawk li jsibu diskrepanza fl-Iskrittura, minħabba li f'wieħed mill-Evanġelju aħna qalu li meta Ġuda ġie lura u ppruvaw jirritornaw il-flus, u qalu, "Hey, huwa l-problema tiegħek.Ma nistgħux nieħduha." U poġġih lura fit-teżor tat-tempju. Imbagħad ħalla hemm fuq l-art tat-tempju u ħareġ u marid lilu nnifsu. Hawnhekk Pietru jgħidilna li m'għadhiex u poppeda biss. U hemm dawk li jimmaġinaw diskrepanza. Sempliċi ħafna, huwa kompla fis-siġra biex hang innifsu, marbuta mal-ħabel madwar għonq tiegħu u marbuta mal-riġlejn u jaqbżu.U l-forza tal-waqgħa jew snapd il-ħabel jew kap tiegħu, u huwa waqa 'l isfel fil-kanun u biss kif hu qal hawn.<br/>Kien magħruf min-nies kollha li kienu jgħixu f'Ġerusalemm; b'tali mod li l-kamp jissejjaħ fl-ilsien tagħhom, l-Acedama, jiġifieri, il-qasam tad-demm. Għaliha nkiteb fil-ktieb ta' Salmi, ħalli l-ħabitat tiegħu jkun iddesolat, u ma tħalli l-ebda bniedem jgħammar fih: u l-isqof tiegħu ħa tieħu oħra (l-Att 1:19-20).<br/>Issa fir-realtà huwa jikkwota minn żewġ Salmi differenti hawnhekk. Mill-Psa 69:25, huwa jpoġġiha flimkien ma' Psa 109:8 u jqiegħed iż-żewġ flimkien li jsib dawn il- profeziji li jikkonċernaw lil Ġuda.<br/>Fejn ikun hemm dawn l-irġiel (l-Att 1:21)<br/>Issa hawn fejn qed ifittxu li xi ħadd jieħu post l-Juda biex ikun appostlu. Hawnhekk huma l-kwalifiki li kienu qed ifittxu f'dak iż-żmien.<br/>Fejn minn dawn l-irġiel li kkompaw magħna l-ħin kollu li l-Mulej Ġesù meta fi u barra minnna (l-Att 1:21),<br/>Issa int tiftakar f'ħafna dixxipli, li ħafna dixxipli tagħhom għażlu li jkunu appostli, u l- appostlu tal- kelma jfisser li wieħed jintbagħat.” Jew għażel tnax-il appostli, u għalhekk bagħatlu t-tnax-il gvern uman. Aħna għandna ħdax-il sena biss biex nieħdu post Ġesù, iżda għandna bżonn wieħed li ilu magħna l-waqt li mill-bidu ma' Ġesù.”<br/>Mill-mument li ġie mgħammrin minn Ġwanni, sal-jum li ħa minnu, wieħed għandu jiġi organizzat bħala xhud (l-Att 1:22).<br/>Għalhekk dawn kienu r-rekwiżiti li kienu qed ifittxu. Xi ħadd li kien madwar il-waqt.Mill-ħin tal-magħmudija ta' Ġwanni sal-bidu. U wieħed li ra l-Mulej żdied, u b'hekk seta' jkollu l-fatt tal-irxoxt, ix-xhieda tiegħu fil-fatt.<br/>Issa l-appostlu, aktar tard biex jasserixxi l-fatt li hu kien appostlu qal, "I ma rajtx il- Kristu li qed jiżdied?" Evidentement li kien wieħed mill-ħtiġijiet tal-appostlu. Xi ħadd talabni, "Hemm appostli illum?" Ma nafx. Ma naħsibx li hemm fl-istess sens li dawn kienu fit-Testment il-Ġdid. Surement m'hemm l-ebda llum li jista' juri x-xhieda tal-irxoxt kif għamlu.<br/>Huma ħatru tnejn, Ġużeppi appella lil Barsaba, li kien kunjom Justus, u Matthias. U talbu, u qalu, Thou, Lord, li jafu l-qlub tal-irġiel kollha, juru jekk ta' dawn iż-żewġ li għażiltx (l-Att 1:23-24),<br/>Naħseb li ħafna drabi nagħmlu dan l-iżball li jagħti lill-Mulej żewġ għażliet, kemm ħżiena.Li tillimitaw Alla, tara. Aħna hekk suxxettibbli li nagħmlu dan. Ovvjament, Pawlu kien għażla t'Alla. Pietru kien imputtiv, u kien jaqbeż il-pistola qal, "Hey, konna ltqajna biex tagħmel xi ħaġa, inti taf, ltqajna għajnuna Alla out. Taf, wieħed nieqes u konna ltqajna biex timla lilu fi." U għadhom, "Alla, li wieħed minn dawn iż-żewġ ma trid?" U jagħti lil Alla ż-żewġ għażliet.<br/>Dan jista' jieħu parti minn din il-ministeru u minn dan l-appostlu, li minnu kien jaqa' l-ġurija mit-trasgressjoni, u għalhekk tah il-lottijiet tiegħu (l-Att 1:25-26);<br/>Mod interessanti li bih fittxew li jiddeterminaw ir-rieda t'Alla. Ejja nitfgħu d- dadi, sir af x'inhu r- rieda t'Alla hawnhekk. Huwa interessanti għalija, id-diversi modi li n-nies iddedukaw ir-rieda t'Alla. Issa, fil-ħinijiet antiki tat-Testment dawn kellhom mod interessanti li ġejjin lill-qassis, li kienet tistaqsi lill-Mulej għalihom permezz tal-Urimi u l-Ummim, id-"dwal u l-perfezzjonijiet." Biss dak li kienu dawn Urim u Thummim, aħna ma nafux. Jien ċert li ma kinux il-nuċċalijiet kkulurita li Joseph Smith sab magħhom it-Tabelli tad-Deheb; il-nuċċalijiet maġiċi, li meta tpoġġihom f'daqqa, tista' taqra l-kitba ġeroglifika.<br/>Hemm dawk li jgħidu li l-Umimu u t-Tummm kienu fil-fatt il-ġebel iswed u abjad li kien jintlibes f'borża fuq is-sider tal-qassis. Huma se jitolbu u jistaqsu lill-Mulej mistoqsija partikolari. Int tiftakar li David kien qed jitlob il-Mulej biex jiddefinixxi l-mistoqsijiet: "Mulej, aħna se jmorru kontra l-Filistini?" It-tweġiba kienet, "Nru." Għal darb'oħra, "Mulej, aħna jmorru kontra l-Filistini?" It-tweġiba kienet, "Iva "Meta għandna mmorru?" Huma se jistaqsu mistoqsijiet speċifiċi, u l-Mulej se jidderieġihom permezz tal-Urimi u l-Ummin. Huma jgħidu li l-qassis se jitlob, jitlob lil Alla, u mbagħad jilħaq f'waħda miż-żewġ ġebel.Jekk kien il-ġebla bajda, kienet tweġiba iva. Jekk ma kien l-ebda wieħed, ikun il-ġebel iswed li kien se iġbed. Xi wħud saħansitra jgħidu aħna jkollna t-terminu mballat minn dan l-Urimi u Thumm.Fil-fatt, lura fl-oriġinal huwa l-ebda vot kontra proġett jew idea partikolari. Biss dak l-Umimu u Thummim kienu, aħna ma jafux. Imma matul il-perjodu antik tat-Testment, huma kienu jużaw metodu ta' l-ikkastjar lottijiet biex jiddeterminaw ir-rieda ta' Alla.<br/>Għalhekk, hawn id-dixxipli qed jiġbru fuq l-istess ħaġa li qed jitfgħu d-decuju biex jaraw liema miż-żewġ sħab li Alla għażel li jissostitwixxi lil Ġuda Iskarjot.<br/>il-lott waqa' fuq Matthias; kien numru numerat bil-ħdax-il sena (l-Att 1:26).<br/>Issa li fid-dinja ma tantx tinstema' minnu qabel jew peress li qatt mhu ser ikun interessanti li tiltaqa' ma' Matthias u li jkun jaf x'inhu u x'jaħseb fl-istorja sussegwenti, huwa ovvju li Alla għażel lil Pawlu bħala appostlu. Pawlu jiddikjara lilu nnifsu. Issa dan huwa l-aħħar darba li dejjem naqrawhom li jfittxu li jagħrfu r-rieda t'Alla mill-ikkastjar ta' lottijiet jew minn tip ta' ħaġa.<br/>Naf li llum ukoll, biex infittex li niddistingwu r-rieda tal-Mulej, nitlob u jitlob lill-Mulej mistoqsija. Huwa ser ikollhom għaxar pennies fil-but tiegħu, u kif qed jitlob, huwa ser tieħu l-pennies ma' l-għajnejn tiegħu magħluq u tpoġġihom fuq il-mejda, u jekk dawn kollha jiġu l-irjus, huwa iva. Ħaġa interessanti, kull darba filwaqt li, dawn ser kollha toħroġ kapijiet, u li pjuttost odds tajba., Madankollu, ma nsibu l-ebda mudell għal dan wara li l-Ispirtu s-Santu kien mogħti. Ladarba l-Ispirtu s-Santu ġie fuq il-knisja, allura l-Ispirtu s-Santu beda jitkellmu magħhom u diretti lilhom. U l-Ispirtu s-Santu qal, "Seperat unto me Paul u Barnabas għall-ministeru fejn tlabthom" (l-Att 13:2). U l-Ispirtu s-Santu bagħathom lura. Għalhekk, aħna nsibu l-knisja aktar gwidata b'mod dirett mill-Ispirtu s-Santu, ladarba ġie l-Ispirtu s-Santu, dan jitfa d-decuju biex issir taf ir-rieda t'Alla ġiet annullata.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Verżjoni<br/><br/>Dan huwa l-verżjoni 1769 King James tal-Bibbja Mqaddsa (magħrufa wkoll bħala l-verżjoni awtorizzata).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this ...<br/><br/>Click to expand...<br/><br/>But you are correct that a headphone driver can work as a "low quality" mic. In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

L-oppożizzjoni ta' Stalin fi ħdan il-parti, inkluż il-Bukharin, Yagoda u Rykov, inħalqet f'dawn il-provi, peress li Stalin b'mod manipulattiv ġiegħlu jħawwad ma' reati ta' ppjanar ta' kolp u kontra l-istat, anki jekk ma kienx hemm prova. Gor T Rittersporn qal li "ħafna mill-vittmi ġew iddevjati sinċerament għall-prinċipji ta' Bolshevism." Dan il-prova t'hawnhekk juri li l-Bolshevik ideals li darba kienu l-għeruq tal-Partit Komunista kienu qed jiġu żarmati u meqruda mill-Purges.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell huwa ferment brawlers minflok setgħat star. kont fl-istaġun 750 bl-enerġija 8 nit u huwa diffiċli ħafna li jmorru passat li, bħal, poteri star jilagħbu rwol verament dominanti.

Huma jindikaw il-ħila tat-timijiet li inti qiegħed magħhom., U jien multa bil-logħob kontra l-brawlers livell ogħla, iżda meta tim wieħed huwa kollha 10 u t-tim l-ieħor mhuwiex, b'mod ċar mhuwiex żbilanċ.<br/><br/>Nirrikmandaw li jkollna xi ħbieb tajba jilagħbu ma', lili u ħbieb 2 ltqajna ħbieb tiegħi qawwa 1 biljett li jikklassifikaw 28 billi tilgħab gem grab ma' ċertu kompożizzjoni kuljum u għamilna mingħajr wieħed minna tkun maxed mal-brawlers tagħna.<br/><br/>Naf kif tħossok I użati li jkollhom brawlers fit-trofej b'livell baxx u huwa diffiċli li jmorru aktar u dak kollu li kien qal lili "I jkollhom poteri stilla" verament supercell jeħtieġ li jagħmlu bilanċ mas-setgħat stilla jew jagħmlu mill-inqas sistema ta 'tlaqqigħ aħjar.<br/><br/>I kinda tħoss dan., I ain ma bħala tajba fil-logħba kif inti, iżda I ltqajna Emz 500 fil-poter 1 u l-logħba kien horrible., M'għandix jgħinu li l-maġġoranza tal-timijiet tiegħi kellhom madwar 5-8k trofej... Kelli r-rikors li nuri l-aħħar minuta għaliex nista' jew ngħaqqad plejers li ma jissuspettax jew nilgħab sempliċement ftit aggressiv fil-ħinijiet it-tajba.

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Il-Parti 1 ta' l-Impjieg għal rasek<br/><br/>Meta taċċetta impjieg fi kwalunkwe organizzazzjoni, ikollok twettaq diversi impjiegi skont ir-rekwiżiti ta' min iħaddmek u tista' tikseb ammont fiss ta' dħul bħala salarju. Tista' tmexxi ħanut żgħir tal-bejgħ bl-imnut, billi tfassal il-ħwienet, ir-ristoranti, il-forn u l-ħelu, is-sbuħija tal-ħanut, eċċ fil-lokalità tiegħek. Tista' tinvolvi ruħha fil-kummerċ jew fil-manifattura fuq skala żgħira jew tipprovdi xi servizz għal prezz. Dawn l-attivitajiet ekonomiċi huma magħrufa bħala dawk li jaħdmu għal rashom.<br/><br/>It-tifsira ta' impjieg indipendenti<br/><br/>Qligħ huwa meħtieġ għal għixien. Missierna, omm, aħwa tagħna u oħrajn jistgħu jkunu involuti f'attivitajiet ekonomiċi differenti li permezz tagħhom jaqilgħu l-għajxien tagħhom. Dawn il-persuni huma involuti f'attività ekonomika li tiġi tterminata bħala impjieg fil-pagi jew f'impjieg bi ħlas, iżda hemm ħafna persuni li jwettqu xogħolhom jew xi negozju li jibdew u jmexxuhom waħedhom. Huma jqiegħdu fl-aħjar sforz tagħhom u jieħdu t-tipi kollha ta' riskji biex isegwu l-karrieri tagħhom b'suċċess.Il-qligħ kollu tax-xogħol tagħhom imur għalihom.L-utenti kollha raw ħwienet żgħar tal-merċa, ħwienet li jfasslu l-ikel, ħwienet mediċi eċċ fil-lokalità tagħna. Dawn huma proprjetà ta' u huma ġestiti minn persuna, bl-għajnuna ta' xi assistenti, jew mingħajru l-għajnuna ta' xi assistenti, l-attivitajiet ekonomiċi tagħhom huma meqjusa bħala li jaħdmu għal rashom.<br/><br/>Objettivi<br/><br/>Wara li tistudja din il-lezzjoni, tkun tista':<br/><br/>Xbieha ta' għanijiet<br/><br/>Xbieha ta' għanijiet<br/><br/>Karatteristiċi ta' l-impjieg għal rashom<br/><br/>Hija tinvolvi s-sjieda u l-ġestjoni ta' attivitajiet minn persuna għalkemm tista' tieħu l-għajnuna ta' persuna waħda jew tnejn biex tassistiha. Għalhekk, l-impjieg indipendenti jista' jipprovdi impjieg lil persuni oħra wkoll.<br/><br/>Il-qligħ minn xogħol għal rasek mhuwiex fiss. Dan jiddependi fuq id-dħul li wieħed jista' jaqla' billi jipproduċi jew jixtri prodotti jew jipprovdi servizzi lil oħrajn bi prezz.<br/><br/>F'xogħol għal rasek, is-sid waħdu għandu jieħu l-qligħ u jkollu r-riskju ta' telf. Għalhekk, aħna nsibu rabta diretta bejn l-isforz u l-premju f'xogħol għal rasu.<br/><br/>Dan jeħtieġ xi ammont ta' investiment kapitali, għalkemm jista' jkun żgħir.<br/><br/>F'xogħol għal rasek, persuna hija libera li tieħu deċiżjonijiet fir-rigward tat-tmexxija tan-negozju tagħha bi profitt u disponibbli ta' kwalunkwe opportunità li tista' tasal għall-espansjoni tan-negozju tagħha. Hija tagħti libertà kompluta għax-xogħol skont ir-rieda ta' dak li jkun u skont il-parametri tal-liġijiet prevalenti.<br/><br/>Għalhekk, l-impjieg indipendenti jista' jiġi definit bħala attività ekonomika li wieħed jista' jwettaq waħdu bħala xogħol bi qligħ, u dan jista' jikkonsisti fil-produzzjoni u l-bejgħ ta' oġġetti, ix-xiri u l-bejgħ ta' oġġetti, jew it-twassil ta' servizzi bi prezz. |
