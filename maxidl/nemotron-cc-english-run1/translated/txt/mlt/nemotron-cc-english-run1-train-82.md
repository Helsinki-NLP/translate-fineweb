In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR Ċertifikazzjoni Blog<br/><br/>Data: Lulju 23rd, 2014<br/><br/>Marda tal-kliewi interstizjali dominanti awtonoma hija ġabra rari ta' mard li jaffettwa l-funzjonijiet magħrufa tal-kliewi.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | V. Locke's Account dwar l-Istat tan-Natura<br/><br/>Suġġett: filosofija Words: 2539 Page: 9 Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes u Locke huma fost l-iktar filosfi politiċi influwenti għal dejjem jiktbu bl-Ingliż. L-istat tan-natura, li jippreċedi l-organizzazzjoni tas-soċjetajiet kumplessi, huwa l-post komuni li kemm il-Hobobs kif ukoll is-sehem ta' Locke, iżda jinterpreta b'modi differenti. L-ewwel wieħed iqis lill-bnedmin fl-istat naturali tagħhom bħala ugwalment perikoluża u liberi li jsegwu l-għanijiet artistiċi tagħhom mingħajr restrizzjonijiet fil-kunċetti ta' ġustizzja, li hija r-raġuni għaliex l-istat naturali tiegħu jammonta għall-“gwerra ta' kull bniedem kontra kull bniedem” (Hobbes76). Dawn tal-aħħar, min-naħa l-oħra, jaraw lill-bnedmin fil-kundizzjoni oriġinali tagħhom bħala ugwalment prezzjuża u jillimitaw il-libertà naturali mill-idea tal-ġustizzja li tirrikjedi li ma tagħmilx ħsara lill-oħrajn, li tippermetti d-definizzjoni tal-istat tan-natura bħala "assistenza reċiproka u preservazzjoni" aktar milli tal-gwerra (Locke 15). Id-differenza ewlenija bejn il-kontijiet tal-istat naturali taż-żewġ filosfi hija li Locke juża kunsiderazzjonijiet etiċi filwaqt li Hobbes ma jagħtix, u fl-aħħar mill-aħħar iwassal lil Hobbes biex jipprevedi stat li jeżerċita poter bla limitu fuq il-bnedmin, filwaqt li Locke jillimita lill-gvern mill-prinċipji morali, li hu jqis liġi naturali.<br/><br/>Hobbes jibbaża s-suppożizzjonijiet tiegħu dwar l-istat tan-natura fuq il-fatt li n-nies kollha huma bejn wieħed u ieħor ugwali fil-kapaċitajiet fiżiċi u mentali tagħhom. Huwa jammetti li xi individwi jistgħu juru aktar saħħa fiżika jew intellettwali superjuri iżda jinsisti li "meta kollox ikun magħruf flimkien, id-differenza bejn il-bniedem u l-bniedem mhix daqshekk konsiderevoli" (Hobbes 74). Peress li l-bnedmin huma bejn wieħed u ieħor ugwali fil-kapaċitajiet tagħhom, huma għandhom ukoll tama simili biex jiksbu t-truf tagħhom u jissodisfaw il-ħtiġijiet tagħhom (Hobbes 75). Bħala riżultat loġiku ta' din l-ugwaljanza, meta n-nies jibdew jikkompetu għal riżorsi skarsi, ħadd ma jista' jħossu li hu kompletament sigur fil-pussesss tiegħu. Anke jekk xi ħadd jista' jmut, jaħdem u kapaċi jirnexxi f'li jissuġġerixxi "l-persuni ta' kull raġel li jista'," xorta ma jiggarantixxix is-sigurtà aħħarija (Hobbes 75). Peress li l-ebda bniedem ma jista' jikseb din is-superjorità fuq l-oħrajn li jagħmilhom immuni għalih jew għall-qawwa ta' intellettwali, l-ebda bniedem ma jista' jħossu sikur għalkollox meta jkun imdawwar bl-istess daqs tiegħu jew tagħha. L-ugwaljanza ta' nies li jaħdmu fuq ix-xogħol fl-istat naturali hija l-ugwaljanza tal-biża', fejn il-bnedmin kollha jaraw lil xulxin bħala kompetituri perikolużi.<br/><br/>Biss bħala Hobbes, Locke jikkunsidra li l-bnedmin kollha huma fundamentalment ugwali, iżda jagħti tifsira differenti ħafna għat-terminu.Mill-perspettiva tiegħu, mhuwiex l-ugwaljanza tal-kapaċitajiet, iżda, pjuttost, l-ugwaljanza tal-valur. Huwa jiftaħ li n-nies "b'mod promettenti twieldu għall-istess vantaġġi tan-natura" għandhom loġikament igawdu l-ugwaljanza perfetta fosthom, peress li m'hemm l-ebda raġuni biex wieħed iqis lil xi ħadd b'mod inerenti aktar siewi (Locke 8). L-unika pedament possibbli għall-ħatra ta' xi nies bħala superjuri għal oħrajn ikun jekk Alla " bi kwalunkwe dikjarazzjoni ċara tar-rieda tiegħu, stabbilit fuq ieħor" (Locke 8). Peress li tali sanzjoni divina ta' superjorità hija nieqsa, Locke jikkonkludi li l-ugwaljanza naturali tar-rappreżentanti kollha tal-umanità ma għandhiex titqiegħed f'dubju. L- għanqbut approċċi ta' ugwaljanza b'mod pragmatiku u jenfasizza li n-nies fl-istat naturali tagħhom huma perikolużi bl-istess mod, iżda Locke juża approċċ etiku u jenfasizza li l-bnedmin huma ugwali f'għajnejn Alla. Dan in-nuqqas ta' qbil huwa iżda l-ewwel differenza bejn iż-żewġ awturi bbażata fuq il-fatt li Locke jinkludi lil Alla bħala post fil-filosofija politika tiegħu, filwaqt li Hobbes ma jagħmilx.<br/><br/>Karatteristika oħra tal-kont ta' Hobbes tal-istat naturali hija l-interpretazzjoni tiegħu tal-libertà. Skond Hobbes, l-istat tan-natura jimplika libertà bla limitu li tagħmel dak li hu meħtieġ għall-eżistenza kontinwa ta' dak li jkun. Il-filosfu tiddefinixxi l-libertà bħala "l-assenza ta' impedimenti esterni" fl-użu tal-kapaċitajiet ta' wieħed biex jilħaq l-għanijiet tiegħu (Hobbes 79). B'konsegwenza ta' dan, il-libertà ta' passatemp tammonta għal opportunità mingħajr xkiel li, fis-sentenza ta' wieħed, ikun l-aħjar adattat biex jippreserva l-ħajja u l-pussess ta' dak li jkun (Hobbes 79). L-unika limitazzjoni għal-libertà hija li persuna ma tistax tagħmel xi ħaġa kontradittorja biex issostni l-ħajja tagħha jew teqred "il-mezzi biex tippreserva l-istess" (Hobbes 79). Minbarra dan, m'hemm l-ebda fruntieri, u kulħadd għandu "dritt għal kollox, anke għal korp ieħor" jekk dan ikompli s-sopravivenza ta' xi ħadd (Hobbes 80). B'hekk, il-libertà naturali, kif osservat mill-Hobbes, hija n-nuqqas ta' ostakli esforzati esternament fit-twettiq tad-dritt ta' dak kollu li jsostni u jiżgura l-eżistenza kontinwa ta' dak li jkun.<br/><br/>Locke tilqa' wkoll l-idea tal-libertà naturali iżda, bla sorpriża, approċċi li huwa b'mod li huwa differenti b'mod sinifikanti minn dak ta' Hobbes. Hekk kif jibda jiddiskuti l-libertà fl-istat tan-natura, hu minnufih jinnota li stat ta' libertà ma jfissirx "stat ta' liċenzja" (Locke 9). Il-filosfi jidentifika żewġ limitazzjonijiet speċifiċi għal-libertà tal-bniedem fl-istat tan-natura. L-ewwel waħda hija identika għal din l-introduzzjoni mill-Hobbes: madankollu b'xejn u indipendenti, persuna madankollu "ma għandhiex il-libertà li teqred ruħha" (Locke 9). Madankollu, it-tieni limitazzjoni tikkontradixxi l-pożizzjonijiet ta' Hobbes direttament. Skond Locke, kull bniedem għandu obbligu naturali li ma' "il-ħsara oħra fil-ħajja tiegħu, is-saħħa, il-libertà, jew il-pussessi" (9). Bħal fl-interpretazzjoni tiegħu tal-ugwaljanza, l-awtur jibbaża din l-affermazzjoni fuq raġunijiet etiċi u reliġjużi: in-nies għandhom jippreżervaw l-eżistenza ta' xulxin peress li huma l-kreazzjonijiet kollha tal-istess "minopotent, u min-naħa l-oħra jagħmlu l-istess" (Locke 9). Għalhekk, il-limiti ta' Locke fl-istat naturali ferm aktar stretti minn Hobbes permezz tal-introduzzjoni ta' l-obbligu li ma jagħmlux ħsara kemm lil min hu stess kif ukoll lill-oħrajn.<br/><br/>Id-differenzi bejn iż-żewġ awturi wkoll manifesti fil-kontijiet tagħhom tal-ġustizzja fl-istat naturali tal-umanità. F'dak li għandu x'jaqsam ma' Hobbes, u l-prattiki ġusti u inġusti huma biss il-kwistjoni tal-liġi. Ma hemm l-ebda każistika fl-istat tan-natura, u l-unika liġi li tirregola l-bnedmin fil-kundizzjoni oriġinali tagħhom hija liġi naturali li tobbligahom biss li jfittxu sigurtà personali. B'riżultat ta' dan, xejn ma jista' jkun inġust fl-istat oriġinali tal-umanità: "kunċetti ta' ġustizzja u inġustizzja ħażina" ma għandhom l-ebda post u l-ebda tifsira fl-assenza tal-liġi infurzata b'mod strett (Hobbes 78). Sakemm in-nies jużaw il-libertà tagħhom mingħajr limitu virtwalment biex jikkompetu ma' xulxin għar-riżorsi, li huma intitolati għalihom b'mod ugwali, m'għandhom l-ebda kriterji biex jiddistingwu bejn azzjonijiet ġusti u inġusti. Għalhekk, l-istat ta' natura ta' Hobbes jiddefinixxi l-idea stess tal-ġustizzja peress li l-awtur jinterpretaha bħala sempliċi funzjoni tal-liġi formalizzata u stabbilita.<br/><br/>Locke tassenja tifsira differenti lill-ġustizzja u l-fehmiet tagħha mhux tant f'termini leġiżlattivi bħal fit-termini etiċi. Din id-dokument diġà semma li, b'differenza minn Hobbes, Locke juża kunċetti etiċi u ġeneralment jibbaża l-filosofija politika tiegħu fuq il-presunzjonijiet morali u purament prattiċi. B'riżultat ta' dan, il-liġi naturali ta' Locke, b'differenza minn dik ta' Hobbes, tobbliga lill-bnedmin jieħdu ħsieb lil xulxin aktar milli sempliċiment lil kulħadd iħossu lilu nnifsu. B'riżultat ta' dan, hemm post għall-ġustizzja u l-inġustizzja fl-istat tan-natura tiegħu. L-awtur jindika f'dan il-fatt innifsu meta jinnota li ħadd ma għandu jċaħħad lil ħaddieħor mill-ħajja tiegħu mill-mezzi ta' prevenzjoni tiegħu "sakemm ma jkunx jista' jagħmel ġustizzja fuq awtur ta' ksur" (Locke 9). Din id-dikjarazzjoni tiżvela l-akbar ċarezza li, skont Locke, hemm ġustizzja fl-istat tan-natura, u, barra minn hekk, il-bnedmin għandhom jippreżervawha b'mod attiv. Il-kriterju tal-ġustizzja, li l-istat naturali ta' Hobbes mhuwiex, huwa t-tieni limitazzjoni fuq il-libertà naturali imposta minn Locke: azzjoni hija inġusta jekk tikkostitwixxi theddida mhux ġustifikata għall-ħajja u l-pussess ta' persuna oħra.<br/><br/>Dawn id-differenzi fit-trattament taż-żewġ awturi tal-ugwaljanza, il-libertà u l-ġustizzja jew l-inġustizzja jwasslu għall-interpretazzjoni tagħhom tar-relazzjoni bejn l-istat tan-natura u l-istat tal-gwerra. Mill-perspettiva ta' Hobbes, it-tnejn huma sinonimi, minħabba li l-kompetizzjoni bla ħniena hija l-uniku riżultat loġiku tat-tqegħid ta' nies b'kapaċitajiet ekwivalenti u bi bżonnijiet simili f'ambjent b'riżorsi limitati. Huwa jgħid dan kollu konnessjoni: "jekk xi żewġ irġiel jixtiequ l-istess ħaġa, li madankollu ma jistgħux igawdu, huma jsiru għedewwa" u, għalhekk, fl-istat tal-gwerra ma' xulxin (Hobbes 75). Madankollu peress li l-bnedmin huma numerużi u kollha kemm huma kapaċitajiet u bżonnijiet simili, din il-kompetizzjoni manifesti mhux biss fl-interazzjonijiet individwali iżda wkoll fuq il-livell tal-umanità kollha kemm hi. Sakemm il-bnedmin kollha għandhom drittijiet ugwali u illimitat għar-riżorsi kollha u anke għall-korpi u l-ħajja ta' xulxin, l-istat tan-natura huwa gwerra ta' "kull bniedem kontra kull bniedem" (Hobes 76). Din l-interpretazzjoni ewlenija tirriżulta direttament mill-perspettiva tal-istat tan-natura ta' Hobbes kif irregolat biss mill-ġesti ġeopolitiċi tal-individwi.<br/><br/>Min-naħa l-oħra, id-differenzi bejn l-istat tan-natura u l-istat tal-gwerra u l-punti li, filwaqt li jistgħu jseħħu fl-istess ħin, m'hemm l-ebda raġuni biex wieħed jiġi identifikat mal-ieħor. Id-definizzjoni ta' l-istat tal-gwerra hija kważi identika għal dik offruta minn Hobbes. Skond Locke, "huwa min jipprova jikseb bniedem ieħor fis-setgħa assoluta tiegħu b'hekk ipoġġi lilu nnifsu fi stat tal-gwerra miegħu" (14). Din l-ispjegazzjoni tistabbilixxi perfettament mal-idea ta' Hobbes li d-dritt universali ta' kulħadd għal kollox, inkluż il-korpi u l-ħajja tan-nies l-oħra, iwassal għall-istat tal-gwerra. Però Locke jirrifjuta li jassimila l-istat tal-gwerra u l-istat tan-natura b'mod preċiż għax jiċħad l-interpretazzjoni tal-libertà naturali ta' Hobbes. Peress li l-istat naturali ta' Locke jrażżan lin-nies milli jagħmlu ħsara lil xulxin permezz tat-tieni limitazzjoni tal-libertà, tentattiv ta' libertà ta' persuna oħra huwa transgressjoni kontra l-liġi naturali. Filwaqt li għal Hobbes, il-gwerra hija l-kundizzjoni tal-umanità b'default, Locke juriha bħala perverżjoni ta' l-istat tan-natura aktar milli r-regola tagħha.<br/><br/>Dawn id-differenzi fid-determinazzjoni tal-istat fuq in-natura u l-kostitwenti tiegħu, bħal-libertà, l-ugwaljanza, il-ġustizzja, u l-gwerra, iwittu t-triq għall-awturi li jikkuntrastaw il-konsontali tal-gvern. Fuq il-bażi tal-valutazzjoni pessimistika tiegħu tal-istat tan-natura, l-awtur ta' Liathan jikkonkludi li, skont il-kundizzjonijiet tal-gwerra, ma jista' jkun hemm l-ebda tama definita għal "ħajja barra mill-ħin li n-natura normalment tħalli lill-irġiel jgħixu" (Hobbes 80). Is-soluzzjoni qed tistabbilixxi d-dritt universali għal kollox u tħalli lil kulħadd " tant libertà kontra l-irġiel oħra, peress li tippermetti lil ħaddieħor kontra lilu nnifsu" (Hobbes 80). Il-parteċipanti tal-kuntratt soċjali li jirriżulta jinvestu l-libertajiet bla limitu li jkunu ċedew f'setgħa sovrana – il-berġa tas-setgħa suprema li l-għan tagħha huwa li jinżamm l-istatus quo billi jiġu ssanzjonati t-tranżazzjonijiet kollha kontrih. Is-setgħa ta' Sovrana hija assoluta: il-ħakkiem għandu l-awtorità "biex jagħmel dak kollu li għandu jaħseb li hu meħtieġ" biex jippromwovi l-paċi bejn is-suġġetti tiegħu sabiex ħadd ma jassallaw il-ħajja jew il-proprjetà ta' ħaddieħor (113). It-trabi jikkonkludu li mingħajr din iċ-ċifra żejda, id-dritt li wieħed jagħmel xi ħaġa lis-suġġetti, ma jista' jkun hemm l-ebda serħan il-moħħ u l-ebda garanzija ta' sigurtà.<br/><br/>Filwaqt li Locke jaqbel mal-ħtieġa tal-ħolqien ta' soċjetajiet organizzati politikament, huwa madankollu jopponi l-idea tal-poter sovran bħala illimitat u u instabbli. Kif imsemmi hawn fuq, l-istat tan-natura ta' Locke mhuwiex kważi diffiċli daqs dak li pinġa mill-Hobbes minħabba l-obbligu tan-nies li jippreservaw mhux biss imma lil xulxin ukoll. Għalhekk, il-ħtieġa ta' kuntratt soċjali ma tirriżultax mill-biża' tal-oħrajn, iżda mill-konvenjenza enormi. Il-komunitajiet żgħar ma jistgħux ikollhom diversi liġijiet biex isolvu l-kunflitti u "l-uffiċjali biex jissorveljaw il-proċess", iżda assoċjazzjonijiet akbar isibuha rakkomandabbli li jibdew il-gvernijiet għal dak il-għan (Locke 57). Madankollu, is-setgħa tal-gvern ma tistax tkun illimitata għaliex twassal biex is-suġġetti jiġu sottoposti għal "persuna inkonstant, inċerta, rieda arbitrarja ta' bniedem ieħor" (Locke 17). Dan il-gvern jikkostitwixxi ksur doppju tal-liġi naturali. Billi taqbel mal-qawwa assoluta ta' persuna oħra fuq ħajjitha, suġġett jikser l-ewwel limitazzjoni tagħha li tipprojbixxi li tagħmel ħsara lil ħaddieħor. Fir-rigward tal-ħakkiem, l-qerda tal-libertà ta' persuna oħra tikkostitwixxi dannu dirett u, bħala tali, tkun kontradittorja fit-tieni limitazzjoni.<br/><br/>Bħala kontinwazzjoni diretta tal-każ tiegħu għal awtorità governattiva bla limitu, Hobbes jiċħad is-separazzjoni tal-poteri bħala prinċipju. Mill-perspettiva tiegħu, is-sovranità, ladarba tkun istitwita, tippossjedi “is-setgħa sħiħa li jippreskrivu r-regoli” li jirregolaw il-ħajja tas-suġġetti jew, f'termini iqsar, is-setgħa leġiżlattiva (Hobbes 114). Is-sovranità tirriżerva wkoll id-dritt ta' "seduta u tiddeċiedi l-kontroversji kollha" – jiġifieri, is-setgħa ġudizzjarja (Hobbes 114). Fl-aħħar nett, peress li l-għan sħiħ tas-sovranità huwa li s-suġġetti jibqgħu lura milli jagħmlu ħsara lil xulxin, ma jista' jkun hemm l-ebda dubju li s-setgħa eżekuttiva hija wkoll prerogattiva esklużiva tiegħu jew tagħha. Is-separazzjoni tal-poteri bħala kunċett hija aljena lil Hobbes minħabba l-fehmiet tiegħu dwar l-istat tan-natura. Il-ħolqien ta' entità politika fejn il-fergħat eżekuttivi, leġiżlattivi u ġudizzjarji jkunu se jikkontrollaw lil xulxin – jiġifieri, jikkompetu – ifissru li jinħoloq mill-ġdid l-istat ta' passatemp ta' natura-aswar fuq livell ogħla. Peress li n-nies jidħlu f'kuntratt soċjali u jiftħu gvern biex iweġġgħu lura l-istat tan-natura tagħhom, is-separazzjoni tal-fehmiet kontradittorji ta' Hobbes direttament.<br/><br/>Min-naħa l-oħra, is-separazzjoni tħaddan il-poter bħala prinċipju fundamentali tat-teorija politika tiegħu. Il-każ tiegħu għas-separazzjoni huwa evidenti fid-diskussjoni tal-limiti tas-setgħa leġiżlattiva. Hekk kif Locke ipoġġiha, bilkemm ikun rakkomandat "għall-istess persuni, li għandhom is-setgħa li jagħmlu liġijiet, li wkoll f'idejhom is-setgħa li jwettquhom" (76). Il-filosfu jindika l-imperfezzjonijiet tan-natura umana u x-xewqa inerenti li "jaqbad fil-poter" bħala raġuni għal din il-miżura kawtelatorja (Locke 76). Bħal fil-każ ta' Hobbes, il-kont ta' Locke tas-separazzjoni tal-poteri joħroġ direttament mill-interpretazzjoni tiegħu tal-istat tan-natura. Jekk diġà jkun hemm ġustizzja fl-istat tan-natura u n-nies ikunu jistgħu jifhmuha, kwalunkwe gvern ikun inevitabbilment soġġett għall-istess liġi naturali. Billi s-setgħa assoluta fuq in-nies tikser kemm il-limitazzjonijiet ta' din il-liġi, is-separazzjoni u d-distribuzzjoni tagħha huma rakkomandabbli sabiex il-gvern jiffunzjona b'mod xieraq.<br/><br/>Din id-dokument wera li, filwaqt li d-differenzi bejn il-kontijiet ta' Hobbes u ta' Locke tal-istat naturali tal-umanità huma numerużi, fl-aħħar mill-aħħar jammontaw għall-preżenza ta' assenza ta' bini morali. It-trabi jesprimu l-istat naturali bħala dak ta' libertà mingħajr limitu, fejn in-nies mogħnija b'kapaċitajiet ugwali u mhux marbuta b'xi kunċetti morali, bħall-ġustizzja, jikkompetu għar-riżorsi bla bżonn. Madankollu, iċ-ċaħda ta' responsabbiltà tinterpreta l-ugwaljanza u l-libertà b'mod etiku u mhux prattiku u tiddeċiedi li l-gwerra hija perverżjoni tal-istat naturali, peress li l-liġi naturali tobbliga lill-bniedem li ma jagħmilx ħsara lil xulxin. Dan in-nuqqas ta' qbil jinfluwenza l-approċċi tal-filosfi lejn il-gvern.Hobbes tinsisti fuq ħakkiem sħiħ, peress li, fin-nuqqas ta' trażżin etiku, l-ebda awtorità oħra ma tista' tisforza lill-bnedmin biex iżommu lura milli jagħmlu ħsara lil xulxin. Madankollu, fil-fehma ta' Locke, l-għoti ta' setgħat illimitata tal-gvern ikun kuntrarju għal-limitazzjonijiet etiċi inkorporati fil-liġi tan-natura, u għalhekk huwa favur, b'differenza minn Hobbes, is-separazzjoni tal-poteri. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Pulizija tal-moda: X'inhu l-logħba tal-Thrones throw up<br/><br/>Il-kantant Kanadiż tal-Franċiż Abbas Hasan għamel sforz biex ineħħi l-umanità kollha fil-Ġenna tal-moda 2014.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....

Bħala fenomenu mifrux fil-ħamrija, ir-replikazzjoni tal-ilma tal-ħamrija tbiddel il-funzjonijiet tal-ħamrija idrawliċi billi tirreżisti l-fluss tal-ilma fil-ħamrija. Barra minn hekk, il-proprjetajiet idrawliċi mhux biss jiddependu fuq is-sistema tal-ħamrija tal-pori iżda wkoll huma affettwati mill-proprjetajiet fiżikokimiċi tal-uċuħ tal-pori. Meta mqabbla mal-ilma, l-etanol mhuwiex affettwat mir-riċensjoni tal-ilma minħabba t-tensjoni tal-wiċċ inferjuri tagħha. L-għan tal-użu tal-etanol huwa li jiġi eliminat l-effett tar-ridipendenza tal-ilma tal-ħamrija fuq il-proprjetajiet idrawliċi. Madankollu, l-applikazzjoni ta' etanol pur fil-ħamrija tista' tiddegrada l-materjali organiċi tal-ħamrija u twassal għal bidliet fil-proprjetajiet fiżiċi. Għalhekk, is-soluzzjonijiet tal-etanol akweu jistgħu jkunu għażla alternattiva. Madankollu, il-fattibbiltà tal-użu ta' etanol milwi għad-determinazzjoni tal-kurva ta' żamma tal-likwidu tal-ħamrija tibqa' mhux magħrufa. Dan l-istudju għandu l-għan li jittestja l-fattibbiltà tas-soluzzjonijiet tal-etanol akweu (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % u 100 % v/v) għall-istabbiliment ta' kurva ta' żamma tal-likwidu taħt firxa żgħira ta' kampjuni tar-ramel li huma applikati f'għamla ta' gradilja u ħamrija organika (Tempju ċpar tal-kompost naturali, bijofarma, effluwent tal-ħalib, u kompost muniċipali, ir-rata ta' applikazzjoni kienet ta' 15 % skont il-piż). Ir-riżultat wera li d-depressjoni tal-ittestjar ta' soluzzjonijiet ta' etanol fl-ilma meta mqabbel ma' madwar 1 sa 3x ibbażata fuq il-kontenut likwidu fl-istess pressjoni applikata u l-ħin biex jintlaħaq kull ekwilibriju. Ir-riżultati mill-esperiment tar-ramel ssuġġerew li meta l-konċentrazzjoni ta' soluzzjoni ta' etanol fl-ilma kienet inqas minn 50 %, it-telf permezz tal-evaporazzjoni kien inqas minn 1% u d-differenzi relattivi bejn il-likwidu tal-ittestjar u l-ilma kienu inqas minn 10 %. Madankollu, it-telf ta' evaporazzjoni kien ta' 11.06 % u 24.6 %, u d-differenzi relattivi kienu kollha madwar 15 % u 30 % f'soluzzjoni ta' 50 % u 100 % etanol, rispettivament. B'kuntrast ma' dan, l-emendi organiċi fil-forma ta' Tempju tal-fidda mhux biss żied il-kapaċità taż-żamma tal-ilma iżda naqqsu wkoll it-telf ta' evaporazzjoni. It-telf mill-evaporazzjoni fil-ħamrija TSL u t-TSL b'emendi organiċi kien ta' 1 % f'soluzzjonijiet b'inqas minn 50 % tal-kontenut tal-etanol.
