| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | Konklużjoni: Bl-użu ta' elmi tat-tkessiħ għall-ġlieda kontra l-Korrimenti fil-Kulleġġ tal-Futbol<br/><br/>L-eks plejer tal-futbol Kevin Jackson juża t-teknoloġija tat-tkessiħ tal-moħħ fit-tamiet tat-tnaqqis tal-effetti ta' korrimenti trawmatiċi fuq il-moħħ u konklużjonijiet relatati mal-isports.<br/>Jackson kien jaħdem lura għall-Università ta' Illinois mill-1994. Minbarra li sofra numru ta' korrimenti lill-ġisem tiegħu matul il-ġurnata tal-logħob tiegħu, Jackson ukoll sofra għadd ta' konsjonijiet mhux dijanjożi. Issa xjentist tar-riċerka u l-porter tad-dannu, Jackson juża l-esperjenza tiegħu bħala plejer biex jgħinu jifhem u jiġġieled it-trawma tal-moħħ fl-isports.<br/>Dan il-vidjow juri l-katina ta' avvenimenti li jseħħu meta sseħħ korriment f'moħħ trawmatiku, jesplora kif is-sintomi tal-konklużjoni ħafna minn persuna għal oħra, jenfasizza l-ħtieġa li wieħed ikun protett mit-trawmi tar-ras ripetuti, u juri kif l-użu ta' teknoloġiji tat-tkessiħ jista' jgħin fl-irkupru mill-ħsara.<br/>Biex titgħallem aktar dwar din ir-riċerka, jekk jogħġbok żur... |
| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Terapija ta' Massaġġ<br/><br/>Massaġġi huwa forsi wieħed mill-eqdem tradizzjonijiet fejqan tal-ġrieħi. Ħafna popli antiki – inklużi l-Griegi tal-qedem, Eġizzjani, Ċiniż u Indjan – kienu konvinti mill-proprjetajiet terapewtiċi ta' massaġġi u użati biex jittrattaw varjetà ta' almenti.<br/><br/>It-terapija tal-massaġġi hija l-prattika tal-kneding jew manipulazzjoni tal-muskoli ta' persuna u tessuti rotob oħrajn sabiex itejbu l-benessri jew is-saħħa tagħhom. Huwa forma ta' terapija manwali li tinkludi żamma, miexja, u l-applikazzjoni tal-pressjoni għall-muskoli, għeruq, ligaments u fascia.<br/><br/>It-terminu 'terapija massaġġi' jintuża biex jiddeskrivi varjetà wiesgħa ta' tekniki li jvarjaw bil-mod li bih jiġu applikati l-mess, il-pressjoni u l-intensità tat-trattament.<br/><br/>Massaġġi għat-trattament ta' xi disturbi<br/><br/>Riċerka tindika li massaġġi u myotherapy huma effettivi fil-ġestjoni ta':<br/><br/>uġigħ tad-dahar subakuta/kronika baxxa<br/><br/>dam is-sorness tal-muskoli ta' fuq (DOMS)<br/><br/>ansjetà<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>feriti ta' tessuti rotob<br/><br/>pressjoni tad-demm għolja<br/><br/>Insomja.<br/><br/>Dawn jistgħu jintużaw b'mod effettiv ukoll biex jappoġġjaw lin-nies b':<br/><br/>marda kronika<br/><br/>marda li thedded il-ħajja bħall-kanċer.<br/><br/>Benefiċċji tal-massaġġi<br/><br/>Wieħed mill-benefiċċji immedjati tal-massaġġi huwa jikkontribrixxu ta' rilassament fil-fond u kalmi. Dan jiġri minħabba li l-massaġġi irażżan ir-rilaxx tal-endorphins – il-kimiċi tal-moħħ (neurotransmitters) li jipproduċu sentimenti ta' benesseri.<br/><br/>Livelli ta' ormoni tal-istress, bħal adrenalina, cortisol u norepinephrine, jitnaqqsu wkoll.

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | L-iżbalji jiġri u jista' jkun triq twila għall-irkupru meta niġu għall-bini mill-ġdid tal-kreditu.<br/><br/>It-Trikketta tal-Cart tax-Xiri hija utli għal persuni li għandhom:<br/><br/>1.

| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring.

Hemm ħafna għodod fuq il-web, li jistgħu jgħinuk biex snap u jallinjaw elementi ma' xulxin, li jħallu l-ebda kamra għal biċċiet li jżommu f'wiċċ l-ilma u disinn messy. Anki l-aktar disinji asimetriċi għandhom xi tipi ta' allinjament u strutturar ta' blokki simili ta' kontenut.<br/><br/>Hija regola ġenerali, li meta jkollok blokki twal ta' testi, allinjament tax-xellug jgħin lill-għajn biex tiskennja kontenut b'mod aktar faċli ta' snien. Dan il-kartellun huwa viżwalizzazzjoni kbira ta' dan il-kunċett.<br/><br/>8. Il-kuntrast ta' l-użu<br/><br/>Jekk tagħti spinta lill-kuntrast ta' element, dan jagħmilha pop. Għall-kuntrarju, l-użu ta' elementi b'kuntrast aktar baxx se jagħmilhom kuntenti u "jgħib".<br/><br/>Hawnhekk, il-kuntrast jenfasizza l-forom arkitettoniċi b'saħħithom, ġeometriċi u grassi u l-logħob tad-dawl u d-dell. Mhux fl-aħħar post, iċ-ċifra żgħira tista' tkun b'kuntrast aktar baxx, meta mqabbla ma' elementi oħra, iżda għadha viżibbli u nicely bilanċi mill-forma kbira, fid-dlam fil-faċċata, fuq il-lemin tax-xellug.<br/><br/>9. użu spazju abjad<br/><br/>L-ispazju abjad huwa għodda li ma tistax tinbidel biex iġġib ċarezza fil-kompożizzjoni tad-disinn tiegħek. L-ispazju abjad mhuwiex "spazju vojta", iżda l-element meħtieġ, li jippermetti d-disinn tiegħek biex jieħu n-nifs.Jgħin ukoll tenfasizza s-suġġett ta' interess.<br/><br/>Per eżempju, f'dan ir-ritratt, l-ispazju abjad kollha (mhux okkupati minn elementi oħra) jgħin biex tiffoka l-attenzjoni kollha fuq il-figura mara u l-qagħda tagħha., Taħseb li int tagħti attenzjoni lil din il-mara, jekk l-immaġni kienet mimlija b'ħafna elementi oħra? Biex jgħinuk tifhem l-importanza ta' l-ispazju abjad, il-ħsieb tal-kamra tiegħek stess. Kif tħossok jekk għandek passaġġ wieħed żgħir biss mill-bieb għas-sodda u kollox huwa mimli bl-oġġetti? Kif tħoss, jekk is-sodda tiegħek ma timlax il-kamra kollha u m'hemm l-ebda oġġett madwar il-post. Iva, ikollok l-ideat – aħna kollha bżonn l-ispazju, anke d-disinn ma.<br/><br/>10. Jifhmu u jużaw it-tip ta' formati<br/><br/>L-ewwel waħda li se nħarsu lejn huwa l-hekk imsejħa, ritratt kbir jew tqassim viżwali uniku li kien popolari ħafna għad-disinjaturi tal-web fis-snin riċenti. Hija tagħti dehra elegant, nadif, normalment tenfasizza prodott jew servizz bl-għajnuna ta' kwalità għolja waħda, ingaġġ tar-ritratti.Dan it-tip ta' tqassim jagħti sens ta' spazju. Kif tista' tissuġġerixxi, mhux użat b'mod komuni għal siti tal-aħbarijiet, fejn hemm ħafna informazzjoni li għandha tiġi ppreżentata. Hawnhekk il-frażi ewlenija hija l-kwalità tal-kwantità.<br/><br/>L-elementi ewlenin għal dan it-tip ta' tqassim huma l-ispazju abjad u t-tip sempliċi.<br/><br/>Tip ieħor ta' tqassim huwa t-tqassim Z.Dan huwa fejn l-għajn tat-telespettatur huwa mmexxi minn element wieħed tad-disinn għal ieħor.<br/><br/>F'dan l-eżempju aħna naturalment ewwel tħares lejn ir-ritratt, mill-għajnejn tagħna huma mfassla għat-test fuq in-naħa tal-lemin tal-vista u mbagħad aħna tkompli scanning isfel, jaqbeż minn viżwali għall-test. Z formati joħolqu ritmu u ħafna drabi jintużaw fuq il-websajt bil-lott ta' informazzjoni, fejn ikollok biex jorjentaw l-utent u "gwida" lilu.<br/><br/>Mod ieħor biex iżommu l-affarijiet sbieħ, pulita u organizzati huwa li tuża l-hekk imsejjaħ proporzjon tad-deheb jew regola ta' terzi. Tista' taqra aktar dwar fl-artikolu tagħna biex tieħu r-ritratti tal-għaġeb, fejn l-istess prinċipju japplika għall-fotografija. Fil-qosor, li taqsam it-tqassim tiegħek f'terzi - kemm vertikalment kif ukoll orizzontalment u tpoġġi l-aktar elementi importanti fejn dawn il-linji jaqsmu, se jagħmlu d-disinn tiegħek aktar viżwalment pjaċir.<br/><br/>L-eżempju hawn huwa l-websajt tal-MailChip., Avviż kif il-karattru tal-xadini huwa kemmxejn fuq ix-xellug?Hija sempliċiment tidher tajba!, Oh, u ħaġa oħra – meta inti tmexxi karattru madwar l-ispazju, mexxiha minn fuq ix-xellug għall-lemin.<br/><br/>11. Oħloq moviment<br/><br/>Il-moviment huwa bidla fil-post jew fil-pożizzjoni, jista' jkun hemm moviment effettiv jew jista' jiġi implikat — l-arranġament ta' partijiet tal-immaġni sabiex it-telespettatur ikollu sens ta' ċaqliq bl-użu ta' linji, forom, nisġa, eċċ.<br/><br/>Peress li l-għajnejn tagħna huma aktar attirati biex jiċċaqalqu oġġetti minn dawk li għadhom, u dan kien importanti għas-sopravivenza ta' wieħed – fil-kaċċa u l-protezzjoni lilek innifsek mill-annimali. Huwa għalhekk li, in-nies huma attirati ħafna għall-immaġini li juru moviment u rispettivament, il-kompożizzjoni bi "fluss" Nizza ta' elementi hija aktar intriganti.<br/><br/>12. Persuni bħal triangolus<br/><br/>Il-forma ta' trijangolu joħloq interess, jistabbilixxi direzzjoni u joħloq moviment. Surely, huwa forma qawwija ħafna u disinjaturi u artisti jużawha biex jorganizzaw it-tqassim tagħhom kif ukoll, u mhux biss bħala element viżwali. Fis-snin riċenti, saret popolari ħafna mad-disinn poligon.<br/><br/>13. Is-simplifikazzjoni<br/><br/>Is-simplifikazzjoni hija t-teknika tat-tnaqqis ta' kompożizzjoni għall-elementi l-aktar essenzjali li jappoġġaw id-dikjarazzjoni viżwali.<br/><br/>Jekk kull parti hija ugwalment importanti, allura kull parti hija ugwalment mhux importanti. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>Huwa naturali għall-għajnejn li tħares lejn id-dettalji, iżda huwa diffiċli ħafna li tara d-disinn kollu u kif l-elementi kollha jaħdmu flimkien.Meta f'dubju, neħħi aħjar l-elementi mill-kompożizzjoni tad-disinn tiegħek, minflok iżżid u tipprova ssib post għalihom. Nafu li huwa clich – iżda għadu leġittimu "L-inqas huwa aktar"!<br/><br/>14. Ara fejn l-elementi tiegħek huma relatati mat-truf<br/><br/>Ħafna drabi, tara d-disinjaturi bl-użu ta' spazju vojt madwar it-truf tat-tqassim, tagħti lill-kamra tad-disinn biex tieħu nifs ġdid.Għal darb'oħra huwa naturali li l-għajn tara l-elementi li jerġgħu joħorġu madwar it-truf u l-qies. Jekk huwa okkupat madwar it-truf fid-disinn tiegħek – l-jikkontribrixxu globali tkun ta' xi ħaġa tqila, kbar u se jieħu l bogħod mill-attenzjoni ta' l-elementi ċentrali.<br/><br/>F'dan il-każ, id-disinjatur uża forma kbira u astratta biex jenfasizza t-tipo – sena u ismijiet. Minħabba li l-forma hija diretta l-għajn, varjata fi ħxuna u għandha sens ta' moviment għaliha, ma jegħlbux it-telespettatur, iżda għall-kuntrarju – toffrilu pjaċir estetika u sempliċità.<br/><br/>15. Kun af it-tranżizzjonijiet<br/><br/>It-tranżizzjoni fil-kompożizzjoni tad-disinn hija ftit aktar diffiċli biex tiddefinixxi. Aħna diskussi ripetizzjoni diġà, meta mqabbla, it-tranżizzjoni tittratta l-fluss naturali minn forma għal oħra, li twassal l-għajn minn post għal ieħor. Spiss, disinjaturi jużaw linji kkurvati u forom biex itaffu t-tranżizzjoni minn forom aktar angolari u blokki ta' kontenut.It-tranżizzjoni tgħin biex jirrilassaw l-għajnejn u "soften" id-disinn.<br/><br/>Qed tfittex xi ispirazzjoni?<br/><br/>Issa li inti Tgħallem xi ħaġa dwar l-ingredjenti ta' l-aktar importanti tal-kompożizzjoni ta' disinn tajba, aħna għamel a gallerija żgħira mal-kompożizzjonijiet tad-disinn aħna ssib ispirazzjoni. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Memorja CD8+ T ċelloli huma ċelloli essenzjali tas-sistema immuni, infezzjoni wara post biex jipproteġu minn insulti immunoloġiċi sussegwenti. Ħafna regolaturi traskrizzjonali u xi kaskata ta' sinjali proxjali assoċjati kemm ma' ċelloli T indiġeni kif ukoll ta' memorja ġew deskritti u ħafna drabi kienu infurmati dwar il-proċess li bih tiġi ffurmata l-memorja immunoloġika. Minkejja d-differenzi ċari fl-espressjoni tal-fattur ta' traskrizzjoni u r-rekwiżiti taċ-ċitokina, kif it-trasformazzjoni globali tas-sinjal indotti mill-anti li torbot bejn iċ-ċelloli tan-naive u tal-memorja CD8+ hija kompletament mhux magħrufa u għalhekk tirrappreżenta diskrepanza sinifikanti fil-bażi ta' għarfien tagħna. Avveniment ewlieni ta' sinjalazzjoni li jseħħ b'rispons għall-istimulazzjoni tat-TCR huwa l-attivazzjoni tal-kinejjiet li jiffiljaw ir-residwi tat-tajers fuq il-proteini tas-sinjali downstream. Għalhekk, il-paragun bejn in-netwerks ta' sinjali ta' fosfru bejn iċ-ċelloli tan-naive u tal-memorja T se jidentifika miri għall-modulazzjoni tas-CD8+ Ir-rispons tal-immunità taċ-ċellula T għar-rispons b'mod pożittiv għall-effikaċja tal-mard u l-vaċċin. L-għan ta' din il-proposta speċifika huwa li jiġu determinati l-mogħdijiet ta' sinjali interċellulari li huma uniċi biex jistimulaw il-memorja CD8+ T ċelloli.L-ipoteżi ċentrali tagħna hija li l-perkorsi ta' tranżazzjonijiet tas-sinjali distinti jirregolaw ir-rispons taċ-ċelloli tal-memorja CD8+. Il-bini tar-raġunament u xjentifiku għax-xogħol propost huwa li nifhmu fil-livell promozzjonali globali l-bidliet li jseħħu fiċ-ċelloli T bħala li jagħmlu differenza minn navigazzjoni għal ċelloli tal-memorja T se jippermettu aktar tilqim u disinn tat-trattament tad-drogi biex jiġġieldu l-mard u l-infezzjoni. Aħna se jittestjaw l-ipoteżi ċentrali tagħna bl-għanijiet speċifiċi li ġejjin: 1) Iddetermina l-bidliet tat-tranżazzjoni sinjal TCR li jseħħu fiċ-ċelloli CD8+ tan-nave u tal-memorja T. Għall-profil tan-netwerks ta' sinjalazzjoni tal-kinase, aħna se jutilizzaw analiżi spettrometrija tal-massa kwantitattiva ħafna li żviluppat fuq iċ-ċelloli tan-naive, tal-isforz u tal-memorja CD8+ T. Ibbażat fuq skrin preliminari, aħna identifikati li Jak2 huwa iperforidat, li jindika li huwa medjatur ewlieni tar-rispons għall-irtirar tal-memorja. Aħna se jittestja l-ipoteżi li l-iperitazzjoni huwa kritiku għal risponsi lura tal-memorja. Flimkien, it-tlestija tal-Aim1 tidentifika netwerks ġodda ta' sinjalazzjoni li jikkontribwixxu għar-risponsi mill-ġdid tal-memorja tas-CD8+ u 2) Id-definizzjoni tal-fosfru tal-proteini vinkolanti tas-CREB (CBP) bħala swiċċ molekulari li jirregola n-netwerks traskrizzjonali fil-memorja CD8+ T ċelloli. Minħabba d-data preliminari tagħna li aħna skopert uniku sinjal mogħdijiet assoċjati mal-formazzjoni taċ-ċelloli CD8+ tal-memorja T, aħna ipotenzjaw li fil-memorja CD8 + T ċelloli, żieda attivazzjoni Jak2 jsuq filosofija tal-CBP għall-promozzjoni ta' pajsaġġ traskurazzjonali uniku kontra ċ-ċellula T navarija. Se nidentifikaw kif il-fiżjoloġija tas-CBP tirregola l-fatturi ta' traskrizzjoni bħal CREB u MYB. Barra minn hekk, aħna se nieħdu approċċ ġenetiku biex niddeterminaw kif is-CBP tiffunzjona fil-formazzjoni ta' ċelloli tal-memorja CD8+ u tweġibiet għall-memorja tas-CD8+. Flimkien, id-dejta miksuba f'dan l-Aim2 se tistabbilixxi mekkaniżmu ġdid li jispjega kif il-bidliet fl-attività tal-kinase tat-tirosina assoċjata ma' CD8+ T il-formazzjoni tal-memorja taċ-ċelloli għandhom programmi ta' traskrizzjoni uniċi.<br/><br/>Ir-Relevanza tas-Saħħa Pubblika<br/><br/>L-istudji proposti hawnhekk se jiddeterminaw, bl-użu ta' spettrometrija tal-massa, l-avvenimenti ta' tranżazzjonijiet tas-sinjal li jseħħu fil-memorja CD8+ T iċ-ċelloli fuq ir-riistimulazzjoni, meta mqabbla maċ-ċelloli CD8+. Minħabba li dawn iċ-ċelloli għandhom rwol essenzjali fil-protezzjoni minn infezzjoni sekondarja, huwa imperattiv li nifhmu l-mekkaniżmi molekulari li permezz tagħhom dawn iċ-ċelloli jeżerċitaw il-funzjoni tagħhom ta' sforz għall-protezzjoni tas-saħħa tal-bniedem. |
