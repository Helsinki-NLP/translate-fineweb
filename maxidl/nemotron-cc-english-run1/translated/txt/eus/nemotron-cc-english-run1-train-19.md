| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Libidoa adinetan zehar<br/><br/>Niri-barruko zenbait objektu doitzen ari nintzen, hala nola bromakkak eta snikak, eta zer ez, eta zer-mota bihurtu zen gauzen bilduma bitxi honetan, Harryk han behera utzi zuen beheko aldean. Ez nago guztiz pozik atera zenarekin, baina ez da txarra nire Harry Potterren bigarren artistaren irudirako, kolore hori edozein modutan egitea erabaki nuen. Bere orbaina non dagoen galdetzen ari bazara, baina oso arina eta txikia da, ordenagailuan pixka bat egin nuelako. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Uda honetan ur gazia arrantzatzen hasi nintzen, eta errebeldia berri bat behar dut. Beraz, Karaken izango da zalantzarik gabe. (Folidan, ez ditugu arrasto ttipi horiek hemen bukatzen).) Mezu pribatua zure alboan.<br/><br/>Oso hunkituta eta nekaturik nago. Honez gain, She- Who-Beyed-rekin topo egiteko modu bat asmatu nahi dut.<br/><br/>Beti aurkitu dut ez dela azalpenik onena. Ez eman bere arrazoiak inoiz ez direla nahikoa. |
| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Onartua eta onartua izan bazara -- bai beste eskola batera joan bazara -- bai Hedapen ikastaroak egin badituzu (hemen ezagutzen ditut? UCLA izenez ezagutzen dut)-><br/><br/>Horixe da nire interpretazioa, agertoki horietako edozein "graduko programa" edo "ikastaro osagarriak" direlako UC Berkeleyn. Erabat oker egon naiteke, baina hobe duzu horiek deitzea eta zure egoera zehatza argitzea.<br/><br/>Nire iritzia: Berban oinarrituta, galdera hau egin nuen, Berkeley-n onartzen bazinetete bezala, artatu nahi duzun ala ez. Onartu eta parte hartu ahal izateko, erraz ikusi ahal izango dute aplikazioko "Graduko Erakundeak" atalaren bidez. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | .........

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Neguko babesa Fig zuhaitzen<br/><br/>Artikulu hau irakurri<br/><br/>Neguko babesa Fig zuhaitzen<br/><br/>Orokorra<br/><br/>Gutxienez 5.000 urtetik gorako pikondoa izan da, eta mundu osoan hazten da bere fruitu gozoagatik.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Oculus CEO-k gogor egiten du Mac-en Rfit-en laguntza<br/><br/>Oculus CEOk, Palmer Luckeyk, ez ditu bere hitzak nahastu elkarrizketa batean, Rift VR entzungailuek Mac-a inoiz lagunduko ote duen galdetuz. laster espero baduzu, agian etsipena izateko prest egon nahi izango zenuke.<br/><br/>Hori gertatzen da Apple-rekin. Ordenagailu on bat argitaratzen badute, egingo dugu.<br/><br/>Hain zuzen ere, zentzu ez hain diplomatikoari buruz hitz egiten duena Rifren agindu beharreko grafiko diskretuak dira. Egia sinplea da Applek ez duela punta-puntako grafikoetarako bakarrik joaten entzungailuen eskakizunak betetzen dituzten goi-mailako grafikoetarako. Windows PC batean, gutxieneko GTX 970 bat behar duzu, $ 300 txartel grafiko bat.<br/><br/>Luckeyk esan zuen bezala:<br/><br/>Apple-k goi-mailako GPUak lehenesten ez dituela uste du, $ 6,6 Mac Pro erosi ahal izango duzu AMP Fire Pro D700 lineako goialdean, eta oraindik ez du gure gomendatutako zehaztapenak betetzen. Beraz, egunean zehar atzera egiten zuten bitartean erabiltzen zituzten goi-mailako GPUak lehenetsiz gero, Mac-i laguntzeko gustatuko litzaiguke. Baina oraintxe bertan, ez dago makina bakar bat bakarrik babesten duena.<br/><br/>Mac Pro-k ezin du zaldi-boterea asko ez paketatzea leporatu, zeren egiten duen, baina FirePro grafikoak ere sormen-merkatura zuzentzen dira, Mac Pro bezala. Mac Pro-ek, batez ere, beste hardware-eskakizunak gainditzen ditu, baina naturalki Rfit-a grafiko handia denez, hau da, jaitsiera laburra. Zortea, agian, apur bat gorago egotea da, baina bera Riftaren atzean dago, beraz, ez dago zalantzarik egia esan duenarekin, nahiz eta ez duen ondo esan.<br/><br/>Zer diozu zuk, munduko Mac jabeek?

Opengl 20% motelagoa da eta, batzuetan, baino askoz gehiago, zuzenean x-rekin alderatuta, OSX exekutatzen ari den lineako kartaren goiko maila azkar bat da leihoetan. Beraz, arazo handiak ez diren makarro gehienak ere berritu dira.<br/><br/>Mac prozesua hain desberdina da, Applek hau egin beharko lukeen bezala, ez luke merezi txartel saltzaile batek egitea, horretarako erosle kopuru txiki batekin egongo balitz bezala. Applek ez du dirua galtzen, beraz, ez dut hau ikusten. Applek dirua galduko du bideo-txartel berria berritzeko Mac-erako.<br/><br/>Beno puntu bat du, nahiz eta kuluxkari buruz arduratzen naizen, VR-i itxaron beharrean, aukera bat izan beharko luke GPUak hobeak gehitzeko iMac eta MacBook Pro batean.

VR software bat garatu nahi badut, Applek ez nau aukerarik utzi, PC bat erosi edo eraikitzeko. Apple zale handi bat (bai, onartu dut) honek triste egiten nau.<br/><br/>BTW, VR ez da beldur bat. Zer esan nahi dudan probatu baduzu, VR-k betirako aldatuko du jokoa eta edukia betirako aldatuko du. Nire kezka bakarra VR-a oso ona da. Milioika pertsona egon daitezke, mundu birtualetan bizitzen eta jolasten. Begira zenbat jenderi adikzioa ematen dioten eta pantaila lau batean jokatzen diren. VR benetan gustatzen zaizuen jokoan.<br/><br/>Ezer ez kezkatu, ni nahiko segurua den Apple-k Mac eta iOS-erako bere ezarpena izango du, kontsumitzaileentzat prest dagoenean, oraintxe bertan erabiltzaile gogorragoentzat da.

Maite dut nire Mac-a, baina Lord grafikoak bultzada bat behar du. Ez da beharrezkoa kostua handiagoa izatea, baina txartel grafiko hobe baterako gehigarri bat ordaintzea baino gehiago nuke, edo, gutxienez, nirea instalatzeko aukera izatea. Benetan txarra izan behar zuen bere adierazpen-soinua erraz ikusia izatea. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Zer esan zuen Guysek 19<br/><br/>Ez, entretenimendu-ekoizleek eta produktu-ekoizleek ikusleen gehiengoaren itxura duten aktore / aktore eta modeloa nahi dutelako da, beraz, fidagarriak dira eta, beraz, salmenta-erreminta eraginkorragoak dira.

Batzuetan deseroso bihurtu naiz, nahiz eta norbanakoek ez dute ezer egin horri aurre egiteko.
