| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Esate baterako, Amerikako Konstituzioaren II. artikuluak dioenez, « Tratatu guztiak» eduki behar dira», nahiz eta argi eta garbi azaltzen den itunek ez dutela inolako eraginik lege federalek. Egia esan, xedapen horiek Senatuko eta Presidentearen oniritziarekin lege federal bezala indarrean sartu ondoren bakarrik izango dira operatibo horiek. Praktika hori izan arren, nazioarteko zuzenbideko printzipio onartu bat da, zenbait itunek eragina izan dezaten herrialdeetan. Itunak estatuari zuzenean indarrean jarri behar dio bere burua auto-exekutibo izateko, legerik gabe.<br/><br/>Horrek galdera sortzen du zein itunaren «autoexek» gisa kalifikatuko duen eta zein ez?<br/><br/>Itun bat autoexekutiboa den ala ez erabakitzeko itun bat da, edo ez da epaile nazionalek erabaki behar kasu batzuetan (Buergenal, 1992). Hori ulertzeko, lehenik eta behin, bi teoria motak aztertuko dira, eta ondoren, Estatu Batuetako legeari aplikatzen zaizkion itunen izaeraren arabera aztertuko dira. Bi teoria horiek monoomisismoa eta dualismoa dira. Etxeko eta nazioarteko zuzenbidearen esparrua hierarkia bakarrean eta bi hierarkia bereizi gisa hartzen dute funtsean, hurrenez hurren (Wildhaber, 1971). Txanponaren ondorengo herrialdeek uste dute itun batzuk berehala lotesleak direla eta herrialdean eragin handia duela. Ituna berretsi ondoren, nazio-auzitegietan inbokatu daiteke eta herrialdeko lege baten zatitzat jotzen da. dualismoaren ondorengo herrialdeek uste dute itun batek ez diola eraginik etxeko zuzenbideri, parlamentuan onartutako lege batek indartu arte. • Do dualismoaren adibide bat da, Giza Eskubideen Europako Hitzarmena Erresuma Batuan egin zen 1998ko Giza Eskubideen Legea parlamentuan (Legeak, 2000).<br/><br/>Nazioarteko zuzenbidea askotarikoa da, eta, beraz, hainbat izapide motak jarraitzen dute itunak onartzeko. Herrialde batzuek nazioarteko itun zuzenbideari eta ohiko nazioarteko zuzenbideari emandako hainbat tratamendu ere badituzte. Europar Batasunak bere estatu kideen legeetan eragina izan ohi dute maiz. Europar Batasuneko estatu kideek eragin handia izan behar dute erkidego-legediko zenbait forma, nahiz eta funtsezko desberdintasuna izan autoexekutazioko tratatuetatik. Desberdintasuna ez da epaile nazionalentzat xedapen autoexekatzaileak diren ala ez erabakitzeko, baizik eta Europako Justizia Auzitegiak bere itun konstituzionaletan interpretatzeko. Nazioarteko beste lege-mota batzuek ebazpenen bidez edo egoera horietarako ez lukete ondorio bera izan behar; hala ere, baliteke "lege biguna" gisa kontuan hartu eta legearen asmoa interpretatzeko modua izatea. Batzuetan, nazioarteko erakunde judizialek, hala nola Giza Eskubideen Gorte Interamerikarrak, beren estatu kideei eragiten dieten aldarrikapenak. Adierazpen horiek estatu kideetan lotesleak ez diren arren, epaile nazionalak interpretazio autoritariorako horiei erreferentzia egiten die.<br/><br/>Hori dela eta, kasu-kasu bat egin behar da hainbat herrialdetan ezarritako prozedura eta aurrekariak aztertzen diren bitartean. Auto-exekuzioaren kontzeptua aztertzeko, artikulu honek hainbat eskumenek ezarritako aurrekariak alderatuko ditu. Irakurleak antzeko analisi bat egin nahi badu, nazioarteko zuzenbideari buruzko urte askotako liburu nazionaletara jo dezake, eta, batez ere, liburu horiek nazioarteko zuzenbidearen eta nazioaren arteko harremanari buruzko atal bat izango dute.<br/><br/>Nazioarteko jurisdikzioa:<br/><br/>Auzitegi nazionaletarako auzirik garrantzitsuena ituna autoexekatuta dagoen ala ez da? Itunak legerik gabe aplikatu ahal izango du hori indartzeko beste inongo legerik gabe. Auzi hau sortu zen Estatu Ogasun eta Estatu Ogasun ministroaren kasuan, non Konstituzio Auzitegiak esan zuenez, itun horrek ez zuela inolaz ere bere autoexekuuak izan ( Bug váreclaims, Czesław S v Estatuko Ogasuna eta Estatuko Ogasun ministroa, 2003). Funtsean, itun horrek barne hartzen dituen barne-neurriei erreferentzia egiten die, ez ditu berez betebehar berriak sortzen, eta, horren ordez, itun horrek indartu egiten du bere prozesu juridikoari dagozkion neurriak hartzeko. Kasu honetan, Estatu Batuetako Estatu Batuetan antzeko arazo bat sortu zen, Eskubide Zibil eta Politikoen Nazioarteko Ituna alderdi autoexekutiboa izan zen. Auzitegi Gorenak adierazi du, halaber, Eskubide Zibil eta Politikoen Nazioarteko Ituna ez dela auto-exekutiboa (Estatu Batuetako Auzitegia, 2004). Suitzako Auzitegi Gorenak, bestalde, eskubide zibil eta politikoei buruzko Nazioarteko Hitzarmenaren autoexekzioa aztertu zuen, eta auzia, auzitegiaren aurrean zegoen 13. artikulua (2) eta c.) naturan autoexekutuak izan ziren. Epaitegiak erabaki zuen ituna partzialki autoexekatuta zegoela, eta hala egin zuen, indarrean zegoen ala ez egiaztatuz, aplikatu beharreko itunaren oinarrizko edukiren bat. Epaitegiak agindu zuen ez zuela aurreikuspen hori aurkitu Zuricheko kontentzien garaian (A eta Bv Gobernua, 2000).<br/><br/>Ezinbestekoa da gai horiek nazioarteko zuzenbidearen funtsezko galderatik desberdinak direla ulertzea, lurraren legearen zati gisa aplikatu daitekeen ala ez? Galdera hau erantzuteko, artikulua Dominikar Errepublikako Auzitegi Gorenak aztertuko du. Auzitegi Gorenak adierazi zuen Dominikar Errepublikaren 3. artikuluak nazioarteko zuzenbidean loteslea zela etxeko ordenamendu juridikoan. Auzitegi Gorenak uko egin zion Gorte Nagusiei itun horiek "kanpoko legekoak" zirela, eta ez etxeko lege-ordenaren zati bat. Auzitegi Gorenak ebatzi zuen Dominikar Errepublikak berretsitako itun guztiak Dominikar Zuzenbidearen parte zirela, eta, beraz, autoexekuzioa dela (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción eta Ors, 1997). Suitzako Auzitegi Gorenak aztertu du Lisboako Hitzarmena Suitzako Unibertsitateei zuzenean aplika dakiekeen ala ez. Epaitegiak "kasu garrantzitsu baten arabera, lege-arau bat zuzenean aplikatuko da bere edukia behar bezala zehaztuta badago eta kasu jakin batean erabaki bat osatzeko. Beraz, araua justizia izan behar da, hau da, gizabanako baten eskubideak eta betebeharrak definitzen ditu eta agintari eskudunei zuzendu behar zaie" (X v v Lucerne, 2014). Horrek esan nahi du ituna zuzenean aplikagarria den edo ez, araua bidezkoa den ala ez, oinarritzen dela. Lisboako Ituna jasotako tituluen printzipioan oinarritzen da. Ituneko IV. (1) artikuluaren bidez transmititzen da. Horren helburua Estatuek erabakiak hartzeko prozesua zuzena, gardena eta diskriminaziorik gabekoa dela erakustea zen. Eskatzaileak beharrezko irizpideak bete ez dituela egiaztatzen duen erantzukizuna " Ebaluazioa egiten duen erakundea" da. Itunak estatuek oro har onartzen dituzten babes prozesalak bermatzen ditu, eta, beraz, epaitegiek hainbat herrialdetako interpretazioak erakusten dituzte.<br/><br/>Ezinbestekoa da jakitea itunek benetan ezarritako arauak betetzen ari diren ala ez. Hainbat jurisdikziotako legeek agerian utzi dute nazioetako auzitegi nazionalak direla autoexekzioa egiten ari den ala ez. Hitzarmen Vienako hitzarmenen 26. artikuluaren arabera, itunen interpretazio eta exekuziorako herrialdeei bakarrik egozten zaie. 27. artikulua. Nazioarteko lege-betebeharrik ez dagoela justifikatzeko indarrean sartuko da. Auzitegi askok interpretazio-iturri gisa erabili dute hori, hala nola Letoniako Konstituzio Auzitegia. Nazioarteko arau batekin gatazka nazional bat gertatuz gero, auzitegiak arau nazionala deuseztu eta baliogabetzat jo zuen. Haren ondoriorako, epaitegiak fede onaren beharrezko jardunaren mende jarri zuen, VLCTren 26. artikuluan aurreikusitakoaren arabera (Linija v Letonia, 2004).<br/><br/>Ondorioa:<br/><br/>Aurrekoari dagokionez, argi dago itunek baldintza bereziak dituztela autoexektu ahal izateko. Hala ere, alde horretatik, garrantzitsuena oraindik ere auzitegi nazionalen interpretazioa da. Auzitegi nazionalek erabakitzen dute itunak autoexekatzera edo ez. Nahiz eta Konstituzioaren arabera lurralde-lege gorena izatearen xedapen bat egon, herrialde ezberdinetako auzitegiek hainbat modutan interpretatzen dituzte xedapen horiek. Hau ikus daiteke nola dauden Amerikako eta Dominikar Konstituzioak xedapen hauek baina haien interpretazio erabat desberdinak jarraitzen dituzte. Ezin da "auto-exekuzioa" terminoa adostu itun horiek, praktikan, oraindik ere auzitegi nazionalen onarpena behar dute. Modu idealean, aurrera egiteko moduak herrialdeak itunen autoexekzioa aitortzen du eta VLCren 26. eta 27. artikuluak errespetatzen duen moda batean tratatzen du.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years.

Horrek esan nahi zuen Deadlisten Harrapatuk izugarrizko jaitsiera izan zuela hainbat urtez.Hey, gutxienez Discovery-k fakturak ordaintzeko, ezta? |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGak<br/><br/>Begiratu gure blogen bilduma ikaskideek idatzitakoa.<br/><br/>Informazio-aldizkariak<br/><br/>Ez estresatu ezazu<br/><br/>egilea: by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; 2020ko azaroaren 12a<br/><br/>Estresak, ez du axola zein handiak diren gauzak, beti aurki dezake bere buru itsusia berreskuratzeko modu bat. Azken lan eskaera bat edo idatzi behar duzun hurrengo egunean, estresa beti zure egunean aurkitzen da, uzten baduzu. Gaur erakutsiko dizut estresa kentzeko edo saihesteko gauza batzuk egin ahal izango dituzu.<br/><br/>Ariketa egitean estresa arintzeko modu bikaina da, zure gorputzean kortesia izenez ezagutzen den estresaren hormona murrizten baitu.Zure gorputzeko kortisol maila baxuagoak izango dira zure estresaren maila txikiagoan. Ariketak zure konfiantza ere areagotu dezake, eta orduan zure konfiantza handitu egiten da, normalean, zure estresa jaitsi egiten da. Niretzat, estututa dudanean, beti gimnasiora eta kolaboraziora joanda, kaloria erretzen laguntzen dut, eta estresa murrizten laguntzen dit, ondo pasatzean.<br/><br/>Gauzak idaztea oso denbora luzea izan da jendea lasaitzeko modu bat izan da, eta gure zerrendan hurrengo gaia da. Idazten ari zarena adimena garbitzeko modu bat da, estresa kentzeko ere laguntzen du. Antzeko esperientzia daukat istorioak idaztean, normalean ezin badut ideia berri bat pentsatzen, ideia zaharra idatziko dut eta horretaz hausnartuko dut. Hori da ideia berriak sortzen hasten direnean eta normalean idazten jarrai dezaket. Berdina da estresarekin. Ur-jauzi bati buruz pentsatzen jarraitzen du, zizelatzen gaituen bitartean, ur-fluxua blokeatzen du eta dena eraikitzen hasten da. Ur-fluxua normaltasunera eramateko modu bakarra ur-fluxua kentzea da. Hau da idazpena. Idazten duzunean, pieza estresa kentzen ari zara berriro pentsa arte.<br/><br/>Estresa gure bizitzan sartzen da irekitzen ditugun ateen bidez. Prokratspena, ateak estreserako irekita uzteko modu bat da. Bihar arte itxarotea dibertigarria izan daiteke gaur egun, baina bihar minik egingo dizu, eta oso irtenbide labur bat da. Zenbat eta denbora gehiago itxaron, orduan eta handiagoa izango da zerbait, eta zenbat eta estresa handiagoa izango da zure bizitzara gonbidatuko zaituzten. Jasotzen dugun unean zerbait zaintzea estresa prebenitzeko modu bikaina da, baina hori baino zerbait gehiago diziplinatsua da. Gero eta gehiago ebakitzen duzu zure bizitzatik, estresa gehiago izango zara. Beraz, ate hori itxi, aire hotz guztia botatzen ari zara.<br/><br/>Beraz, aztertu: ariketa, idatzi zer estresa arintzeko modu batzuk baino ez dira, baina eraginkorrenak dira. Badakit hauek ez direla lan egin nahi inork ikertu nahi duen bezala, nola kendu. |
