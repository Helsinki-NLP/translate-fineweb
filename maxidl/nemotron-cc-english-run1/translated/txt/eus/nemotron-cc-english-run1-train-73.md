So an abundant and essential source of energy that would be used in space for the space colony would be solar radiation by developing satellite solar power stations. To live in space, humans must be protected from the fierce intensity and penetrating wavelengths of unattenuated sunlight, but this same energy is one of the primary resources of space. The colony will have to have enough energy to maintain a fairly uniform temperature even though it is apace. The sun shines twenty-four hours a day and is not dimmed by an atmosphere. Shaded materials not exposed to direct sunlight will almost be at absolute zero. While the temperature in closed bodies exposed to the sun can soar above the boiling point. The colony will need to have both heaters and air conditioners. On the other hand, this sun's energy can be converted into electricity in the colonies. It will be converted with ten percent efficiency to electrical power which is sold at a rate of .012 kw/hr, a square kilometre of space would return more than $14,000,000 each year. Converting solar power to electricity in space, we would build satellite solar power stations that would intercept the sunlight and convert it into electricity. The satellite solar power stations would intercept enough sunlight to replace five nuclear reactors or coal plants. The stations could be as big as nine miles long and four miles wide and it would only weigh twenty thousand tons. It would be built with hollow triangular girders made of aluminum that is very fast and easy to build . Solar power satellites are a pollution free way to generate electricity and cost no more than coal or nuclear energy. There has been twomajor designed stations made so far.

| With the role of the media being crucial<br/><br/>With the role of the media being crucial in the promotion of development the Tonga also sought to curtail the media blackout by establishing a community radio station. In 2007 they established the Tonga on air. It was meant to cater for the Tonga who had not been receiving coverage from the state media. The establishment of the radio station was a move aimed at providing the Tonga with access to information and giving Tonga arts and culture exposure. Mudimba points out to the significance of the radio station basing on the fact that the Tonga did not have any radio or television signal for years and that the establishment of Tonga on air would give the BaTonga community the chance to be informed as well as the chance to reach out to the general populace.<br/>The establishment of the radio at Sinazongwe was aided by a team of Austrian radio activists was primarily aimed at improving communication and access to information in the marginalised remote area. The station was at Sinanzongwe Basic School and had the capacity to cover a radius of 20 kilometres reaching out to approximately 10000 people and was meant to serve the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi<br/>For a marginalised community like the Tonga a community radio station can be used as a means for articulation and self-representation which not only helps in strengthening self-consciousness , identity , and culture but it is also an apparatus of communication which contributes to the emancipation and autonomy of a people in a region dominated by political crisis and gives impulse to a vivid public discourse on culture , society and politics. In that way a community radio station will is broad promoter of public discourse.. it facilitates for equal medial participation as it is open to more democratic and self-organised as it is open to the community. The Tonga on air project has also facilitated for the re-joining of families which were once separated by the construction of the Kariba dam. A community radio station also influences change in media policy as it forwards. The radio station also helped in bridging the information gap. It also offers educational programmes in Tonga thus it is very audible to the targeted community<br/>Establishment of a Community Museum<br/>Also as a way of promoting and developing Tonga language and culture the BaTonga also established a community museum at Binga centre. The museum has played a significant role in revitalising Tonga language and culture. BaTonga Museum (2012) the museum known as BaTonga Museum was established in 2000 with the help as a concerted effort between the Tonga community and MS Zimbabwe a Danish non-governmental organisatiion.as highlighted above in community ladened with stereotypes and misconceptions which have led to the near extinction of Tonga language and culture the museum serves as a platform to rewrite the history of the Tonga through the various programmes it carries out. BaTonga Museum (2002) the main objective of the museum is to demystify Tonga culture and create awareness about the Tonga locally, nationally and internationally.it also seeks to rebuild self-esteem and dignity amongst the Tonga. Furthermore besides promoting and preserving Tonga language and cultural material the museum also works in support of the livelihoods of Tonga artists by buying artefacts for display in the gallery. Since ones culture is also conveyed through arts the museum has played a very significant role in this respect. The museum also hosts a number of cultural events which are e With the above objectives in mind the establishment of BaTonga Museum by the Tonga community can be deemed a good developmental initiative as it helps to promote the recognition of the Tonga people. According to Chikozho the curator of the museum the museum has made a major contribution towards the restoration of the Tonga social fabric. He attributes his assertion to the role the museum has played in Binga district and in Zimbabwe at large. The museum has acted as a source of information to both the Tonga and the general populace. By taking responsibility of buying Tonga cultural material the museum has both supported Tonga livelihoods and the promotion and preservation of Tonga culture. Previously Tonga artefacts were being sold on the informal market and exported out of the country at low costs and were sold at very huge prices and in some instances they would be given alien names which meant that the Tonga were being exploited. Such a scenario did not do the Tonga good thus the museum's role in protecting Tonga cultural material is a way of promoting development amongst the Tonga through promoting their culture. The museum is also a resource centre as everyone whom wishes to learn about Tonga culture is referred to it in as far as Tonga history and culture is concerned.<br/><br/>The Introduction ICT amongst The Tonga<br/>The Tonga through the help of donors has also made efforts to promote access to modern technology by introducing ICT to the Tonga community. They launched the Tonga Online project in 2001. The establishment of the project was facilitated by the Kunzwana Trust which worked with the Austrian Zimbabwean friendship association. Since its launch the Tonga online project has primarily focused on promoting a Tonga voice over the internet. The projects objectives are to provide the Tonga access to the worlds most advanced communication tools which will enable them to represent themselves to the outside world and reflect upon the social, political and economic environment of both the global village in which the Tonga live.<br/>The project derives its name mulonga from the Zambezi River. The name reflects the history and aspirations of the Tonga people. The name constantly revokes memories of how the Tonga were displaced to make way for the construction of the Kariba dam which has seen them becoming a marginalised group in Zimbabwe. Even well after their relocation the Tonga are being passed by huge commercial benefits from tourism and electricity that are being extracted from their former habitat which was transformed into a vast expanse of water known as the Kariba dam . The Tonga Online project seeks to establish and expand communication technology with and amongst the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi by joining them in with information communication technology. A number of school based information technology centres have been established in Binga district have been established in Binga district namely at Binga High School and at Manjolo and these have catered for the larger Tonga community with more schools being earmarked for the project<br/>Access to information has become a great question of political rights hence the importance of the Tonga Online project as a tool to spearhead awareness continuity empowerment and local development amongst the Tonga people. The educational significance of the Tonga online project is very significant especially for those in a remote part of the country like Binga where there are no institutions of higher learning<br/>The project also reflects the digital divide and other uneven developments; in the global village. These gaps and imbalances are not only a question of access to resources but also to have the capacity to use these modern day communication tools. In a world where access to information has become a universal human right the Tonga online project tends to support higher levels of human development<br/>The use of the global village has created a platform of for the Tonga to promote their culture through the internet. Currently the internet is one of the most convenient modes of communication and the Tonga Online project is a platform that can be used to give the Tonga a voice on the internet. It has been used as a platform by the Tonga to interact with other cultures hence it has been a medium of cultural exchange thus promoting the recognition of the Tonga<br/><br/>We Will Write a Custom Essay Specifically For You For Only $13.90/page! | Komunikabideak funtsezko eginkizuna du<br/><br/>2007an Tongako garapena sustatzeko komunikabideek funtsezko eginkizuna izan zuten komunikabideei buruz, irrati komunitario bat eratuz. Estatu komunikabideetatik estaldurarik ez zuen Tongakorako jatetxea izan zen. Irrati-estazioa sortzea izan zen, Tongako informazioa eta kultura-adierazpenerako sarbidea emateko. Mumbai-k irrati-estazioaren garrantzia aipatzen du, Tongakoak ez zuela irrati- edo telebista-seinalerik urte luzez, eta Tongako aireportuari, oro har, informazioa eskuratzeko aukera emango ziolarik.<br/>Sinazonweko irrati-sisten talde batek sortu zuen, batez ere urruneko eremuko komunikazio eta informaziorako sarbidea hobetzeko. Geltokia Sananzongweko Basic eskolan zegoen eta 20 kilometro inguruko erradioa estaltzeko gaitasuna izan zuen, gutxi gorabehera 10000 pertsona inguru hurbilduta, eta Tonga zerbitzatzeko gauza zen bi aldeetan.<br/>Komunitateko irrati-estazio bat adibidez, trantsizio- eta auto-irudikapen-bide gisa erabil daiteke, ez bakarrik autokontzientzia, identitatea eta kultura indartzeko, baizik eta komunikazio-aparatua da, krisi politiko batean nagusi den herri baten autonomia eta emantzipazioa eta autonomia bultzatzen dituena, eta kultura, gizartea eta politika ardatz dituena. Horrela irrati-kate bat zabalduko da diskurtso publikoaren sustatzaile zabal batekin, eta aukera ematen du komunikabide berdintasunez parte hartzeko, komunitatera irekita baitago. Tonga on air proiektuan, Karibako urtegiaren eraikuntzak banatzen zituen familiak berrelkartzea ere erraztu du. Komunitate-erradioak ere eragina du komunikabideetan, aurrera egin ahala. Irrati-estazioak informazio-hutsunea ekartzen ere lagundu zuen, eta Tongako hezkuntza-programak ere eskaintzen ditu, xede-komunitateari oso zabalduta.<br/>Artium Museoaren sorrera<br/>Era berean, Tongako hizkuntza eta kultura sustatzeko eta garatzeko modu gisa, Binga zentroan komunitate-museo bat ere ezarri du. BA Tongako Museoa (Banga Museoa) 2000. urtean sortu zen, Tongako komunitatearen eta MS Zimbabweko gobernuz kanpoko erakunde baten arteko ahalegin bateratu gisa. Horren arabera, komunitate horrek konpromisoa hartu zuen, eta, horren ondorioz, Tongako hizkuntza eta kultura ia desagertu ziren estereotipo eta nahasketekin. Ondarearen Museoa 2002. urtean, museoaren helburu nagusia Tonga kultura deszifratzea eta Tongakoari buruzko ezagutza sortzea da, bertako, nazioko eta nazioarteko mailan. Horrez gain, Tongako hizkuntza eta kultura-materiala sustatu eta zaintzeaz gain, bertan ikusgai dauden artefaktuak erosiz ere egiten da lan museoan. Kulturatik, arteen bidez ere transmititzen da, eta oso paper garrantzitsua izan du alor horretan. Horrez gain, Museoak zenbait kultura-gertakari hartzen ditu kontuan, eta horiek kontuan hartu behar dira Puntako komunitatearentzat Punta-komunikabidearen ezarpenari begira; izan ere, ekimen hori garapen egokitzat har daiteke, izan ere, pertsonen arteko aitorpena sustatzen laguntzen du. Erakusketaren komisarioaren arabera, museoko komisarioak ekarpen handia egin dio Tongako gizarte-ehuna birgaitzeko, eta bertan erakusten du museoko zeregina Binga auzoan eta Zimbabwen egon dela. Museoak Tonga eta bertako jendearentzako informazio iturri gisa jardun du, eta Tongako kultura-materiala erosteaz gain, Tongako bizimodua sustatu eta kultura zaindu du. Aurretik, Tongako artefak merkatu informalean saltzen ziren, eta herrialdetik esportatuta zeuden kostu txikietan, eta oso prezio handietan saltzen ziren, eta kasu batzuetan Tonako izenak ematen zitzaizkien, eta horrek ustiatu egin ziren. Horrelako agertoki batek ez zuen Tonga ona egin, beraz, museoa Tongako kultur materiala babestearen zeregina da, Tongako kulturaren sustapenaren bidez. Horrez gain, baliabide-zentro bat da, Tongako kulturaz eta kulturaz arduratu nahi duena.<br/><br/>Sarrera IKTa Tonakoaren artean<br/>Dohaintza-emaileen laguntzaren bidez teknologia modernorako sarbidea sustatzeko ahaleginak ere egin ditu Tongako komunitatera sartuz, 2001ean Tonga Online proiektua abiarazi zuten. Proiektua martxan jarri zenean, Kunzwana Trust-ek eman zuen, eta horrek Austriaren arteko adiskidetasunarekin lan egin zuen. Izan ere, Tonga lineako proiektua internet bidez ahots bat sustatzea izan du helburu. Proiektuen helburua da munduko komunikazio-tresna aurreratuenetara Tongako sarbidea ematea, mundua kanpoko ordezkari eta herri globaleko ingurune sozial, politiko eta ekonomikoari buruz gogoeta egiteko.<br/>Izenak herriaren historia eta asmoak islatzen ditu. Izenak etengabe gogorarazten ditu nola hedatzen ziren Karibako urtegia eraikitzeko, Zimbabweko talde marjinala bihurtuz. Tonga kendu ondoren ere, merkataritza-onura handiak eta elektrizitate-onura handiak igarotzen ari dira, garai hartako habitatetik ateratzen direnak, Karibako presa izenez ezagutzen den uraren hedapen handi bat bihurtuz. Tonga Online proiektuak komunikazioaren teknologia ezarri eta zabaltzea du helburu, eta Zambeziako bi aldeen artean, komunikazio-teknologiarekin bat egitea du helburu. Binga auzoan kokatutako ikastetxe teknologiko batzuk Binga auzoan ezarri dira, hau da, Binga High Schoolen eta Manjolon, hain zuzen, Tonga komunitate handiagoarentzat aukeratu dira, ikastetxe gehiago proiektuarentzat hartuta.<br/>Informaziora sarbidea eskubide politikoen auzi bihurtu da, eta, beraz, Tonga Online proiektuak izan du garrantzia, pertsonen artean etengabeko hobekuntza eta tokiko garapena sustatzeko tresna gisa. Tonga lineako proiektuaren hezkuntza garrantzia oso garrantzitsua da herrialde hartako urruneko zati batean, Binga bezalako erakundeak ez daude goi-mailako ikaskuntzaren erakunderik.<br/>Proiektuak, era berean, banaketa digitala eta bestelako garapen irregularrak islatzen ditu; mundu-mailan, hutsuneak eta hutsuneak ez dira baliabideetarako soilik, baizik eta eguneroko komunikazio-tresna modernoak erabiltzeko gaitasuna ere badute. Informaziora sarbidea giza eskubide unibertsal bihurtu den mundu batean, Tonga online proiektuak giza garapen maila altuagoa izan nahi du<br/>Mundu-mailako herrixkaren erabilerak Tongako plataforma bat sortu du internet bidez kultura sustatzeko. Gaur egun internet komunikazio modu erosoena da eta Tonga Online proiektua Interneteko ahots bat emateko erabil daitekeen plataforma da.

| Computer Networks – ARP<br/><br/>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure for mapping a dynamic Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a Media Access Control or MAC address.<br/><br/>The job of the ARP is essentially to translate 32-bit addresses to 48-bit addresses and vice-versa. This is necessary because in IP Version 4 (IPv4), the most common level of Internet Protocol (IP) in use today, an IP address is 32-bits long, but MAC addresses are 48-bits long.<br/><br/>ARP works between network layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). The MAC address exists on layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer, while the IP address exists on layer 3, the network layer.<br/><br/>ARP can also be used for IP over other LAN technologies, such as token ring, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and IP over ATM.<br/><br/>In IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses, ARP has been replaced by the Neighbor Discovery protocol.<br/><br/>How ARP works<br/><br/>When a new computer joins a LAN, it is assigned a unique IP address to use for identification and communication. When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular LAN arrives at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a MAC address that matches the IP address. A table called the ARP cache maintains a record of each IP address and its corresponding MAC address.<br/><br/>All operating systems in an IPv4 Ethernet network keep an ARP cache. Every time a host requests a MAC address in order to send a packet to another host in the LAN, it checks its ARP cache to see if the IP to MAC address translation already exists. If it does, then a new ARP request is unnecessary. If the translation does not already exist, then the request for network addresses is sent and ARP is performed.<br/><br/>ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines know they are using that particular IP address. When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.<br/><br/>Host machines that don't know their own IP address can use the Reverse ARP (RARP) protocol for discovery.<br/><br/>An ARP cache size is limited and is periodically cleansed of all entries to free up space; in fact, addresses tend to stay in the cache for only a few minutes. Frequent updates allow other devices in the network to see when a physical host changes their requested IP address. In the cleaning process, unused entries are deleted as well as any unsuccessful attempts to communicate with computers that are not currently powered on.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing and ARP cache poisoning<br/><br/>Any LAN that uses ARP must be wary of ARP spoofing, also referred to as ARP poison routing or ARP cache poisoning. ARP spoofing is a device attack in which a hacker broadcasts false ARP messages over a LAN in order to link an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server within the network. Once a link has been established, the target computer can send frames meant for the original destination to the hacker's computer first as well as any data meant for the legitimate IP address.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing can have serious impacts on enterprises. When used in their simplest form, ARP spoofing attacks can steal sensitive information. However, the attacks can also go beyond this and facilitate other malicious attacks, including: | Ordenagailu sareak – ARP<br/><br/>Helbidea Ebazpenaren Protokoloa (ARP) Interneteko protokolo dinamiko bat (IP helbidea) tokiko sare fisiko batean (LAN) ezartzeko prozedura da. Makinaren helbide fisikoa ere Media Access Control edo MAC helbidea bezala ezagutzen da.<br/><br/>ARPAren lana funtsean 32 biteko helbideak 48 biteko helbideetara eta alderantziz itzultzeko da. Hori beharrezkoa da IP 4 bertsioan (IPv4), gaur erabiltzen den Interneteko protokoloaren maila ohikoena, IP helbidea 32 biteko luzera du, baina MAC helbideak 48 biteko luzera du.<br/><br/>ARP-k Open Systems Interkonexiorako ereduaren 2. eta 3. mailen artean funtzionatzen du. MAC helbidea OSI ereduaren 2. geruzan dago, datuen lotura-geruza, eta IP helbidea 3 geruzan dagoen bitartean, sare-geruza.<br/><br/>ARP ere erabil daiteke IP beste LAN teknologia batzuetarako, hala nola token eraztuna, zuntz banatutako datu-interfazea (FDDI) eta IPa kutxazainetan.<br/><br/>IPv6an, 128-biteko helbideak erabiltzen dituena, ARP ordezkatu dute bizilagunek aurkikuntzarako protokoloa.<br/><br/>Nola funtzionatzen du RPA-k<br/><br/>Ordenagailu berri bat LAN batean sartzen denean, identifikaziorako eta komunikaziorako IP helbide bakarra esleitzen da. LAN batean horrelako makina baterako sarrera-pakete bat sartzen denean, pasabideak IP helbidearekin bat datorren MAC helbide bat aurkitzeko eskatzen du. ARP cachea izeneko taula batek IP helbide bakoitzaren erregistroa eta dagokion MAC helbidea mantentzen ditu.<br/><br/>IPv4 Ethernet sare bateko sistema eragile guztiek dute RPA cachea, host-aren helbidea beste hostalari bidaltzeko eskatzen duen bakoitzean, bere RPA cache-a egiaztatuko du ea IP helbidea dagoen itzulpen-prozesua egiteko. Hala egiten badu, ez da derrigorrezkoa ARPAren eskaera berria. Itzulpena dagoeneko ez badago, sare-helbideen eskaera bidaliko da eta ARP egiten da.<br/><br/>ARP-k eskaera-pakete bat bidaltzen die LANeko makina guztiei, eta jakin badaki zein den IP helbidea. Makina batek IP helbidea bere bezala onartzen duenean, erantzun bat bidaltzen dio ARPAk etorkizuneko erreferentzia eguneratzeko eta komunikazioarekin jarraitzeko.<br/><br/>Bere IP helbidea ez dakiten host makinek alderantzizko RPA (RP) protokoloa erabil dezakete aurkikuntzarako.<br/><br/>ARP cachearen tamaina mugatua da eta aldizka sarrera guztiak garbitu egiten dira libre izateko; hain zuzen ere, katxean geratzen dira minutu gutxi batzuetan. Ohiko eguneratzeek sareko beste gailu batzuk ikusteko aukera ematen dute, host fisiko batek eskatzen duen IP helbidea aldatzen duenean. Garbiketa-prozesuan, alferrikako sarrerak ezabatu egiten dira, baita gaur egun erabiltzen ez diren ordenagailuekin komunikatzeko ahalegin bidegabeak ere.<br/><br/>ARP tolesketa eta ARP cachea pozoitzea<br/><br/>RPA erabiltzen duen edozein LAN-ek artatu behar du, halaber, ARPAren pozoinatzeko edo RPA-ren kasetoi gisa ezagutzen dena. ARP sofing eraso bat da, non hacker batek RPA mezu faltsuak irrati bidez emititzen dituen, erasotzailearen MAC helbidea sareko ordenagailu legitimo baten edo zerbitzariaren IP helbidearekin lotzeko. Esteka bat ezarri ondoren, xede-ordenagailuak jatorrizko ordenagailuaren direktorioetara bidal ditzake, bai eta IP legezko fitxategira ere.<br/><br/>ARPAren belakiek eragin larriak izan ditzakete enpresetan. Formarik sinpleenean erabiltzen direnean, ARPAren sofing-ek informazio sentikorra lapurtu dezakete.Hala ere, erasoak horiz harago joan daitezke eta beste eraso maltzur batzuk erraztu, besteak beste: |
