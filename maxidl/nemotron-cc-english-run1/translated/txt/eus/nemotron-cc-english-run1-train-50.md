| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | Ondorioa: Hozteko kaskoak erabiltzea eskolako futboleko Garuneko Kalteen aurka borrokatzeko<br/><br/>Kevin Jackson jokalari ohiak garuneko hozte teknologia erabiltzen du lesio traumatikoen eta kirol-kontsumitzaileen eraginak murrizteko.<br/>1994an Illinoiseko Unibertsitatean lan egiten hasi zen, eta, egun horietan, hainbat lesio izan zituen bere gorputzean, baina, horrez gain, hainbat ondorio diagnostikatu gabe ere izan zituen.

| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Masaje terapia<br/><br/>Masajea antzinako herri askotan gertatzen zen, Antzinako greziarrek, egiptoarrek, txinatarrek eta indiarrek barne, masajearen propietate terapeutikoak konbentzitu zituzten eta gaixotasun desberdinak tratatzeko erabili zen.<br/><br/>Masaje terapia pertsona baten muskuluak eta beste ehun bigunak ekipatzeko edo manipulatzeko praktika da, haien ongizatea edo osasuna hobetzeko.

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Akatsak gertatzen dira, eta kreditua berreraikitzean bide luzea izan daiteke.<br/><br/>Erosketa saskia erabilgarria da honako hau duten pertsonentzat:<br/><br/>1.

| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring.

Kasu honetan, auto hau da, eta kartelaren ardatz nagusia, pixka bat gehiago hitz egingo dugu artikuluaren bigarren puntuan. Baina zure begiek ikusmenaren zati jakin bati estuki erakartzen bazaituzte, nondik ikusten duzu? Hori galdera gogorra da hasi, baina erantzun sinple bat izango litzateke: non begiak zu zuzentzen dituzu. Eta zure begiradak eramaten zaitu, non diseinatzaileak lerroak erabiltzen dizkizun maketaziotik zuzentzera. Kasu honetan, lerro nagusia ezkerrean dagoen testua ondo finkatzen du eta, gainera, kartelaren fokura eramaten zaitu.<br/><br/>Maiz, lerro agerikoagoak izan daitezke hemen, gezi, fluxu-diagramak zuzenean erabiliz eta informazio eta sekuentziak azaltzeko oso metodo erabilgarriak dira.<br/><br/>2. Sortu fokua zure diseinu-konposizioan<br/><br/>Diseinu-konposizioaren funtsezko elementua da foku sendoa izatea.Ez du axola zenbat elementu duzun zure diseinuan, estutu eta erakutsi behar duzu ikuslea, hori da zure piezaren zati garrantzitsuena. Kasu honetan, artistak kolorea, kontrastea eta eskala erabili zituen espazioa antolatzeko eta fokua sortzeko. Beraz, zure fokua zure adierazpen garrantzitsuena eta mezu zure audientziari ere izango litzateke!<br/><br/>3. Erabili hierarkia<br/><br/>Zure foku-puntua sortu ondoren, zure diseinu-konposizioaren gainerako elementuekin zer egin behar duzun adierazi behar duzu.Beraz, elementu horiek ere egituratzen dituzu, eta lehentasun bat ezarri. Adibide honetan, argazkian dagoen gizona da fokua. Ondoren, gertaeraren izen bat bilatu behar dugu, dena dena dena. Horren ondoren, informazio gehigarriaren bila jarrai dezakegu, hala nola, goiburuak, datak, zenbakiak, etab.<br/><br/>Informazioko erakunde hau tamaina, kolorea, pisua deritzo.<br/><br/>4. Erabili elementu osagarriak<br/><br/>Beti saiatu zure diseinu osoan bakartuta.Ez da ideia ona hainbat iturritako irudiak nahasteko eta konbinatzeko, haien artean antzekotasunik gabe. Horrek ikuslearen begiak bakarrik nekatuko ditu eta nahastuko ditu.<br/><br/>Web diseinu hau irudien arteko koherentziaren adibide bikaina da, guztiak kolore-oinarri bat dute eta objektua erdian kokatzen dira. Noski, zure diseinu-soluzioa proiektuaren beharren araberakoa izango litzateke.<br/><br/>Kasu honetan, ikusleak erosketan erraz ezagutu eta bideratu nahi du, beste inolako gorabeherarik gabe. Gainera, goiko irudiaren eta kolorearen eskemaren sentsazioa produktuen atzeko planoan ere errepikatzen da, beraz, hau da, konbinazio polit bat diseinuko atalen artean!<br/><br/>5. Elementu errepikatuak<br/><br/>Askotan, zure proiektuak orri bat baino gehiago izango dira.Zure diseinu-atal batetik beste batera elementu zehatzak errepikatzen badituzu, ikusleari diseinuan zehar bere burua orientatzen lagunduko diozu.<br/><br/>Elementu errepikariak askotan gai jakin bat sortzeko erabiltzen dira, baita berriro ere, diseinu-konposizioa laguntzen dute "elkarrekin batzeko".<br/><br/>Erabil ditzakezun elementu errepikagarrien batzuk hauek dira: motibo grafikoak, mota, zure proiektuaren orrialdeetan zehar berrerabilitako diseinu zehatzak.<br/><br/>6. oreka elementuak<br/><br/>Diseinu-konposizioan bi oreka mota daude: simetrikoa eta asimetrikoa. Lehenengoak antzeko elementuak erabiltzen ditu, ardatz baten bi aldeetatik (lerro ikusgai edo ez ikusgaia). Oreka simetrikoa oso garbia eta dotorea da, baina, batzuetan, aspergarria izan daiteke, beraz, diseinatzaileek oreka asimetrikoa nahiago dute. Jakina, eszena honetan ez dugu tamainako elementu berdinik izango, antzeko moduan.<br/><br/>Hemen, elementuen tamaina desberdinak ikusten ditugu, testurak eta abar. Diseinu-elementuetan pentsatzen laguntzen du, "pisua" izanik. Adibidez, kuia handi bat, "handia" samarra baduzu, hainbat lerro horizontal eta objektu txikiagorekin egin dezakezu, objektuaren kontrako aldean.<br/><br/>7. Lerrokatu elementuak<br/><br/>Lerrokatzea beste tresna garrantzitsu bat da, diseinu-konposizioan erabiltzeko eta elementuak antolatzeko. Askotan, mota, kolore, irudi, goiburu eta azpiatal asko badituzu. Tresna asko daude webgunean, eta horri esker, objektuak ahoz adierazi eta elkarren arteko elementuak lerrokatzen lagundu dezakegu, ez baitago lekurik pieza flotagarrietarako eta diseinu soilerako. Lerrokatzeak ikuspegi dotorea dakarzkion. Diseinu asimetrikoek ere antzeko edukien blokeen lerrokatze eta egitura batzuk dituzte.<br/><br/>Oro har, testu-bloke luze bat duzunean, lerrokatzeak begiari errazago kentzen lagunduko liokete, kontzeptu honen bistaratze bikaina baita.<br/><br/>8. Erabili kontrastea<br/><br/>Kontraste bat arreta erakartzeko erabiltzen da. Elementu baten kontrastea areagotzen baduzu, hau gertatuko da. Aitzitik, azpiko elementuak erabiliz gero, desagertu egingo dira eta “desagertzen” izango dira.<br/><br/>Hemen, kontrasteak forma arkitektoniko sendoak, geometrikoak eta argiak eta itzalak azpimarratzen ditu. Ez azken tokian, irudi txikia beste elementu batzuekin alderatuta, baina ikusi eta ondo geratzen da forma handia, kontrako aldean, ezkerreko ertzean.<br/><br/>9. Erabili espazio zuria<br/><br/>Gune zuria ez da egokia diseinu-konposizioan argitasuna emateko. Espazio zuria ez da “espazio hutsa”, baizik eta behar den elementu bat, zure diseinua arnasa hartzeko aukera ematen du.<br/><br/>Adibidez, argazki honetan, espazio zuri guztiak (beste elementu batzuek) emakumearengan eta bere jarreran arreta jartzen laguntzen du. Uste al duzu emakume honi arreta emango diotela? Zure gela zuriaren garrantzia ulertzen laguntzeko, nola sentitzen zinatekete ate batetik ohera pasatzea besterik ez baduzu eta dena objektuz josita dago? Nola sentituko zenuke, zure oheak gela osoa betetzen ez badu eta ez badago leku guztian objekturik. Bai, ideia guztiak lortuko ditugu, baita diseinua ere.<br/><br/>10.Diseinu-mota ulertzea eta erabiltzea<br/><br/>Ikusiko dugun lehena azken urteetan web diseinatzaileentzat oso ezaguna izan den diseinu bisual, argazki edo diseinu bisual deitzen zaiona da. Itxura dotorea, garbia, normalean kalitate handiko produktua edo zerbitzua eskaintzen du, argazki erakargarria. Zuk iradoki dezakezun bezala, ez da albiste-guneetarako erabiltzen, non informazio asko dago aurkezteko.Hemen funtsezko esaldia kalitatea da kantitatearen gainetik.<br/><br/>Diseinu mota honen funtsezko elementuak espazio zuria eta tipoa dira.<br/><br/>Beste diseinu mota bat Z diseinua da, ikuslearen begia diseinuko elementu batetik bestera eramaten duena.<br/><br/>Adibide honetan, lehenik eta behin argazkia ikusten dugu, gure begiek ikusmenaren eskuineko aldean jartzen dute testua, eta gero eskaneatzen jarraitzen dugu, ikusizko testutik hasita. Z diseinuek erritmoa sortzen dute eta web gunean erabiltzen dira informazio askorekin, non erabiltzailea eta "gida" bilatu behar dituzu.<br/><br/>Gauzak ondo mantentzeko beste modu bat, garbia eta antolatua da urrezko ratioa edo hirugarrenaren araua erabiltzea. Gure artikuluan gehiago irakur dezakezu argazki harrigarriak egiteko, printzipio bera argazkigintzari aplikatzen zaion bitartean. Azken batean, zure diseinua hirugarrenetan banatzen du, bai bertikalean, bai horizontalean, eta lerro horiek zeharkatzen dituzten elementu garrantzitsuenak jartzen ditu, zure diseinua ikusgarriagoa izango da.<br/><br/>Hona hemen MailChimpen webgunea.Kontuan izan nola tximinoaren izaera apur bat dela ezkerreko? Badirudi ondo! Oh, eta beste gauza bat baino gehiago – pertsonaia bat espazioan zehar mugitzen denean, mugitu ezkerrera.<br/><br/>11. Sortu mugimendua<br/><br/>Mugimendua leku edo kokapen aldaketa bat da, ahalegin bat izan daiteke edo irudiaren zati antolatu daitezke, ikusleak mugimendu zentzua izan dezan lerroak, formak, testurak eta abar erabiliz.<br/><br/>Antzinatik, gure begiak erakargarriak dira oraindik objektuak mugitzera, eta hori garrantzitsua izan zen norberaren biziraupenerako - ehizan eta animalietatik babesteko. Horregatik, jendeak oso erakartzen ditu mugimendua irudikatzen duten irudiak eta, hurrenez hurren, elementu "fluxu" polita duen konposizio bat zailagoa da.<br/><br/>12.Truingak bezalako pertsonak<br/><br/>Triangeluaren formak interesak sortzen ditu, norabide bat ezartzen du eta mugimendua sortzen du. Ziur, oso forma sendoa da eta diseinatzaile eta artistek beren diseinua nahiz diseinua antolatzeko erabiltzen dute, eta ez elementu bisual gisa. Azken urteotan, oso ezaguna egin zen diseinu poligonalarekin.<br/><br/>13. Sinplifikazioa<br/><br/>Sinplifikazioa da adierazpen bisuala babesten duten oinarrizko elementuei konposizio bat murrizteko teknika.<br/><br/>Pieza bakoitza berdin garrantzitsua bada, orduan pieza bakoitza berdinik gabekoa da. Nathan Fowes<br/><br/>Begiak xehetasunak begiratzeko naturala da, baina oso zaila da diseinua osotasun gisa ikustea eta elementu guztiek elkarrekin lan egiten duten modua ikustea. Zalantzarik gabe, zure diseinu-konposizioan elementu hobeak kendu, gehitu eta haientzat leku bat aurkitu nahian. Badakigu gela bat dela, baina oraindik ez dago "gutxiago"!<br/><br/>14. Begiratu non daude zure elementuak ertzekin lotuta<br/><br/>Sarritan diseinatzaileak ikusiko dituzu, maketa baten ertzen inguruan espazio beltza erabiliz, eta, aldi berean, diseinua arnasteko, itxura naturala izango dute, ertzak inguratuz eta itzaltzera iristen diren elementuak ikusteko. Zure diseinuko ertzen inguruan lanpeturik badago, batez ere zerbait astunekoa izango litzateke, handia eta elementu nagusiaren arretatik urrunduko da.<br/><br/>Kasu honetan, diseinatzaileak forma abstraktu eta handia erabili zuen, izena eta urtea adierazteko. Forma begia zuzentzen ari delako, lodieran askotarikoa denez eta mugimendua duelako, ez du ikuslea gainezkatzen, baizik eta alderantziz, bere plazer estetikoa eta sinpletasuna eskaintzen ditu.<br/><br/>15. Burua trantsizioak<br/><br/>Diseinu-konposizioko trantsizioa pixka bat zailagoa da definitzeko.Errepirazioa dagoeneko eztabaidatu dugu, trantsizioak forma batetik bestera igarotzen du, begia puntu batetik bestera eramanez. Askotan, diseinatzaileek lerro eta forma kurbatuak erabiltzen dituzte forma eta eduki-blokeen trantsizio leunarekin.Transmisioak begia eta "malguki leuna" diseinua erlaxatzen laguntzen du.<br/><br/>Inspirazioren bat bilatzen duzu?<br/><br/>Diseinu-konposizioaren osagai garrantzitsuenei buruzko zerbait ikasten duzunean, galeria txiki bat egin genuen, diseinu-konposizioarekin. |

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Memory CD8 + T zelulak oinarrizkoak dira sistema immunologikoarenak, ondorengo irain inmunologikoetatik babesteko. Transkripzio-arau askok eta T zelulen jatorrizko eta memoriarekin lotutako seinale-kate prospekzio-kasu batzuk deskribatu dituzte eta memoria immunologikoak sortzen duen prozesua asko jakinarazi dute. Transkripzio-faktorearen adierazpenean eta zitokinearen eskakizunetan desberdintasun argiak egon arren, antisorgailuek sortutako seinale-trantsizio globala guztiz ezezaguna da eta, beraz, gure ezagutza oinarrian hutsune nabarmena adierazten du. Funtsezko seinale-gertaera bat, CTR estimulazioari erantzuteko erabiltzen dena, proteinetan tiro-isuria sortzen duten arroken aktibazioa da. Hori dela eta, T zelulen jatorrizko eta memoriaren arteko fotolisi-sareekin alderatuta, gaixotasunari eta txertoaren eraginkortasunari erantzun positiboa emateko C8+ T zelula-neurketaren helburuak identifikatuko dira. Proposamen espezifiko honen helburua memoria CD8 + T-zelulak simulatzeko bakarrak diren barne-seinalearen bideak zehaztea da. Gure hipotesia da seinaleen ekoizpen bide bereizgarriak CD8+ T zelula erantzuna arautzen dutela. Proposatutako lanarekiko premisa arrazional eta zientifikoa da, oro har, T zeluletan gertatzen diren aldaketak kontuan hartzea, hots, errazagoa dela txerto eta sendagaien diseinua gaixotasunei eta infekzioari aurre egiteko. Gure hipotesi nagusia honako helburu zehatzekin probatuko dugu: 1) CD8+ nabean eta memoria-gelaxketan gertatzen diren TCV seinaleen transdukzio-aldaketak zehaztu. Tintazko seinaleztapen-sareak profilatzeko, oso sentikorra den analisi geometriko bat erabiliko dugu, zarata, indarra eta memoriari buruzko CD8 + T-zelulak garatu ditugu. Aurretiko pantaila batean oinarrituta, zera antzematen dugu: Jack2 hiperfosforizatua dela, gogorarazten duen erantzunaren funtsezko bitartekaria dela adieraziz.Jak2 hiperaktibitateak memoria-erantzunetarako kritikoa dela frogatuko dugu. Horretarako, Aim1ek seinale-sare berriak identifikatuko ditu, CD8+ memoria-erantzunari laguntzen diotenak, eta 2oC-tan CEB lotzeko proteina (CPB) duten propultsazioa definituko du memoria-sare elektronikoak erregulatzen dituen etengailu molekular gisa, CD8+ T zelulen bidez. Gure aurretiazko datuak kontuan hartuta, non CD8+ memoriako T zelulen eraketari lotutako seinale-bide bakarrak aurkitu genituen, arreta berezia jartzen dugu memoriaren CD8+ T zeluletan, Jak2ren aktibazio-prozesua KP-ren transmisio-paisaia bakarra sustatzeko. BPBren fosforoa identifikatuko dugu transkripzio-faktoreen nahasketak nola arautzen dituen, hala nola CREB eta MYB. Gainera, ikuspegi genetiko bat hartuko dugu CPB funtzioak CD8+ memoria-gelaxkak eta CD8+ memoria-erantzunak sortzeko. Helburu honetan lortutako datuak tresna berritzaile bat sortuko da, zeinak CD8+ T zelulen memoriari lotutako aldaketak programa transkripzio bakarrak nola gidatzen diren azaltzen duen.<br/><br/>Osasun publikoaren garrantzia<br/><br/>Hemen proposatzen diren azterlanek zehaztuko dute, masa espektroaren bidez, oro har memoriaren CD8 + T gelaxketan gertatzen diren seinale-trantsizioko gertaerak, nabearen CD8+ T gelaxkarekin alderatuta. Zelula hauek bigarren mailako infekziotik babesteko funtsezko zeregina dutelako, ezinbestekoa da zelula horiek giza osasunerako funtsezkoak diren mekanismo molekularrak ulertzea. |
