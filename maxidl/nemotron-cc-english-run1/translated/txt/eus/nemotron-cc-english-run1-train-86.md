| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Leclaer auzo historikoa, garai batean Edwardsville-ren "hegoaldera" deitzen zena, komunitate kooperatibista gisa sortu zen 1890ean, eta 1934an Eastville hiriari atxiki zitzaion. Estatu Batuetan eta Europan zehar egindako prentsa eta aldizkariak, batez ere bere bizitzako lehen 20 urteetan jakinaraziak. 1979an, bere historia bereziagatik, antzinako herria leku historikoen erregistro Nazionalean agertu zen.<br/><br/>Nelson Oliver Nelsonek sortu zuen, eta urte askoan lan-klasearen irudia hobetu nahi zuen. Nelsonek langileen lan baldintzak hobetu nahi zituen, eta lantegietatik gertu zeuden langileek eta familiek erraz parte hartu ahal izan zuten doako aisialdirako eta hezkuntza-programetan. 1890. urte baino lehen, St. Louis, N. Nelson enpresaren fabrikazio eta banaketa negozioek irabazi zuten hezkuntza eta jolas aukera ugari eskainiz. Leclae kooperatibak prestazio osagarriak ekarriko zituen.<br/><br/>Nelsonek landa-eremuko kokaleku batera eraman nahi zutela adierazi zuenean, enpresa-ordezkariak hainbat hiritan hurbildu ziren, St. Louis-en egoitzatik gertu. Edwardsvilleko hegoaldean, lur-trakzioa aurkitu zuten, ura, ikatza eta garraioa sartzeko. Enpresa lokalak azkar ekin zion finantza-pizgarri bat eskaintzeko. Hiru aste baino gutxiagotan, komunitateak 200.000 $-ko funts bat sortu zuen $ 1 eta 1,000 artean banakako ekarpenetatik Nelsonek bere enpresarentzat Edwardsville aukeratu dezan.<br/><br/>Hiriko buruzagiek Eduardosville hiriaren mugen barruan zeuden jabetza aurkitzea espero zuten, baina leku egokirik ez balego, ziur zeuden Nelsonen hegoaldeko inbertsioa laster bihurtuko zela Edwardsville-ren parte. Nelsonek bere kontratuaren eraikuntzan eta enplegua sortzeko kontingentzia guztiak bete baditu ere, 44 urte lehenago izango litzateke Edwardsville-ra atxiki aurretik. Leclaire, Madison/Browne etorbideak ekialdera doaz, eta mendebaldera, Hadley/McKinley etorbideak iparraldean eta Wolf Street kalea iparraldean, 1890etik 1934ra bitartean hiri independentea izaten jarraitzen zuen. Garai hartan, enpresa-, hezkuntza- eta bizitegi-plangintzako berrikuntzak saritu ziren.<br/><br/>Leclaire herria, 1931ko Edwardsvilleko mapa batean<br/>Paul Jenkins-en idazlana<br/><br/>Nelsonek herri bat eraikitzeko erabakia hartu zuen. 1880ko hamarkadaren amaieran nazioarteko buruzagi izan zen lankidetzan eta irabazi-asmorik gabeko eremuan, eta teoria sozialak trukatu zituen mundu osoan zehar, bere St. Louis enpresaria zabaltzeko bitartean. Jean Leclairek bere herri esperimentala izendatu zuen, baina informazioa eta inspirazioa eman zuten beste hainbat gizarte-ikuskeratara joan zen. Adibide horietatik abiatuta, Nelsonek Leclaire sortu zuen, bere hitzetan, "lanari eman, inteligentzia eman, aisia sustatu, edertasun sustatu, etxea sortu eta etxeak egin". Hauek guztiak gizon-emakumeen alde egiteko behar ziren erabaki zuten, bizitza betetzeko. Gerora, autoreek hitz hauek erabili zituzten Lecaireren oinarriak formulatzeko: lana, etxea, hezkuntza, jolasa eta edertasuna, baina askatasunaren printzipio osagarriarekin.<br/><br/>Lana<br/><br/>Lan egin ahal izateko, faktore garrantzitsuenak izan ziren, Leclaireko lantegi lanik gabe, ez baitzen herrixkarik egongo. A. Cameron arkitektoak diseinatu zuen adreiluzko lantegiko eraikinak, udan argi naturala, aireztapena eta neguko solairu klimatizatuak eskaintzeko. Suteak kentzeko sistema bat zegoen, eta, industria istripurik izan ez bazen ere, ahalegin guztiak egin ziren langileen segurtasuna bermatzeko. 1894. urtean, New York World Reporterrek "Gizonaren perfekzio ezin hobea" izenarekin deitu zituen hainbat belar eta lore lorategiz inguratuta zeuden, campus antzeko itxura bat emanez.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Manufacturing enpresaren fabrikazio-koplexua Leclaire<br/>Lecleaireren lagunetatik<br/><br/>Nelson enpresako politikak langileen finantza egonkortasuna babesteko diseinatu ziren. Langileek irabazi-kuota irabaz dezakete eta enpresan ahots bat izan dezakete aukera hori aukeratuz gero. Irabazi-partekatze-plana Nelsonen langileei eman zitzaien laguntza-lan gutxi batzuk egin zituzten urteetan, baina gehienak ez ziren oso arraroak. Langileek ere denbora eta soldata lehiakorrak izan zituzten. Pentsioetarako eta bajarako emandako diru-funtsa zegoen, baita alarguntza-pentsioa ere, langilea hil bada edo bere lanarekin zerikusia izan ez bazuen.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson konpainiarentzat (NOCO) egoitza nagusia St. Louisen egon zen, baina N. O. Nelson Manufacturing konpainia osoa Leclairera joan zen. 1900ean, saltokiak enpresa independenteak ziren, baina denak N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company enpresaren jabetzakoak ziren. Merkataritza-establezimenduen artean, zurezko produktuak fabrikatzera zihoazen. Hemen lan egiten zuten artisauek kontratu bereziak bete zituzten, banku lokal baterako kaiolak barne, eta aldare bat erabiltzen jarraitzen dute Edwardsville-ko St Andrew's episceptor-en Elizan. Marmolezko Dendan espezializatutako marmol arkitektonikoa dago, eta Nelsonen etxe, negozio eta estatu-hiriburuek moztu eta instalatu zuten Midwest-en. Makina-denda, Bigall eta Keeler izan zena, pipa mozteko makinak, ponpak, garajeak eta hainbat tresna mekaniko egin zituzten iturgintza-merkataritzan, eta Leclaire Bizikletaren fabrikatzera bultzatu zituzten, 1890eko hamarkadaren erdialdean. Letoizko Denda horretan hainbat tresna eta hodi fabrikatzen ziren, Leclarreko lantegietako lan batzuk besterik ez ziren. Konpainiaren logoa "ONCO" dotorea zen, eta oraindik ere ikus daitezke hainbat su-hargailutan eta Edwardsville-n.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Etxebizitza bat eraiki baino lehen, etxebizitza bat behar zen lantegiko eraikinak osatzeko eta etxeak eraikitzeko. Behar horiei erantzuteko, "Club Etxea" eraiki zuten, hainbat helburutarako. Ostatuaz gain, komunitatearen hezkuntza lehen eraikina izan zen, eta ondo zaindutako liburutegia izan zuen.<br/><br/>Leclarreko bizitegi-zatiaren eraikuntza, 1890ko ekainean sortu zen. Julius Pizman, Leclaireko lehen loteak jarri zituen paisaia-arkitektura berritzailea, babes-kongresio ugari zituena. Kale zabal, kurbatu eta handiak, eta etxebizitza edo hezkuntza helburuak mugatzen dituen murrizketa txiki bat. Konpainiak kaleak altxatu zituen, kale-argi elektrikoak eskaini, alboko pasabideak instalatu eta ehunka zuhaitz landatu zituen Leclaire auzoko kaleetan zehar. Ondoren, Leclaireko sekzioak diseinu konbentzional batekin eta lote txikiago batekin jarri ziren, baina hala ere murrizketa handiak izan ziren.<br/><br/>Leclaire Victorian etxea 1907an<br/>Cindy Reinhardt-etik<br/><br/>Hasieran, enpresak eraiki zituen etxeak, eta, ondoren, Nelsonen etxera saldu zen. Langile batek gaixotu eta ezin izan balu bere hipoteka bertan behera utzi, lanera bueltatu arte. Etxeak hainbat etxe-diseinutan eskaini zituzten, eta enpresa konturatu zen ez zirela bi etxebizitzak berdin zirela, batez ere hasierako etxeak, elektrizitatearekin eta martxan jarri ziren urarekin. Ondoren, Bungalowak, lau plazak eta zenbait kit etxe ere erosi ahal izan zituzten egoiliarrek etxe bat eraikitzeko edo asko erosteko eta etxe bat eraikitzeko, diseinu arkitektonikoak enpresaren estandarrak betez.<br/><br/>Urte batzuk geroago, asko saldu zitzaizkien inbertitzaileei, normalean Edwardsvilleko bizilagunak, eta 1920ko hamarkadan etxebizitza asko eraiki ziren tokiko kontratistek, gero inguruetara saldu zituztenak.<br/><br/>Hezkuntza<br/><br/>Nelsonek heziketan sinesten zuen, lan-klasea barne. Hezkuntza-programa 1892an hasi zen eta eraikin berri horretan jarraitu zuen 722 Holyoake Road-en. Ikastetxe Etxea" deitu ohi zuen eraikin honek bilerak eta programak egiteko areto handi bat eskaintzen zuen, baina egunean zehar gela barruan kokatzeko partizio mugikorrak zituen. Arratsaldeetan, Leclear Self- Culture Clubeko dantzak, topaketak edo egitarauak egon ziren, Washingtongo Unibertsitateko irakasleen edo National Geographic-en hitzaldiekin, N. O. Nelsonen kasu, mendearen hasieran gizarte-mugimenduaren parte ziren. Horien artean daude Jane Addams, Edward Everett Halle, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones eta Charlotte Perkins Gillman, besteak beste.<br/><br/>1913. urtean matrikulatuta dauden haurrak<br/>Cindy Reinhardt-etik<br/><br/>Jardueraren eraikuntza 1895eko hamarkadan hainbat hezkuntza esperimentu egin ziren, besteak beste, eskola industrial, unibertsitateko, gaueko eskola eta akademia bat. Bizitzarik zaharrena eta luzeena izan zen, 1892an, Fröbel eredua erabiltzen zuena. Bi urteko programa hau doakoa izan zen guztiontzat, eta 1931ra arte, finantza-arrazoiengatik, enpresak langileen seme-alabak ez zituen ikasleei prestakuntza ematen hasi zen. 1934. urtera arte, Nelson Manufacturing-ek kkulta bat egin zuen, eraikina Edwardsville-ko eskola-barrutira pasatu zenean, kuota nominalaren truke.<br/><br/>Errepikapena<br/><br/>1915ean Leclaire lakuko itsasontziak<br/>Cindy Reinhardt-etik<br/><br/>Aisia Lecleaireren ezaugarri garrantzitsu bat izan zen: kirol instalazioak eman zituen beisbolean, tenisean eta gero, futbolean. Ontzigintza-areto bat eraiki zen eta izotz-pista bat zegoen neguan. Leclare Park txalupaz, gizon eta emakume bainu etxeez eta pabiloi handi batez hornituta zegoen. Dantzak, oporrak, erleak eta beste jarduera batzuk antolatu zituzten eta konpainiak normalean herriko entretenimenduetan edo Edwardsville-n jokatu ohi zuen banda babestu zuen. Club House eta Ikastetxeen funtzio didaktikoak bezala, Lecaireren aisialdirako instalazioak guztientzako ireki ziren, eta maiz Edwardsville eta St. Louis bisitatzen zituzten.<br/><br/>Edertasuna<br/><br/>Leclaire lakuaren lehen argazkia<br/>Cindy Reinhardt-etik<br/><br/>Nelsonen azken faktoreak oso garrantzitsuak ziren inguruarekiko. Nelsonek jakin zuen bizitza osasuntsuaren garrantzia. Espainian aurki daitekeen edertasun eta garbitasun balioetsi zituen, eta Lelicen guztiok animatu zuten beren jabegoa landatzeko baratze eta baratzetan landatzeko. Nelsonek, esate baterako, berotegi-efektuko enpresa batek doako loreak eta lehiaketak eskaini zituen urte ederrenetarako. Leclaire jarri zen abian herri osoa oraindik ikusgarri egon zedin.<br/><br/>Askatasuna<br/><br/>Lecleaire kooperatibo denda<br/>Cindy Reinhardt-etik<br/><br/>Nelsonek bost fundazio-oinarri argitaratu zituen Leclairerentzat, baina idazle modernoek seigarrena gehitu dute: askatasuna, enpresak eskaintzen dituen programa guztiak bertako langileei zein bertako bizilagunei eskuragarri zeuden, baina ez ziren beharrezkoak. Enpresetako programetan parte hartu ala ez erabakitzeko askatasuna guztiz beharrezkoa zen Nelson Manufacturingerako edo beste nonbaiterako lan egin ahal izatea, eta langileak ez ziren Lleidara bizitzera behartuta egon. Aisialdiko eta hezkuntzako programetan parte hartzea ere aukerakoa izan zen, eta bertan langileak eros zitezkeen, baina beste hiri batzuk ez bezala, enpresa-dendari zor zitzaion. Leclaire denda kooperatiba bat zen, non bazkideen merkatu-prezioak kobratzen ziren, baina orduan hiruhileroko dibidenduak ordaindu ziren.<br/><br/>ezberdina den enpresa-hiria<br/><br/>Prestazio horiek guztiak Lecaire enpresaren beste herri batzuetakoak dira, baina kasu indibidualak ere izan ziren, non enpresak errukia eta langileen arreta erakutsi zituen. Enpresak lantegiak itxi eta txangoak egin zituen langileei eta haien senideei St. Louisi egun batez joateko, St. Louis World's Fair-en. Dirua estu zegoenean, Nelsonek noizean behin ordaindu beharko zuen diru gehigarria ordainduko zuen langile bakoitzarentzat, eta programa bat antolatu zuen gizonekin ados ez egoteko, eta sarritan ez bezala, Nelsonek bere burua itzuliko zuen.<br/><br/>1841ean jaio zen Lillesand hirian, N. O. Nelson, enpresa libre batean sinesten zuen militantea zen, baina baita sozialista, "Urrezko Araua"ren jarraitzailea ere, eta Gerra Zibilean Batasunerako kide izan zen. 1900. urtean, multimilioi bat izan zen, baina, 1922. urtean hil zenean, langile klasearen hobekuntzari uko egin zion.<br/><br/>Nahiz eta Leclaire ez zen Nelsonen gizarte esperimentu bakarra, arrakasta handiena izan zen. Gizarte-gosea hobetzeko beste ahalegin garrantzitsu batzuk New Orleanseko sukaldaritza-denda kooperatiboen kate bat dira, bere Bessemer, Alabama, lantegiak eta India, Kalifornia, kontsumorako etxe bat.<br/><br/>Nelsonen Leclair herria nazioartean ezaguna zen esperimentu garrantzitsu eta arrakastatsu gisa. Une askotan deskribatu zen New York World-en, baina, batez ere, 1894an, Nellie Bly-ren txostenaren arabera, "Lan- galdera konpondu eta egoera zoriontsua dagoen herri txiki batean". Los Angeles Times-ek N. O. Nelsonen maiz jakinarazi zuen, Chicago Daily Tribune eta beste hainbat argitalpenetan bezala.<br/><br/>1915ean Leclaireren 15. urteurreneko ospakizunean honakoa esan zuen Nelsonek: «Lecleairek ostalaritza ireki batera hedatzen da, eta egunero gozatzen dugun erosotasuna eta edertasunaz gozatzen da». Mende bat baino gehiago igaro da egun horretatik, baina gonbidapena mantentzen da oraindik. Bertan egoiliarrek eta ikertzaileek Leclaireren historia ezagutzeko eta etorkizuneko belaunaldi hobeak hobetzeko ikas daitezkeen ikasgaiak ulertzeko gonbidapena egiten dute.<br/><br/>2019an fabrikazio konplexuaren lehengo eraikinetako bat izan zen, gaur egun N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Egileak Zoom edo Skype bidezko bisitak<br/><br/>Espero dut zure ikasleekin Zoom edo Skype bidez bisitatzea. Skype aukera bikaina da egile presentzialak ez diren eskola/klaseak, baina liburu eta poesia aztertu nahi dutenak, egile batekin konektatu eta banakako galderak egin.<br/><br/>Kostua<br/><br/>30-45 minutuko ibilbidea edo Skype saioak eskaintzen ditut saio bakoitzeko 125 $-ko eskolarekin (edo 200 $ goizeko hiru orduetan edo arratsaldez; $ 325 saioetarako egun batean; $ 425 saioetarako).

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Berriak Artxiboa<br/><br/>Liburu berriak GIB erronkei aurre egiteko moduak aztertzen ditu<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Dr. Dennis Francis Marjorie Gizaekin, liburuaren azala asmatu zuena, GIBari buruzko ekintza.<br/><br/>GIBaren pandemiak gizaki onenak eta txarrena ekarri ditu erantzunaren arabera.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Ondarearen Hitza Eguna: Aukera<br/><br/>Aukera: Akordio bat irekita mantentzeko, epe jakin baterako, ondasun higiezinen salmentarako edo alokairurako.

| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Larruazalerako karotenoideen onurak<br/><br/>Karotenoideoak entzun al dituzu?Fitokimiko indartsu hauek loreak, frutak eta kolore gorri eta laranjak ematen dituzten landareetan dauden osagai pigmentuak dira.<br/><br/>1930. hamarkadaz geroztik, zientzialariek 800 karoteno inguru identifikatu dituzte, eta horietatik 40 giza gorputzean daude, epidermisaren kanpo-geruza, dermisoa eta larruazalpeko gantza barne. Karotendio arruntenak beta-karotenoak, alfa-karotenoak, luteinak, zexantinak, lykopeak eta astathantinak dira.<br/><br/>Larruazaleko karotenideoen edukia hainbat faktorek eragiten dute, besteak beste, fruitu eta barazkien sarrera, hainbat elikagairen bioerabilgarritasuna, osagarria, UV erradiazioa, airearen kutsadura, alkoholaren kontsumoa, erretzea eta estresa.<br/><br/>Nola laguntzen dute karotenoidesek nire azala?<br/><br/>Karotenoideak larruazaleko antioxidatzaile ezagunenetako batzuk dira eta funtzio garrantzitsuak dituzte antiinflamatorioak diren agente gisa.<br/><br/>Zahartze osasungarria eta azala konpontzea<br/><br/>Antioxidatzaileak funtsezkoak dira larruazal osasungarrietarako, zelula erradikalen ondoriozko kalteak ekiditen laguntzen dutelako.Aztura erradikalak zahartze larria eragiten du eta hainbat minbizi mota sortzen ditu. Karotenoideak, E bitaminarekin, C bitaminarekin eta Q10 entzimarekin batera antioxidatzaile termiko garrantzitsuak dira.<br/><br/>Bere jarduera antioxidatzailea dela eta, karotenoideak larruazalaren kolageno eta elastina produkzioa sustatzen dute, larruazalaren dentsitatea, lodiera, elastikotasuna eta irmotasuna areagotzen laguntzen du. Kolagenoak eta elastikotasunak adina murrizten dute, eta, beraz, hortzetan nahikoa karotenoideak lortzea funtsezkoa da ondo zahartzea.<br/><br/>Karotenoideak argazkiak, larruazala kolorazioa, elastikotasuna, hidratazioa, testurak eta ur-galera zeharka dezake.<br/><br/>Astaxian, bereziki, kolageno eta elastina sortzeko fibroblastoak estimulatzen ditu, kolageno eta elastina deskonposatzen duten entzimaren jarduera inhibitzen du eta hanturaren aurkako eta UV iragazketaren aurkako efektuak erakusten ditu. Larruazaleko melanina murriztea erakutsi da, freckles eta melasma itxura gutxitzea lortzen duena.<br/><br/>Ozeanoen aurkako jarduera: karotenoen antiinflamatorioak, elurrekin lotutako hantura eta narritadura hondatzen laguntzen du. Larruazalaren konponketan eragile baliotsuak dira eta epidermiseko birsorkuntza estimulatzen dute, larruazala leun eta leungarria laguntzen dute.<br/><br/>Non aurkitu ditzaket karotenoak?<br/><br/>Bi modu daude zure eguneroko karotenoides-dosia lortzeko: dieta bidez eta aplikazio topikoaren bidez.Bien konbinazio egokia da ondo zahartzeari dagokionez.<br/><br/>Karotenoideak gantzgarriak dira, beraz, zure gorputzak gantza behar du xurgatzeko (tomak eta oliba olioa, brokolia eta gurina, edo espinaka eta ahuakatea). Elikagaietan karbonato iturri ohikoak avocado, arrautza gorringoak, kale, espinakak, azenarioak, patata gozoak, papaia eta tomateak dira.<br/><br/>Elikagaien osagarri ez diren nutrienteen eta antioxidatzaileen artean hartzea defendatzen dugun bitartean, azterlan batek frogatu zuen kolageno-hidrosastearekin batera estuki konbinatzen zela, ur-galera zeharkagarria murrizten zuela, eta I MNP motako kolagenoaren adierazpena areagotzen zuela.<br/><br/>Ikerketak erakusten dute giza larruazalean antioxidatzaileen kontzentrazio altuak edozein adinetan larruazaleko babes osasuntsua eskaintzen dutela.<br/><br/>Skarkonetan, karotenoideak, hala nola, calenula, delandionoa eta gehigarri osoak nahasten ditugu, olio hotzekin eta osagai funtzionalekin astathina bezala. Calendula bakarrik dago, 19 karoteno mota baino gehiago dituena. Horrek azal-zaintzan erabiltzeko historia luzea duela azaltzen du. Ikerketek erakusten dute ko-entzimarekin konbinatutako karotenoak bereziki eraginkorrak direla hantura murrizten eta larruazaleko zahartze goiztiarra saihesten laguntzen dutela eguzki-esplorazioaren ondorioz. |
