| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Norbait gorrotoaz jabetzea ezinezkoa dela aitortu arren, eta alderantziz, oso atsegina da argudioa begiratzea.

Mike D'Angelo ez bezala, hautsi gabeko espazio bat da, ikusleengana hurbiltzea eta haien arnasak modu kontzientean egitea ahalbidetzen duena kameraren eremu gisa; baina arakatzen ari den espazioa zeta eta distiratsua da CGI sorkuntza, eta kamera nahikorik gabe gelditzen da kamera edo ingurunea benetan bideo-joko bat ikusten hasten den bitartean.

Gure Film onenaren "CGI Gimmerack"-en sarreragatik aipatu zenuen Hugori, hau ezin hobea da... beste film baterako.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Izan ere, esan beharra dago kortxebikeek Hugo gai estandar baten inguruan eraiki duela: "bihotzez jotzea" haurrentzako liburu / filmen trama: Orphanek bere egunerokotasuna galdu egiten du, lagun berri bat bihurtzen du, kumen oinarritutako haur bat bihurtzen du eta, agian, hura ere, bere maitaletzat jotzen du. Baina hori eskeleto narratiboa baino ez da, eta Skadak haragi eta odolezko ugari eskaintzen ditu. Batetik, ezin duzu ikusi Hugo, mutil bakartia, erloju-dorretik Parisko tren geltokiko gotorlekuraino joaten dena, eta, beste mutil bakarti bat, bere logelako leihotik hasita, Elizabeth Street-en. Eta, nahiz eta lotura hori egiteko behar adina film ez izan, uste dut Hugoren ibilbidea ez dela aita-figura berri bat aurkitzea, baizik eta bere aitaren ondaretzat duen magiarekin jarraitzea. Hori da filma: ikuspegiaren iraunkortasunari esker, munduko irudi-bertsioa 24 esparrutan onartu dezakegu, bigarrenean, zientzia eta magia aldi berean. Hugok Melièsekin duen harremana ez da egun berri batera hurbiltzen, baizik eta ilusio komuna partekatzen ari den gizona inbidia batean murgilduta dago. Niri, hau da, askoz angelu bereziago bat merkataritza-gune potentzial batean.<br/><br/>Izan ere, zinema eta Meliès estudioak sortzen dituzten sekuentziak —Michael Stuhlbarg-ekin zinema-eskola heroiko ikertzaile bezala— triskatuta zeudela uste da. Ahalik eta modurik onenean sentitzen da, nire Historiako 101 klaseko konpresioa bezala, seihileko bateko klipak eta testuinguruak muntaketa eta animaziozko pop-up liburu baten artean ulertzea. Eta zinemaren diseinu zorrotzaz hitz egiten du, geruzak hain ondo islatzen dituena Méliès-en eta zinemaren jaiotzaren garai batean, eta aldi berean, bere burua seme-alaba gisa maite zuen itxura zinematografikoa sortu zuen. Eskerrik asko Hugok ez du Jeunet/Lurhmann-en ereduari jarraitzen eta "bere barregarritasunaren zentzu bat". fantasiak kontziente zaren heinean, ez zenuke esan nahi ikusleen artean jolasten ari dela zuzen eta haserre dagoela? Hugo gozo aurkitu ahal izango duzu, baina ez dut uste bere sentimenduaren benetakotasuna ukatua dela.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Tasha: Bai, hain zuzen ere, Hugo liluratuta sentitu dut. (Kontuan izan naiz zure galderari erantzuten ari zaidana, eta oso lanpeturik nengoen neuregana hurbiltzeko, nahiz eta nik uste dut erantzun hori bere eskubideetan dagoela. Ados, “eragina” gerta daiteke kasuaren gainjartzea. Estilo bisuala oso ezaguna esan nahi dut. Hala ere, pertsonalki hau ekarri zenuenean, agian, ez dago beste pertsona batzuen ikusizko inspirazioaren aurka, ezta horiekiko immunitatea ere.) Lehenbizi, Georges Mélièsen ipuingintzan aritu nintzen, zinemarekiko zaletasunarekin, bere artearekin eta atera zuen pozarekin. Edertasun eta dibertsioa dago Melièsen "Fairyland" itsaspeko eszenaren eszenatokian, eta amaieran, Méliès oinez. lagunduko dizut Hugok Méliès-ekin duen harremana ukitu polita izatea, eta zinemari buruzko film on bat gozatzen dut.<br/><br/>Baina Hugo ez da funtsean zinemari buruz, nahiz eta Méliès lotu-en inguruan, aipatu duzun gaiez gain, zure helburua ere aurkitzea da, pertsonaiak berariaz azaldu bezala, elkarren artean eta guri buruzko azalpen gisa. Eta ikuskizunez, ekintza-serie handiez, eta behin betiko amaieraz, haserre-aldiaz eta bikote dotoreaz gain, amaierak maitasun handiz bereizten ditu. Hermione Granger motako buruzagia eta grisa da, eta liburuetan baztertutako mundu magikoak goraipatzen ditu. Negozio hau guztia barregarri eta boteretsuena da.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Bai, badira arketipoekin jolasten ere, problema da, ez nuen inoiz imajinatuko zerbait berri, fresko edo sinestez, bere aurrekari propioa izan arren. Asko nahiago nuke eskorbuto gazte bati buruzko ipuin bat izatea, eskala txikikoa eta benetakoa dena, CGI erlojupeko eta urre koloreko hauts-motz beteriko gela zabalik eta amets profetikoak eta urrez tirante-zainda bat, guzti hori baino punta-puntako zentzugabekeria dena. Oraindik ere, zure filmeko gai pertsonala da, eta uste dut benetan sentitzen duela pantailan, baina ez dut horren ukitu pertsonala sentitzen, filmari buruzko uneak izan ezik. Baliteke oinarrizko emozioak egiazkoa izatea, baina horrek ez du exekuzioak gutxiago egiten.<br/><br/>Esaten duzu emozioa benetakotasuna ez dela ukatu behar. Ez dut uste futbola pertsonalki ume bat bezala bakarti eta isolatua sentitu den ala ez, baina ez dut bakardadea eta isolamendua sentitzen naiz pantailan. Apurtutako munstro kopuru bat ikusten dut (Hugo sua da eta bere arropa zizelak eta helduak berak hanka egiten du) eta katu handiak, negar egiten eta dolu egiten du. Nire ustez, zintzotasuna gero eta errukiagoa da, eta pertsonalagoa, norbaitek bere iritzia eskatzen didanean, benetan haserre dagoela onartzen dut, edo besterik gabe, nire zentzumenak menderatu nahian, neure iritzia adierazteko. Hugo denbora askoan oihu bat izan zen, nik izan nuen bezala.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Zergatik ez nuen eraman horrelako faltsua, Amerika, zeuk galdetzen duzu? Egia esan, egin nuen. Erabat aitortuko dut Amemlie eta Moulin Rouge-k zain berean eraikuntza handiak, manipulatzaileak, artifizialak direla, emozio zehatzak eskatzen dituztela tarte zehatzetan, eta emozio horiek soinu-ekoizpen lazgarri eta agresiboekin saltzen saiatuz. Niri ere ez zidaten saldu benetako giza sentimendu gisa. Hain zuzen ere, bi pelikula horietan gozatu nuena izan zen obra: bereziki, Amemlieren burutza, ausazko zerrenda ederrak, bere gaztelurako ezaugarriak eta esperientziak karakterizatuz, eta Moulin Rouge-ren musikal-magpie- eta kontestualizazioak. Askotan, egiturarekin gauza sortzaile edo handinahiak egiten dituzten istorioak saltzen ditut, eta film horiek, biak, Hugo askoz ere linealagoa da, haur-eskri estandaragoa.<br/><br/>Baina azkenean, niretzat, benetan agurtzen da film horiek onak direla, baina Hugok kontu handiz hartu behar du. Ez duzu uste hori egia dela, baina aldi berean bere osotasuna defendatzen ari zara, erabat benetakoa, sendoa eta ni gaizki nagoela esateko, eta ez du esan nahi serioski hartzea. Nola bateratzen dituzu bi adierazpen horiek? Zer iradokitzen dizu filmak ez duela aurpegiko balioa hartu? Posible al da Benjamin Buttonen kasu bitxia besterik ez da, non mutilen erabilera asko aspertuta eta melodia, aldiz, mutil batek zure zinismoa zeharkatzen duela eta zure familia-sentimendua doalarik?<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Scott: Ez ziur esan nahi izan Esklabo ez dela serio hartu behar; filmaren maitasun larria adierazteko erabiltzen den ibilgailu lotsagarria baino ez dela. Esaten duzunean, "Baina Hugo ez da batez ere filmari buruz, nahiz eta Méliès Tie-ins" gogoratzen ari naiz. Emango dizut, Hugok oso ezagunak eta neketsuak diren osagai asko aurkitu ditzazun, eta ez dago ezer egin dezaket pertzepzio horren inguruan, zein beste zalantza. Batzuetan film batek xarma eta xarmagarria esan nahi du, eta ez da horietako batzuentzat; Hugo eta Amélie dut, baina azken hori uste dut, nahiko artifiziala den arren, erromantiko aurkitzeko bidea egiten digu. (Hori baino gehiago, esan, kontzentrazio mekaniko izugarri batzuk Saw jarraipen baterako egokiak dira).<br/><br/>Baina Hugo ez da nagusiki filmari buruz? Filmari buruz ari ez bada, inoiz ikusi dudan istoriorik eztabaidagarriena da. Hugo eta Méliès-en arteko harremana filmaren bihotza da, eta horren erdian Pucky Orphan eta Cristy Old Guy Gold-ekin lotzen da, baina ingeniaritza magiarako afinitatea, hain zuzen ere. Uste dut Crespok eta bere kolaboratzaileek zinemaren lehen egunetan ilusioak adierazteko modu bat aurkitu dutela, adin guztietarako eskuragarria den fantasiaren bidez. (mm.pie.)<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Benjamin Buttonen kasu bitxiari dagokionez, ez dut lotura handirik ikusten, ez dut Benjamin Buttonen defendatzaile gisa agertu nahi nire sinesgarritasuna kalte egiteko. (Normalean, nola daude gehigarriak G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Blu-ray?) Esan dizut lo-depide berri bat zegoela niregan Benjamin Buttonena, baina ezin dut imajinatu denbora bat lehenago zahartzearen premisak mugituko ez nauenean. Nola ezin duzu horren eragina izan?) Eta, gainera, ez dut ikusten nola geratzen den Benjamin Buttonek Hugo lotzen duen pelikula, hori baita ibilbide handiago bat zabaltzen duen istorio baten segmentu txiki bat.<br/><br/>Beraz, konbentzitu zaitut, ez, baina espero dut jakitea Hugo ez zela erabat oztopo izan zuretzat. Méliès zinemagilearen sekuentziak Hugo baino gehiago dira, eta horretan, gutxienez, zinema maite ahal izango dugu.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Tasha: Ez, ezin dut esan konbentzitu nauzula, edozein dela ere konbentzitu dudan. Ezinezkoa da edonoren ikusmen maitasunari buruz hitz egitea, eta benetan posible izan behar da norbait ahotsetik bereiztea. Batez ere, Hugok Scott-O-Vision ikusten utzi dit, esperientzia interesgarria baita; behintzat, uste dut ez genuela nolabait lortu izen eta zuzendari bera izan zuten film desberdinak ikustea.<br/><br/>Zalantzarik gabe, hainbat esperientzia izan genituen, eta nire buruan, ekoizpenaren hainbat alderditan zentraturik: oraindik ez dut ikusten filma zoragarria dela, filmaren hari bakar gisa, beste askoren artean. Ia «Pointless diskurtsiboa» ia estaltzen du, baina "askoki polita eta preziatua" botako nuke horren gainean. Filmaren paper zaporetsuaren betegarriari begira zauden bitartean, uste dut pastel hori azukre kristalizatuarekin estaltzen zela, eta uste dut diferentzia bat egiten duela, filmaren oinarrizko mezua edo eszena tertzimetrikoa edozein dela ere. Ikusten duzu ere Benjamin Button, ez nuena soilik iraintzeko. Benetan uste dut zineman haurren artean egiten dudan apustu sentimental gehiago dituzula, batez ere giza pertsonaia gisa baino ahultasun eta errugabetasun sinbolo gehiago erabiltzen direnean. Aizu, badakizu filmak guztiz ez duela begi hutsezko moketak izaten mundu zikliko bati itxaropena ematen?G. Joe: Cobraren igoera. Beharbada Blu-ray gehigarri horiek ikusiko ditut, Hugoren gozotasuna konpentsatzeko leherketa-silla batzuk erabil ditzaket. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | «Gutxien nuen nire alaba une zail eta txarretatik aske izango zela»: «Me Me's istorioa errefuxiatu gisa<br/><br/>▪ Krisiaren garaian itxaropen: Amaren Eguna<br/><br/>Judith Santiagoren eskutik*<br/><br/>Mea-k entzun zidan soldaduak etortzen zirela.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Konbinazioak<br/><br/>Konbinazioak puntero baten aurka daude, koreografia-erantzunak, borroka-arteen izen asko dituzte, baina (nire esperientzietan) arte guztiek bertsio bat dute. Horrek forma desberdinak ditu, formarik ez duten arte martzial ugari daudelako. Zer egiten du bazkide gisa hain unibertsala? Zergatik erantzun espezifiko bat landu (errealitatean) denbora, eraso mota, erasotzailearen tamaina eta beste ehun faktore batzuek erantzun koreografiko osoa inoiz erabili ez izateko? Eta, azkenik, nola egin dezakegu benetako defentsa egoera batean eta aldi berean lesioa ekidin?<br/><br/>Konbinazioen unibertsaltasuna ikusgarriak da, gutxien esateko. Gure Knpo karate estiloak 108 konbinazio zerrenda du ikasi ahal izateko. (ikasle gehienek 20-30 baino ez dute ikasten) Brasil Jiu-Jastitsu-n, klase osoak armak eta masailak praktikatzen, zure bikoteari egokitzen zaion bitartean, pixkanaka erresistentziarik ez izateko aukera ematen du. boxer bakoitzak ordu igaro ditu poltsaren aurrean eta/edo ispiluaren aurrean punches konbinazio bera botatzen bere gorputza bakarrik mugitzen den arte. Konbinazioak unibertsalak dira, ez baitugu mugimendurik sartzeko modurik eta, ondoren, lan egiteko behar diren posizio sotilak praktikatzeko. Jantzien bidez presio-puntu txiki bat sakatuz, kontrol-barra bat harrapatu behar da arretaz kokatu eta konfigurazio zorrotz bat egin behar da, eta konbinazio handi bat bakarrik erabilgarria da posizio orekatu eta babestua zeharkatzen baduzu. Uste duzu trebetasun horiek lortzeko modu hobea dela?<br/><br/>Hainbat faktore zehazten dituzte eraso bati nola erantzuten dioten eta borroka batean edo borrokan ari ote den, inoiz ez dut nire defentsarako konbinazio osoa erabili. koreografia-erantzun horiek praktikan jartzen ditugu, helburua ez baita 8 konbinazio bat ikusten duzun bakoitzean, baina blokeatzeko modu bat erakutsiko dizugu, eta, ondoren, jarraitzeko aukera izango dugu. Ez dut inoiz aukeratu 3 egoera errealean, baina blokea nire go-to mugimenduak bat da. Konbinazioak gehitu tresna-kutxan, ez dute autoa konpondu.<br/><br/>Azken galdera segurtasunaren kontua da. Errealitatea errepikatzeko behar dugu. Nola saihestuko dugu hori egitea? Hori dela eta, konfiantza sortzea da. Gure bazkideengan konfiantza izaten hasten gara, eta gure bazkideengan konfiantza izaten ikasten dugu. Are gehiago, gure bazkidearekiko konfiantza izaten ikasten dugu eta pixka bat beldurgarria da, gure bazkideen kontrola guregan konfiantza izaten ikasten dugu. Azkenean (praktika asko) mugitu ahal izango duzu abiadura osoa, zure bikoteari botatzen eta lesioen beldurrik gabe bota.<br/><br/>Konbinazioak unibertsalak dira; praktikatzen dira, beraz, haien piezetan bana daitezke, eta seguru jarraitzen dugu konfiantza baxua eta eraikia. Arte martzialetan beste gauza guztiekin bezala, konbinazioek beren praktika eta exekuzioaren atzean arrazoi asko dituzte. |
