In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Lineako CPR ziurtagiria Bloga<br/><br/>Data: 2014ko uztailaren 23a<br/><br/>Ugaztunen inertzial handiko giltzurrunen gaixotasuna giltzurrunen funtzio ezagunetan eragiten duten gaixotasunen bilduma arraroa da.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobariak's vs. Locke-ren Naturaren egoerari buruzko kontakizuna<br/><br/>Gaia: Filosofia Hitzak: 2539 Orriak: 9 Abu 3, 2021<br/><br/>Hobariak eta Locke-k inoiz ingelesez idazten ari diren filosofo politiko garrantzitsuenen artean daude. Naturaren egoera gizarte konplexuen antolaketaren aurretik kokatzen da, eta ongizate eta blokeoak modu ezberdinetan interpretatzen dituen premisa da. Pertsona ohiak egoera naturalean ikusten ditu berdin arriskutsuak eta doakoak, justizia ez-jatorriko ez-egoerek mugatutako helburuak lortzeko; horregatik, “gizaki guztien aurka gerrari” esaten dio (Hobbes76). Bigarrenak, aldiz, jatorrizko egoeran gizakiak askatasun naturala mugatzen du besteenganako kalte-ordainak eskatzen ez dituen justiziaren ideiaren arabera, eta horrek aukera ematen du "elkarren laguntza eta zainketa" egoera definitzeko gerra baino (Locke 15). Estatu naturalaren bi filosoforen artean gertatzen den funtsezko desberdintasuna da Locke-ek biblia-baldintza etikoak erabiltzen dituela, eta, azken batean, Howard-ek gizakiekiko baimen mugagabea aurreikusten duela, gobernuari printzipio moralek mugatzen dioten bitartean.<br/><br/>Hobariak pertsona guztiek beren gaitasun fisiko eta psikikoetan gutxi-berdinak diren naturari buruzko hipotesiak ezartzen ditu. Pertsona batzuek indar fisiko handiagoa edo goi-mailako adimena frogatu dezaketela onartzen du, baina "denek elkar hartzen dutenean, gizakiaren eta gizakiaren arteko aldea ez da hain handia". (Hobbs 74). Gizakiek beren gaitasunetan gutxi gora-behera dutenez, antzeko itxaropena dute beren helburuak lortzeko eta haien beharrak asetzeko (Hobbak 75). Berdintasunaren emaitza logikoa denez, jendeak baliabide urrien aldeko apustua egiten hasten denean, inork ezingo du bere ondasunetan guztiz seguru sentitu. Nahiz eta pertsona boteretsu, maltzur eta gai izan "guztien guztiok egin dezake" epaian lortzen badu ere, ez du segurtasunik bermatzen (Hobbes 75). Gizakiek ez duten bezala, nagusitasun horrek bere adimenarekiko duen indarrari kalte egiten dion besteengan, inork ezin du guztiz ziur sentitu bere berdinak direnean. Mundua[aldatu &#124; aldatu iturburu kodea] Estatu naturalean gertatzen den berdintasuna beldurra da, non gizaki guztiek elkar ikusten duten lehiakide arriskutsu gisa.<br/><br/>Hobariak bezala, Blokeoak gizaki guztiak berdinak direla uste du, baina terminoari esanahi oso desberdina ematen dio. Bere ikuspuntutik, ez da gaitasun-berdintasuna, baizik eta balio-berdintasuna. Jendeak "izaeraren abantaila berdinei esker" esan nahi du, horien artean berdintasuna ezin hobea izan behar duela, ez baitago inor benetan baliotsuagotzat jo behar duenik (Locke 8). Besteentzat goi-mailako pertsona batzuk izendatzeko fundazio bakarra honakoa izango litzateke: «Jainkoak bere borondatearen adierazpenik egin, bata bestearen gainetik ezarri» (Locke 8). Gizateriaren ordezkari guztien berdintasun naturala ez dela uste du Locke-k, hain zuzen ere, ez dago zalantzan jarri behar. Hobariak berdintasunera hurbiltzen dira, eta jendea bere Estatu naturalean berdin arriskutsua dela azpimarratzen dute, baina Locke-k ikuspegi etikoa erabiltzen du eta aditzera ematen du gizaki berdinak direla Jainkoaren begietan. Desadostasun hau, ordea, bi egileen arteko lehen ezberdintasuna da, Locke-k bere filosofia politikoan oinarrituko baitu bere burua, eta Hobbesek ez.<br/><br/>Web-orriko beste ezaugarrietako bat libertatearen interpretazioa da.Bebho-en arabera, naturaren egoerak askatasun mugagabea dakar norberaren existentziarako beharrezkoa den guztia egiteko. Filosofiak askatasuna definitzen du, norberaren helburuak lortzeko gaitasunak erabiliz (Hobes 79). Sentimendu bakoitzaren helburu nagusia bere existentziari eustea da. Ondorioz, biblia-askatasuna behar ez den zerbait egiteko aukerari zor zaio, bataren ustez, norberaren bizitza eta ondasunak (Hobes 79) gordetzeko egokiena izango litzatekeena. Libertatearen muga bakarra da pertsona batek ezin duela inolako kontraesanik egin bere bizitza mantentzeko edo "berak gordetzeko bitartekoak" suntsituz (Hobbes 79). Honetaz gain, ez dago mugarik, eta denek dute "guztien eskubidea, baita beste gorputz bati ere" gehiago bizirik irauten badu (Hobbs 80). Horrela, Bibliaren arabera, askatasuna naturala, kanpotik behartuta ez dauden oztopoak ez egotea da norberaren etengabeko existentzia bermatzeko eta iraunkorrerako eskubidea lortzeko.<br/><br/>Locke-ek, gainera, askatasun naturalaren ideiari eusten dio, baina, ustekabean, modu nabarmenean hurbiltzen da, biblia-segurutasunarena ez bezalakoa. Naturaren egoeran askatasuna eztabaidatzen hasten den unean, berehala adierazi zuen askatasun-estatu batek ez duela «lizentziaren egoera» (Locke 9) parekorik. Lehenengoa Bibliaren arabera gertatzen da: hala ere libre eta independientea, pertsona batek, ordea, "ez du bere burua suntsitzeko askatasunik" (Loke 9). Locke-ren arabera, gizaki guztiek betebeharra dute "bere bizitza, osasuna, askatasuna edo ondasunak kaltetzeko" (9). Berdintasunaren interpretazioari dagokionez, egileak arrazoi etikoak eta erlijiosoak ditu oinarri: pertsona bakoitzak bere existentzia gorde behar du, “onponte” beraren sorkuntzak baitira eta nahita jakintsuak (9. irudia). Horrela, Locke-ren mugak estatu naturalean gero eta zorrotzagoak dira Howard-ek bere burua eta beste batzuk kaltetzeko betebeharra urratuz.<br/><br/>Bi egileen arteko desberdintasunak ere agertzen dira, gizatasunaren egoera naturalean.Bablesari dagokionez, praktika justu eta bidegabeak delineatuz, legearen kontua baino ez da gertatzen. Ez dago inolako jurisprudentziarik naturan, eta gizakiok bere jatorrizko egoeran dagoen lege bakarra segurtasun pertsonala bilatzea baino ez du behartzen. Ondorioz, ez da ezer injustiziarik izan gizakiaren jatorrizko egoeran: "zuzentasun eta injustizia okerren nozioak" ez dute inolako lekurik eta ez dute esanahirik hartzen indarrean dagoen legerik ezean (Hobbs 78). Jendeak bere askatasun ia mugagabea erabiltzen duen bitartean baliabideekin bat datorren askatasunean, berdin-berdinak baitira, ez dute inolako irizpiderik ekintza justu eta bidegabeen artean bereizteko. Hori dela eta, biblia-estatuak justizia-estatua defendatzen du, egileak lege formalaren eta ezarritakoaren funtzio soil gisa interpretatzen baitu.<br/><br/>Locke-k esanahi desberdina esleitzen dio justiziari, eta ez du hainbeste legeri erreparatzen baldintza etikoetan. Artikulu honek, Hobariak ez bezala, ideia etikoak erabiltzen ditu eta, oro har, bere filosofia moralean oinarritzen du, prepuzio praktiko hutsak baino. Locke-ren lege naturala, Hobbes-ek ez bezala, gizaki guztiak bere burua defendatzeko baino ez dira zaintzen. Ondorioz, justiziarako eta injustiziarako leku bat dago bere izaeraren egoeran. Egileak berak adierazten du hori, inork ez duela kendu behar bere bizitzaren beste bat, “justizia delitu batean egitea” izan ezik (Loce 9). Adierazpen honek argi erakusten du, Locke-ren arabera, naturako justizia dago, eta, gainera, gizakiak aktiboki gorde behar duela. Kontzientziaren irizpidea, zein estatu naturalak ez duen bigarren muga naturala, Locke-k inposatutako askatasun naturalarekiko: ekintza bat bidegabea bada, beste pertsona baten bizitzarako eta ondasunetarako bermerik ez badago.<br/><br/>Desberdintasun horiek bi autoreen berdintasun-, askatasun- eta justizia-harremanetan edo gerra-estatuaren eta gerra-estatuaren arteko harremanean oinarritzen dira. Hobberen ikuspegitik, biak sinonimoak dira, txapelketa zorigaiztokoa delako, gaitasun baliokideak eta antzeko beharrak dituzten pertsonen emaitza logiko bakarra da baliabide mugatuak dituen ingurunean. Hark adierazten du konexio hori: "bi gizonek gauza bera nahi badute, nahiz eta ezin izan, etsai bihurtu" eta, beraz, elkar gerra egoeran daude (Hobes 75). Hala ere, gizakiok gaitasun eta behar berberak dituenez, lehia hori ez da soilik interakzio indibidualetan, baizik eta giza mailan ere bai. Gizaki guztiek baliabide guztien eta besteen gorputz eta bizitzaren eskubide berdin eta mugagabea izaten duten bitartean, naturaren egoera "gizaki guztien aurka" gerra da (Hobbes 76). Neska-interpretazio hori zuzenean Hobariaren egoeratik eratortzen da, pertsona bakoitzaren premia egotistak soilik gobernatzen baitituzte.<br/><br/>Blokeoa, bestalde, izaeraren eta gerra-estatuaren artean bereizten da, eta aldi berean gerta daitezken bitartean, ez da beste batekin identifikatzeko arrazoirik. Locke-en gerraren definizioa ia berdina da Hobari-ek eskainitakoa. Locke-ren arabera, "bere botere absolutuan beste gizon bat lortzeko saiakerak bere burua berarekin" (14). Azalpen honek ezin hobeto erantzuten du gizaki guztiek, besteen gorputz eta bizitzak barne, gerraren egoerara iristeko duten eskubidearen ideia. Hala ere, Locke-k uko egiten dio gerraren egoera eta naturaren egoera ekitatiboari, zehazki, Howard-en askatasun naturalaren interpretazioa ukatzen duelako. Locke-ren egoera naturaletik jendea bere buruaz beste egitea eragozten da, askatasunean beste pertsona baten askatasuna urratzea baita lege naturalaren aurka. Hobarientzat, gerra gizateriaren egoera da berez, eta Locke-k natura-estatuaren perbertsio gisa irudikatzen du bere araua baino.<br/><br/>Desberdintasun horiek, hala nola, askatasuna, berdintasuna, justizia eta gerra, egileei gobernuak kontrajartzeko modua ematen diete. Naturaren egoeraren ebaluazio positiboan oinarrituta, Leviathanek gerraren baldintzetan, ez dago itxaropena "izaerak gizonei bizitzeko ematen dien denboragatik" (Hobbes 80). Soluzioa eskubide unibertsala ezartzen ari da guztientzat eta "beste gizonen aurkako askatasun handia" izaten ari da (Hobes 80). Ondoriozko gizarte kontratuko parte-hartzaileek subiranotasun mugagabea inbertitzen dute, lortutako egoera-kupoa bere aurka zigortuta mantentzeko helburu duen botere gorenaren eramailea. subiranoaren boterea absolutua da: agintariak "behar lukeena egiteko" ahalmena du bere subjektuen arteko bakea sustatzeko, inork ez dezan inoren bizitza edo jabetza asaltuko (2013). Hobariek ondorioztatzen dute subjektuei edozer egiteko eskubidea duen irudi bidegabea, ez dagoela bakerik eta ez segurtasunik.<br/><br/>Locke-ek gizarte antolatuak sortzeko beharrarekin bat egiten duen arren, ez zuen zalantzan jartzen Howard-en botere subiranoaren ideia mugagabea eta ezegonkorra. Lehen esan bezala, Locke-ren izaera ia ez da zoritxarrekoa, zeren jendeak bere burua ez ezik, elkar ere gordetzeko betebeharra duelako. Hori dela eta, kontratu sozialaren beharra ez da besteen beldurragatik sortzen, baizik eta sheer erosotasunetik. Komunitate txikiek ez dute legerik behar gatazkak konpontzeko eta "prozesuen gainbegiratzea", baina elkarte handiagoek erakunde-gobernuei gomendatzen diete (Locke 57). Hala ere, ezin da gobernuaren boterea mugagabea izan, gaia beste gizon baten borondate ez-koherente, zalantzagabea, arbitrarioa izango litzatekeelako 17. Bere bizitzan beste pertsona baten botere absolutuarekin ados, subjektu batek bere buruari kalte egiteko debekua urratuko luke. Agintariari dagokionez, beste pertsona baten libertatea suntsituz gero, kalte zuzenak izango lirateke eta, beraz, bigarren mugaren aurkakoa izango da.<br/><br/>Gobernu mugagabearen kasuaren jarraipen zuzen gisa, Howard-ek botereak printzipio gisa bereiztea ukatzen du. Ikuspegitik, subiranotasunak, behin instituzioa, "arauen ordena ezartzeko ahalmen osoa" du, subjektuen bizitza gobernatzeko, edo, termino legegileak (Hobes 114) agintzeko ahalmena. Subiranoak, era berean, “entzumena eta erabakitze guztia” izateko eskubidea gordetzen du, hau da, botere judiziala (Hobbes 114). Azkenik, subiranoaren helburu osoa materiak elkarri kalterik egin ez diezaioten behar denez, ez dago zalantzarik botere betearazlea bera ere badela. Ahalmenen banaketa, kontzeptu gisa, Hobariaren antzekoa da, naturaren egoerari buruzko ikuspegiengatik. Erakunde politiko bat sortzea, non adar exekutiboak, legegileak eta epaileek elkar ikusiko zuten, hau da, lehiatzeko, modu horretan natura-ez gerrako egoera berrezarriko litzateke maila altuago batean. Pertsonak kontratu soziala eta institutua sartzen dira haien atzean natura jartzeko, ez modu desberdinean, botereak modu zuzenean banantzeko.<br/><br/>Locke-k, bestalde, botere banaketa bere teoria politikoaren oinarrizko printzipio gisa hartzen du, bere banaketak argi eta garbi erakusten baitu botere legegilearen mugen inguruan. Locke-k jarri zuen bezala, zaila izango litzateke "pertsona berberentzat, legeak egiteko boterea dutenek ere izatea". (76) Filosofiak giza izaeraren inperfekzioetara eta "potentzian" sartzeko berezko nahia seinalatzen du, neurri kautela horretarako arrazional gisa (Locke 76). Hobberen kasuan bezala, Locke-k boterea banatzearen kontakizunean, naturaren interpretaziotik eratortzen da zuzenean. Naturaren egoeran justizia badago eta jendeak uler dezake, ezinbestean edozein gobernuk lege natural beraren menpe dagoela. Erabateko botereak lege honen mugak urratzen dituenez, bereizketa eta banatzea komenigarria da gobernuak behar bezala funtziona dezan.<br/><br/>Artikulu honek frogatu du gizateriaren egoera naturalaren arteko desberdintasunak ugari direla, baina azken batean lokal moralen presentziaren zenbatekoa dute. Hobariak egoera naturala ikusten du askatasun mugagabetik, non pertsona bakoitzak gaitasun berdinak ditu eta ez du inolako nozio moralik sortzen, hala nola justiziarik, baliabideentzat lehian daude. Blokeoa, ordea, berdintasuna eta askatasuna interpretatzen ditu, nahiz eta ia gerra naturala izan, legeak gizaki naturalak elkar ez kaltetzeko betebeharra baitu. Desadostasun horrek filosofoak gobernura eramaten ditu, eta bere burua gobernari oro har ezartzen dio, zoritxarreko etikorik ezean, beste agintari batek ezin baitu behartu gizakiak elkar ez kaltetzeko. Hala ere, Locke-ren iritziz, gobernu-botere mugagabea natura-legean sartuta zeuden muga etikoekin kontraesankorrak izango lirateke, horregatik, zorrak ez bezala, botereak bereiztea defendatzen du. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Modako Polizia: Zer sortu zen Tronuaren jokoa<br/><br/>Abbas Hasan abeslari kanandar-frantziarrak ahalegin handia egin zuen gizateriaren alde Modako Parade-n 2014an, ezer txarrik gabe, segurtasuna lehentasuna da eta musika osasun-arriskua da hemen.<br/><br/>Eta izar bat izan nahi dugu.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....
