| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 azaroa 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa mundu osoko eskualde subtropikal eta tropikal mariskoetan hazten den landare nagusia da.Doxorolen osagai nagusia da, funtzio kognitiboa areagotzen duen nutrizio-osagarria.

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Amaren ahotsa zen, bere alaba galduaren atsekabean bihurriturik. Ondoren, Katomeok arrastorik gabe bota zuen, eta oso gogoratu zituen une horiek, hasteko modua, gosaltzekoa zer zen eta bere amari esan zion azken gauza. Izugarria izan zen, oroitzapen horiek, beste garai batean bezala, munduari barre egiten zielako. Berak esnatu egin zuen, galdu gabe, ez baitzuen lan bat aurkitu, eta egun horretan elkarrizketa bat egiteko prest zegoen. Bere bihotza ez zen egon bertan, baina zer egin behar zuen.<br/><br/>Gogoratzen zuen beldurtzearen sentsazioa, hura xurgatuz eta bere buruari hitzaldi bat emanez, hori egin zezakeen. Bizitzan aurrera egin zezakeen, iraganean gauzak finkatu behar zituelako. Noski, sentimenduak zituen, jada bere denboran edo bere bizitzan jabe ez zela sentitzen, atzean utzi zuen guztia ez baitzuen.<br/><br/>Kagomeak gogoratzen zuen egurraren sentsazioa bere hatzen azpian, eskua estutu egiten zuela eskuarekin atea irekiz. Gogoratzen zuen bere burua irribarre distiratsu eta bizi batekin bere gain hartzen zuen bitartean. Gogoratzen zuen bere ahotsa nola indartsua zen, amako ezpainetan irribarrea harro dagoela. Amak bere agurraren txartzat jotzen zuen, eta horrek ez zuen alderik ikusten, baina nolabait, kagomenean, ezabatutako hitzen pisuak are gehiago islatzen zuen.<br/><br/>Handik gutxira, pentsamenduek barre egiten zuten, bere amari kezkatu eta, hala ere, nahi izan ez bazuen, bere amaren indarra, bere alabak hainbeste denboran zehar alde egin zuela aitortu ahal izango zuen. Bazen batzuetan bere burua ahula zela emakumea ez izatea uste zuenean.<br/><br/>Hala ere, gogoan izan behar zuela nahaspila-kopuru bat, airean egon zitekeen aldaketa, batez ere espero zuena baino desberdina, bat-batekoa eta ezohikoa. Ez zen bere etxeko santutegia izan, eta atzera egin zuenean, bera joan zen ateetatik irristatzera, bere mandoen azpian metal ezezagun eta hotz batekin topo egin zuen, eta ez zen bere etxearen sarrera. Gizon bat bere aurrean zutik zegoen, kontraeraso baten atzean, begiekin hasi zena bere kabuz.<br/><br/>Ez zuen izurik izan, denbora pasa ahala, eta ezinezkoak diren egoeretan jarri zen boterea, gertatu ahala. Izan ere, ez zen egunero aurkitzen norbaitek demonio baten arabera arrastatzen ari zela, haren gorputzetik kanpo bitxiak sortzen saiatu ziren, ez baitzuten ezagutzen. Eta orduan, bazegoen bitxi boteretsu hura, nork dakiten eta haiek bilatzen zituen. Hala ere, gauza horiek ez ziren normalak, eta estutu behar izan zuen, eta zitzaizkionean bere errealitatea zela konturatu zen. Hain erraza zen, tiradak bildu eta harribitxia konpondu besterik ez.<br/><br/>Baina ez zen erraza izan, hainbat deabru egon ziren tiradaren eta harribitxiaren atzetik. Eta bereziki deabru boteretsu bat, bete nahi zuena. Gaur egun ez zuen inoiz jakin nahi, baina ez zen inoiz eman ezta eman ere eztanda egin ondoren. Bizi asko hondatu zuen ezergatik. Berrogeita hamar urte bete ziren. Narak bere lagunik gabe joan zen guztiaren lekuko izan zen, eta hori izan zen bere lagunik gabekoena.<br/><br/>Baina ezustekoa izan zen, gertatzen ari zenarekin eta bere abenturatik lortutako borondatearekin topo egitea gogoratu zuen, umoretsuegia edo urruna diruditen istorio batekin topo egiten hasi zela. Hura sinetsi behar zuen, bizirik iraun behar zuen.<br/><br/>Ondoren, kamera denda batean baino okerrago jokatu zuen, eta bere hortzen bidez bere bizitza aurrez salbatzeko gezurra esan zuen.<br/><br/>Azken finean, ez zen gezur oso bat izan, eta elkarrizketa batean parte hartzeko bere etxetik atera zen, gutxienez bere soineko egoera horren lekuko izan baitzen, hark esan zuena.<br/><br/>Eta arrazoiren batengatik gizon zoro hori kontratatu zuen.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Koomedek, bere ohean, urruneko oroitzapenak bultzatu zituenean, benetan esnatu zela aitortu zuen, eta azkenik loaren azken begiradak suntsitu zituen, itzultzeari eta bere besarkada egiteari ekin zion. Begiak itxi zituen, lo egiteko prest, eta oroitzapenen distantzian bakarrik ezagutu zuen kantu baten oihartzunak, askotan tormentatzen zion abesti bat, izen bera emanda. Bekatua ez zen gehiago bere ama gogoratzen, baizik eta hazi ahala jokatu ohi zuten haurren ahotsak. Gogoratzen zituzten, nahiz eta urte batzuk izan bizitza hau hasi zenetik, nahiz eta zoriontsu izan zen bizitza honetan, oroitzapenen deia oso ozen zen.<br/><br/>Bat-batean, atzera erori eta lo egin zuen berriro, eta bere burua ikusten zuen bere familiaren besarkadan Inuyasha joan zen bitartean, sentitzen zuen moduan. Une hartako oroitzapenak, sentimendu horiek hain indartsuak ziren, bihotz-bihotzez eta atsekabez bizi izan ziren berriro, nahiz eta oso denbora gutxi sentitu zuen, kendua izan zen batere.<br/><br/>Noski, bere familia madarikatua izan zen eta zoriontsu izan zen bere besoetan duela berriro, ezin zuen inoiz erabat deskribatu nola sentitu zuen egun horietan. Hala ere, ezin izan zuen azaldu nola sentitzen zen modu bitan, bere iraganean eta gaur egun izateko desioak zituela. Gogoan izan behar zuela zulotik salto egiten, hatzak lurrean erortzen ari zirela bere itzulerari uzteko. Lehenengo hilabetea, ez zuen lo asko, berak negar egiten zuen bitartean.<br/><br/>Elisiok antzeko erreakzioa lortu zuen, nahiz eta ez zen hain gogorra izan, ez baitzekiten zehatz-mehatz non lo egin zuen eta ez zuen jakin non negar egiten zuen. Bere esplorazioak sotilak izan ziren bere lana lan egiteko eta bizitza horretan bere burua kokatzeko. Ez zuen geratzeko asmorik, ez baitzen behar baino luzeagoak izateko. Eta ez zuen saiatu hain sutsuki iraganean itzuli zenean bezala, bere pasioa mundu honekin loturarik ez zuelako, benetan bakarrik baitzegoen... Noraino iristen zen.<br/><br/>Bere une irratian, uste zuen Jewel-ek atzera bota zuela eta infernua aurkitu zuen bertan egoteko. Infernu berri bat nahi zuen, baina argi eta garbi gogoratzen zuen betiko joan nahi zuela. Honek ez zituen bere ametsak gelditu, gauean esnatu eta bere iraganaren oroitzapenik gogorrenak ziren, ahaztu beharreko gogorrenak. Bere bihotza, berriz ere oheratu zuen izuturik, bere arnasa borroka bihurtu zen, bere adimena gauez esnatzen ari zitzaion izuaren aurka borrokatzen zuen bitartean.<br/><br/>Hain ahula sentitzen zuen, beraz, beldurra.<br/><br/>籠の中�の饥は<br/><br/>Kagomeek azkenean ohetik bota zuen bere logela, argi zuri-gorria, bainuari gidatzeko nahikoa zuen, ispiluaren aurretik zutik, bere gogoetara jo zuen bitartean. Ravena koloreko ileak aurpegia estaltzen zuen eta txarra zela sentitu zuen, eta Elytionen lehenengo goizean horrela zegoen, bera baino ez zegoen okerrago.<br/><br/>Lo egiteko leku bat aurkitu zuen, eraikinaren jabearekin lan egiteko kudeaketak denbora pixka bat ordaindu gabe. Beharbada, Miroku-en eragina izan zuen halako akordioetan aritzeari esker, tximinoa ezaguna zelako jendeak egin zuen lanarengatik nahikoa baino gehiago emateko. Gizakia beti izan zen bidea, lehenengo jendeak ezagutu zuenetik, berak esango zuela ohorea izatea, ez zela egongo, edo, esan zion eraso bat egongo zela, bere hitzak eta xarmak salduko zituela, prezio altuetarako. ia beti lan egin zuen eta galdetu zuen zergatik jendeak hain prest zegoen berarengana fio izateko.<br/><br/>Agian bere irribarrea izan zen, edo iraganeko jendea hain umilduko zela uste zuen, ez zuen inoiz negarrik egin, gutxienez. Beti egin zuen arrazoia eta indarraren sinboloa zen bere garaian, dena zuzen egiteko bultzatu zuenean. Hiltzen ari zela bultzatu zuen, madarikatua izan zen eta zerbait egiten saiatu zen bere patuari uko egiten, baina denbora mugara igo zen azken borrokara. Eta pozik zegoen Naraku garaituak izan zirela bere aita eta aita bera bezalako patuarekin bihurtu ahal izan aurretik.<br/><br/>Bere xarmari dagokionez, hala ere, bere laguna baino askoz zuzenagoa zen eta akordioaren arrazoizkoa egin zuen. Zalantzarik gabe, mundu honetako edonork prezio kaltegarria ordainduko zuela exorzismo edo deabruengatik, teknologikoki aurreratuta zeuden. Baina nahiko aurreratua zen, eta nahiko adimentsua, akordio on bat egiteko.<br/><br/>Baina orain, Kagome toki hobean zegoen, bere aurpegia begiratzen zuen arren. Haued, nekatuta, drainatua...<br/><br/>Horman erloju batean begirada azkar bat eman zion loa luzatu ahal izateko. Baina hori alde batera utzi zuen, ez zuen berriz aurre egin nahi. Horren ordez dutxa bat hartu zuen, ur hotza erabiliz bere deabruak botatzeko, bere birikak betez arnasa hartuz eta bere burua esnatuz.<br/><br/>いついガガる<br/><br/>Ez zuen funtzionatu.<br/><br/>Ur hotza bere biriketan behar zuen, eta horrek ito eta muskuluak asaldatu zituen. Barre pixka bat bota zuten bere ezpainetatik, burua okertu eta gehiago aurkitu zuen. Gaur egun, ez zituen hain erraz ihes egingo; ez zuen hain erraza izango, berreskuratzea besterik ez baitzuen egin nahi.<br/><br/>Batzuetan, ez dago zuk nahi dituzun pentsamenduak saihesten, nahiz eta zuk ziur egon horiek aurretik.<br/><br/>Senarra bere lagunik onena zen, nahiz eta inoiz izan ez zuen arreba deitu, arreba zaharragoa zena, beti izan zuen bere aldea arazoak sortzen dituenean. Bereziki, mutilen arazoak, gauza horiek hutsalak direnean, baina dibertigarria izan zen bere izenean egin ahal izateko Inuyasha bere burua triste egin zuenean. Azken finean, askotan izan zen erdi deabruak bere hildako maitalearen alde korrika eta bere bihotza behin baino gehiagotan hautsiko zuela.<br/><br/>Baina, Sangoek, gainera, beste era batera iradoki zion: emakume guztiak hain indartsuak izan ziren, ziur... nahiz eta berak zalantzatu zuen garaian ere, beti igaro zen. Familia osoa galdu ondoren bizirik irauteko gaitasuna zuela miresten zuen - hau gogoratzen zuen askotan, mundu guztiari galdu ziolako- eta, ondoren, bere anaia Narakuren peoi bat bihurtu zelako. Ez zen erraza izan, ezin izan zen izan inork aurre egin eta oraindik ere aurrera joan. Oraindik irribarre egin zuen, baita mina horrekin eta oroitzapenekin... askotan hain argitsua zen, baita garai ilunetan ere.<br/><br/>Eta orain, emakume zaharraren aldean sartu nahi izan zuen, han egon zen eroso eta lagundu ziolako. Berak sentitzen zuen Santiagok nolabait hori egingo zuela, eta indarra eta ulermen hitz batzuk eskainiko zituela. Garai horietan bezala, sorgin hauek okerrera egin zuten, bere familiarik gabe zegoela gogorarazten zuen konstanteak.<br/><br/>«Ez dut nahi bakarrik egon nahi», oihu egin zuen bere arimagatik, dutxaren soinua ihesa itotzen.<br/><br/>Ez zuen beldur izan hura onartzeko.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Beste ordu batean, ohartu baino lehen, bere azala uretatik hotza zenez eta bere zainetatik izotz-arrastu bezala sentitu zen. Ez zuen konturatu bere burua uretara bueltatu arte eta dutxa amaitu arte. Kagomeek ez zuen ispiluan bere begirada propioa bilatu berriro, aitzitik, eskuoihaletan bere burua bildu zuen eta komunetik fidatu zen, eskailerak igo eta sukaldera. Gosari arina egiten hasi zen, janaria prestatzen zuen egunaren oharren bidez atseginez irakurtzean.<br/><br/>Bere ibilbide profesionala azken urteotan izan zen ikusgai, galeria askotan agertu zen bere izena, argazkigintzan interesa zutenen ezpain asko erabiltzen hasi zen.<br/><br/>Lan hark galdetu zion oso zorte handiagoa izan zuela mundu honetan egotea espero zuena baino, inoiz ez zuen zorterik izan bere mundurako arraildura, baina zorte handia merezi du. Sutara itzuli zenean, azkenean etxera itzultzeari eman zion denbora gogoratzen zuen. Bi urte geroago, bere bizitza hemen izan zuen, argazkilaritzan hasi zen afizioa baino zerbait gehiago bezala, baina bere buruari izen bat eman zion.<br/><br/>Egun hori bereziki atsegina izan zen, eguzkia zeruan altua zen eta bere burua aurkitu zuen paisaia naturalaren argazki batzuk hartuz. Landareetako batean ezkutatuta zegoen mutiko txiki bat, eta bere aurpegiaren irudi bat jaso zuen, gorri alaia, txikiegia, bere harrapakinari hasiera emateko unera iritsi aurretik. Hala ere, lehen ezagutu zutenean familiatik ihes egin behar izan zuen, baina aita hil egin zen eta ezeztatu egin zioten. Gazteak, hain heldua dirudi bere lehen bileretan.<br/><br/>Agian Inuyasharen eragina izan zen, kita berriro umea bezala jardutea ahalbidetu zuena, gaztea eta zirraragarria izan dadin beste batzuetan helduago zegoen bitartean. Bere ibilbide propioan erosotasuna eskaini zion, eta bere ardura zaintzen saiatu zen, gerora gaztea izango bazen ere. Hala ere, bere gazteak ez zuen utzi ulertzen nola bere semea bezalako zaintzeko. Bere bihotzak irribarre egin zuenean, hain pozik zegoen karrasken opariengatik eta artea egiteko denbora hartu zuenean, hain harro zegoen berak zeukan marrazki bakoitzarekin, bazekiela hau zela zein ama izango zen egoera horretan.<br/><br/>Berak huts egin zuen, gehiegi baitzitzaude, eta ikusi nahi izan zuen zenbat hazi zen joan zen, ez baitzuen asko galdu...<br/><br/>Bere burua beste edozein min askatzeko, esperantza faltsuak... Eman zion, eta bere burua hobetzera bideratu zuen.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Gosariak txigortua, aspergarria eta inspirazioa galdu zuen. Behin bakarrik konturatu zen edozer espezieri edo zaporeri ahaztu ziola elikagaiengatik. Izan ere, gaur egun askoz ere gehiago gogoratzen zuten, bere adimena beste bizitza batzuei buruz argi eta garbi bere janaria baino garrantzitsuago bihurtu zen.<br/><br/>«Sit!».<br/><br/>Jakina, ezer ere ez zen izan, batez ere, erdia gogorarazten zion bezero zapuztu batean, bereziki buru-belarri ari zela, eta argazki bat nahi zuen modu naturalean lan egitea baino. animaliak basatiak nola nahi zuen jokatzeko ahaleginak egin ditzakezu. Baina, oso gutxitan arrakasta izan zuen inorekin. Inuyasha ez zen txarra izan, hala ere, jakin zuen beragandik ihes egin aurretik. Txikiago, ulergarriagoa, helduago bihurtu zen, nahiz eta oraindik ume eta oilar izan zen.<br/><br/>Gogoan izan nola bere masailak erre zituen, baina nola berak lurra erre eta sua egin zuen. Esan zion ezen nahi zuen inorekin lan egitea, ezta bere nahi zuena baino gehiago.<br/><br/>Berak Narakurakoarekin alderatu behar zuen, Inuyasha baino, baina bere bezeroak ez zuen horrelako asmorik izan, eta gero sentitu zuen oroimena atsegina zela. Orain arte gertatu omen zen jakitearen askatasuna, berak ez zuen nahi izan, besteengandik independentea zen pertsona izateko, une horretan egin zuen bezala. Arrastoak entzun arren, geroago hitzekin, bera difamatzea esan nahi zuen.<br/><br/>Bere burua zuzen defendatu zuen, bere bidaiaren amaieran egin zuen bezala. Azken finean, mundu honetan babestu ahal izan zuen bakarra izan zen.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Goizeko argia bere etxean sartzen hasi zen, denboraren joanean berriz gogora. Berriz, hasteko egin behar zituen gauzen zerrendatzat jo zuen, eta eztabaidatu zuen. Edo, azkenean hasi beharko balu ere. Eguna nola hasi zen, ez zekien ideia handi bat pentsatuko ote zuen, zalantzarik gabe, bere buruarekin nola galdu zen arrakasta izango zuela.<br/><br/>Ez zuen bere azken lana utzi nahi, eta aurretik zenbaitetan egin zuen hori. Ez zen atsegina izan hondamendi oso baten bila saiatzea eta berreskuratzea.<br/><br/>Kagomeek gogoratu zuen bere esperientzia zabala, marka berria, kamera eskuan zuela, ez zuela prestatu, bere poltsatik kendu berri baitzuen. Barruan garrasi egin zion. Umore dramatikoa, goitik behera, garrasia egiten zuen maiz, asko gazteagoa zen bitartean egin zuen. Erdi-mailako eskolaren bidez egiten ari zenean, garaien artean erosketak egiten ari zen bitartean. Beste zatia izoztu egin zen bere lentea erabat apurtu zen bitartean eta gainerako kamerarekin batera apurtu zen.<br/><br/>Inuyasharen anaia ikustea, deabrua oso bat, bere azkeneko gauza zela espero zuen bere argazkiak ateratzeko, inoiz bezain harro zegoela, gogoratu ahala. Ez zuen begiratu mundu guztiz ezberdin batean egotea, nahiz eta inoiz ez zuen bere burua irakurtzean onena izan. Bere izena hain indartsua zen, bere ezpainetan hain indartsua zen, bere sentimenduak gogoratu ahal izateko. Bere ezpainak xehatu ziren, bere ahoak lehor sentitu zuen, eta sabeleko nahigabeko sentsazioak gaixotu egin zion.<br/><br/>Ez zuen nahi itxaropenak igotzea.<br/><br/>Baina han egon nahi zuen, nahiz eta lagunak izan, aliatuak izan, zerbaiten alde borrokatu zuten, eta zerbait guztiz hoberik zen.<br/><br/>Eta Kagomeak zentzu nahikoa izan zuen berari ez botatzeko, besoen inguruan bildu zuen bere inguruan, jakinaren gainean ez zegoela bakarrik. Gogoratzen zuen ez zela beste ezer gairik berarekin igarotzen zen bitartean, ez munduarekin hitz egiten (edo, berak hitz egiten zuen eta, besterik gabe, egia hori aitortu zuen).<br/><br/>Noiz, zehazki, haren alde erori zen... Kagomea gauza sotila zen, baina sentimendua han zegoen, eta esan zion ez zela bakarrik erori, sentimenduek nolabait burla egiten zutela.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Pisuaren sentimendu batek bere gain hartu zuen, eta bat-batean begiak ireki zituen, adimena etengabe ari zenean egiten zuen azken gauzarako. Ez zuen gogoratzen lotan zegoenean lotan zegoenean bere sofan, baina bazekekiela urrun zegoen azken lekua, baina ez zuen borrokatu, hala ere, pisuaren aurka borroka egin, ohiko armetan zegoenean.

Lagundu zuen, eta urteak lagundu zituen. Gaur egun bat besterik ez zen izan...<br/><br/>«Lo egin», esan zuen erraztasunez, baina ez zuen borrokatu, estuki jantzita zegoelako. Eskuak jotzen zuen eta bere kopetaren kontrako eskua eskua bere ongizatearen ebaluazioan sentitzen zen bitartean.<br/><br/>«Behar naiz», esan zuen, bere hitzak bere promesarekin sendo doaz.<br/><br/>Bera ondo zegoen, bizirik zegoen, eta pozik zegoen.<br/><br/>だガれ<br/><br/>ontzi-ontzi<br/><br/>laburpena<br/><br/>Kagome, bere bizitzako une batean, nerabe nerabe bat zen, bere familiaren etxearen barnean deabru bat erasotu zuen arte.

Kagomearen lagun izan zen, Inuyasha, garaiz, eta berarekin bidaiatu zuen, berak, berak, apurtuta, baina ez zen hain erraza eta jende askok nahi zuen harribitxia bere helburuetarako. Suzko deabru gazte bat, tximinoa eta berarekin bidaiatu zuen deabru bat maite zituen, harribitxia berreskuratzeko.<br/><br/>Bere taldea, ordea, ez zen harribitxia osatzeko gauza izan. Horren ordez, bere lagun gehienek gertakari gehienak manipulatu zituzten deabru gaiztoa. Azkenik, harribitxiaren pieza guztiak bildu eta objektu margotu zituen, bere barnean betiko gorde nahi zuen bitxi bat egiteko asmoarekin, harribitxia bizirik mantenduz. Inuyasharen sorgunea izan zen, iluntasunetik salbatu zuena. Azkenean, bere garai naturalera itzuli zen, ordura arte institutua bere denbora-tarteko neska batekin espero zen bezala.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Zergatik egon behar zenuke Twitter-en<br/><br/>Lege-oharra: ez naiz, eta ez dut inoiz esan, gizarte-sare bat, gauza asko pentsatzen duen pertsona bat naiz, eta hori hainbat aldiz etorri da.<br/><br/>Batzuetan, zer erabili nahi dudan jakiteko urteak behar ditut, egia esan, eta Twitter gauza horietako bat izan da.

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Erroko Kanalak<br/><br/>Erroko kanal bat lortzeak abantaila gehien ematen dio pertsona gehienei.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Eliza beheko egurra<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Eliza Beheko Egurra, Highgate<br/><br/>Orain Queen's Wood deitzen da<br/><br/>1860 eta 1880 bitartean, zentroa Londresko hiritik kanpora bota zuten, eta han han zeuden ostatuak aurkitu behar zituzten maizterrei buruz behera utzi zuten.

Aldi berean, 125.000 €-ko elizadiako jabeari saltzeko eskaini zioten zerbitzua, baina hori ere handia izan zen Hornsey-k bere kabuz hazteko.

Hain zuzen ere, The Grave Pit Wood idazleak ‘Goi-mailako egur’ deitzen dio idazleari, baina ez zaio baimenik hartu, ez eta barrutiari ere, urte hauetan zehar behin eta berriz ere atzera bota behar izan zuten, baina jende gehienak alde batera utzi zuen. Batzordeak ez zuen bigarren egur bat kenduko, inork esan zuena, eta jarrera hori amaieran mantendu zen.<br/><br/>1895eko ekainaren 8ko ordutegitik aurrera, 5 lorategietako H.S.Kamberlainek erosketa eskatu zion orduaren 8an.<br/><br/>Badakit ohikoa dela Etikako Batzorde Kolegioaretaz hitz egitea, baina, diru-bilketako patronatuek abantaila handiena erdiesten dutelako, eta, beraz, egurraren eraispena behar bezala egin bada, badirudi soilik soilik pertsonei libre eta libreak ematen ari direla, eta ziur nago Artzain Onaren eremuan erosketa bat egitea, konpainia txiki bat sortuz. Hain zuzen ere, enpresa txiki bat da hori, arrakastarako zelaiak ziurtatzea helburutzat hartzen duena, ernamuina eta abar.<br/><br/>(Horrek zuzentzen du The Crouch Ending Field delakoa, urte batzuk geroago ziurtatuak izan zirenak).<br/><br/>Muswell Hillen elkarte kontserbadoreko presidente naizen aldetik, etengabe harremanetan nago biztanleekin, eta ziurtatu dezaket auzoko pertsona bakoitzak ezer gordeko lukeela.<br/><br/>(Gero pertsonalki nahi zuen karitateko diru-sarrera bat bere herri pobreei sostengua ematea, bere lur-karrerari galdetu zion - ez ziur aski - Komisarioen lana ez zela arriskuan zegoela uste zuen).<br/><br/>'Muswell Hill Road Hornseyko onena zen eta berdin ederra, etxe edo etxerik gabe jarraituko zuen'.<br/><br/>(eta gero, loraketa erretorologiko handia etorri zen).<br/><br/>'Behar zaitezte jasan behartsuen objekzio sentimentalak eta otsoen negar historikoa zure ahanzturagatik? Zerbait egin behar da eta laster. «Barruko tasatzaile batek ez luke inolako desberdintasunik egingo lurrari; izan ere, haren etekinak alde batera utzi zuen zahartzaroak eta merezi zuenak urritu egin ziren urte hauetan, eta gure ondorengoei balio handia emango zien, etorkizun urrunean, Hornseyko parrokiaren pobreei laguntzeko.».<br/><br/>Bere gutun-azalaren zentzumenak irakurtzen zituen. Zergatik uste zuen komisarioek bide bat eraiki nahi zutela? Zergatik diru hori guztia gastatu behar lukete etxe bat eraiki ezean? Inoiz ez zuen konturatu lur-aberastasun osoa galduko zela, baina arazoarekin egon zen denbora luzez. Komisarioek 25.000 urte lehenago salmenta-eskaintza egin zuten eta bere izena Crouch End Clock Tower-en ohorez banatzen da egurra aurrezteko, baina komisario klasikoetan zuen konfiantza agerian geratzen da. Errauskarietan deabrua bezala galdatua izan behar zuela esaten da.<br/><br/>Kontsulta jarraitua<br/><br/>1895eko ekainaren 15ean, Highgate-n inauguratu zen, eta bilera handi bat egin ondoren, Kontseilu Errektorea erabat aldatu zen. Ohiko mahaiak kendu eta aulkiak bete ziren. Zazpi t'erdiko aldea jendez gainezka egon zen, eserlekuak dituzten pertsonak.<br/><br/>Murray jaunak, Komisarioak, galdera oso erraza zela esan zuen. Hornsey Parochial Charies lur zati bat erosi nahi zuen bere jabetzaren ondoan. Auzia izan zen Batzorde Karitatenala, karitate guztiak kontrolatzen zituena, indar nahikoa izan zuena gelditzeko. Elizako komisarioak oso mesedegarriak ziren lurra saltzeko eta karitatearen diru-sarrerak asko handitu ziren.<br/><br/>Horren aurka hiru objekzio klase zeuden.<br/><br/>Jatorrizko konfiantza pobreei etxe-jabeak eskaintzeko asmoa zuen, baina nekazariak pobreentzat oso garestiak ziren hiribilduak eraikitzeko proposamena egin zuten. Hala ere, Patronatuaren boterepean zegoen konfiantza-baldintzak aldatzeko, eta, ondorioz, hiribilduak eraiki ahal izango zituzten, pobreak bukaeran onurak izango zituztela pentsatuz gero. Pertsona txiroek, ordea, haientzako lege liberalak proposa zitzaketen, galderaren alderdi estetiko eta publikoarekin lotutako hirugarren objekzioaren aurka. Hark irakurri zuen karitate-batzordeak bere jabetzari buruz erabakitzeko erabakia urratu behar zuela.<br/><br/>Galdera honek puntu finak eztabaidatu zituen, baina hiztunek egurraren edozein suntsipena ekiditeko arazo handira itzuli ziren. 30.000 pertsona ordezkatzen dituen Islingtoneko beteranoak protesta formal bat egin zuen basoaren edozein zatiri buruz, beraz, Iglesias eta Hornseyko jendeentzat baliagarria izan zen helburu pribatuetarako. Mr Wilfred White-ek esan zuen Batzordeak dirua biltzeko dirua biltzeko gai izango balira.<br/><br/>Beaumont jaunak esan zuen ez zirela herrixkak nahi, auzotik atera ziren pertsonentzako etxolak nahi zituztela. Beste batzuek diotenez, ez zen dirurik izan gaur egun bahituak ordezkatzeko, baizik eta hiribilduak izango ziren proposamen ekonomiko bat. Beste batzuek berri izan zuten, beste batzuek, ordea, hiribilduko diru-sarrerak izan zirela esan zuten, Highgate-n. Makilatu basoaren galderari.<br/><br/>Fletcher doktoreak esan zuen langile baten arteko oihua zegoela han, eta jendea etorri zen negarrarekin: “Gozturatik libratu gara, eta herri berri batera joan behar gara”. Muswell Hillen errepidearen fronterik ez bazen ere, errepide horiek Hornseyko norabideko basoetatik moztu zitezkeen, baina komisarioek ezin izan zuten errepidea moztu.<br/><br/>Oso ziur zegoen etxeak konponketa egoera egoki batean jar zitezkeen. Herri pobreek, Poliziak eta langile-klase batzuek eskatu zuten bi puntu horiek irudikatzeko, landa-ostatu hori oso gutxi behar zen goi-mailan, eta, behin lurra salduz gero, ez zegoen esaten non egongo zen eraikitzailearen eskua egongo zenik.<br/><br/>(Lod eta luzetako txinoak).<br/><br/>Beste pertsona askok hitz egin zuten eta konusatzaileak esaten zuen: lehen iritzi hori hartu zuen etxeak zaintzeko, baina bilerak ez zuela ondoriorik atera esan zuenetik (Gornesek).<br/><br/>Beste batzuek diotenez, karitateko Patronatuak porrot egin zuen bere eginkizunetan, eta, horrela, hiribilduak sakabanatu egin ziren.<br/><br/>R. R. Williams jauna, aurreko artikuluari buruz idatzi zuena, Elizako komisarioek ez zutela inolako errepiderik egingo esan zuen, eta komisarioen ekintzen bidez ezin zuten lortu. Beste batzuk ez ziren hain fidagarriak eta topaketa ia hiru orduren buruan itxi zen.<br/><br/>«Izan ere, Highgate-en eta Muswell Hill-en Elizako Beheko Behera nahi duten pertsona batzuk daude, eta ez dira pozik egongo, inork ez badu opari bat ordaindu nahi. Pertsona orok dio egurra espazio ireki gisa izateko gauza ona izango zela, baina denek uste dute beste norbait egiteko betebeharra dela. Islingtoneko txalekoak gaian 'guitu' izan du, baina ez du dirurik eskaintzen. --- Ez dago arazorik komunitatearentzat edo banakoarentzat beste pertsona baten ondasunak nola eskuratzen dituen baino."<br/><br/>Parekatua izan zen, izan ere, Elizatxoko Egurra eztabaida biziaren gaia izan zen. Baterako batzorde bat eratu zen egurra salbatzeko. 1896ko azaroaren 20an, C.F. Cory-Wrightek, Honor Treasures idatzi zuen eta egun horretan, laguntza eskeinaldi bat idatzi zuen. Zura galtzeko arrisku guztiak gogorarazi zituen, eta erosketa egin ondoren bakarrik gorde ahal izango zela esan zuen. Elizako komisarioek 25.000 £ saltzen zituzten eta beste 500.000 £eko isolatzeko (5.000 £), hau da, Hornsey Council-entzat askoz ere askoz ere gehiago, baina dagoeneko 10.000 £ eman zituzten guztira. Basoak Londresko iparraldeko guztientzako balio izugarria zuten, eta, beraz, gainontzeko erakunde eta pertsona pribatuei £2 20.000 eskatu zien. Aipatu zuen gaur egungo Eliza Komisarioen eskaintza 1898ko amaieran bakarrik ireki zela. Horren ondoren, eraikitzaileak mugituko dira.<br/><br/>Salmentak harrera ona izan zuen, eta Saloi Pribatu bat lege bihurtu zen, 1897ko abenduan.Kontinoak laguntza emateko eskubidea izan zuen, egurra erosteko eta hura kontserbatzeko.<br/><br/>Oso denbora gutxian dirua ia guztia altxatu zen, baina azken milak igoera oso zaila izan zen eta Komisioen epea aste batzuetakoa izan zen. Cory-Wright jaunak denbora gehiago eskatzen idatzi zuen, baina hiru hilabete baino ez zituen eman eta, ondoren, ehuneko 4ko intereserako zenbateko osoan ordainduko bazen. Londresko konderriaren amaieran, jatorriz 2.000 £ eskaini zituena, hau 5.000 £-ra igo zen, eta guztizkoa iritsi zen, baina oso gertu zegoen.<br/><br/>Kontseiluak Wood izenarekin berriz izendatu zuen, Viktoria Erreginaren Di Diamond Jubilee eta Hornsey erreginaren omenez, eta Albaniako Dukeak formalki adierazi zuen “publikoarentzat libre” hitza erabiltzea.<br/><br/>Churchilleko Wooden aurkako kanpainari amaiera eman zioten bitartean, bertako jendeak modu sutsu batean sentitu zuten baso zati hau, hogeita hamar urte baino gehiagoan antzeko kanpainetan parte hartu zuten jende sare handi baten laguntza eta esperientzia. Batzordeak errekurtsoa eman zuen, kalitate oneko paperarekin inprimatua eta izen ospetsu batzuk eman zituena.<br/><br/>Espazio irekiaren eta osasun publikoaren galderak Victoriaren ikuspegiaren gai nagusiak ziren.<br/><br/>Espazio irekien mugimendua<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, Marylebone, hiru etxe zaharrekin hasi zena, Jim Ruskinek erosi zuena, azkar bihurtu zen baldintza gogorrenetan pertsona txiroak zeuden etxebizitzan. Bere bidea lenteak erosi eta gero etxe jendetsuenetako batzuk bota, argia eta airea ekartzeko, aire freskoa eta argia modu bakarra jendea «purdiko sukarretik salbatua» izan zitekeela. Hau bere aitonaren semea zen, Southwood Smith, eta bere teoriak garatu zituen erregearen Gurutzean.<br/><br/>Jendeak behar zituen lehen Etxebizitza Industrialak eraiki zituen eta, estatistikoki, aire ona eta drainatzea salbatu zituen. Gibson lorategiak, North Wald Road-en emaitza zuzena da.<br/><br/>Aire irekiaren garrantzia<br/><br/>Espazio irekiak eta aire garbia arnasteko aukerak funtsezkoak ziren gela batean edo bitan bizi zirenentzat. Octavia Hillek Lisson Grove slumetatik hartzen zituen karguak, Fitzjohnko Avenue-tik Hamstead Heath-era. Beraz, gustuko izan zituen Fitzjohnko Avenue zelaiak, parke publiko gisa erosi nahi izan zituenak, 100.000 €-ko kostuarekin eta abuztuaren 3an 8.500 €-ko igoerarekin. Udako oporren amaiera baino ez zen behar, eta, ondoren, 1.500 €-ko itzuli izan zen, baina jabeek uko egin zioten beren eskaintzari. Hala ere, landa-eremu guztiak etxe handiz estali zituzten.<br/><br/>Hortik aurrera, kanpaina hasi zen, Lisson Groveko hurrengo espazio irekia, eta, bide batez, eraikitzaileengandik distantzia iraunkorra lortzeko bidea hartu zuen, adreiluen aurka. Parlamentuko Hillfields kanpaina hain arrakastatsua izan zen Hamstead Health-en deia gainditu eta diru asko egon zela bertan, diru hori eta espazio irekietarantz, National Trust-en garatzea izan zen. Octavia Hillek duela zenbait urte elizako Egurra bezalako eremuak babestu nahi izan zituen, beraz, aliatu naturala izan zen Egurra salbatzeko borrokan.<br/><br/>Komunen kontserbaziorako gizartea ere ezaguna zen mota honetako agitazio eta diru bilketarekin. Buruko jaunek lur komuneko piezak itxi zituzten, bai legez kanpoko bai legez kanpoko borrokak zuzentzen zituzten lurrak modu tradizionalean pribatizatuta erabiltzearen aurka. Robert Hunter, 1868ko ohorezko Solitorlea, espazio irekiak, handiak edo txikiak babesteaz arduratzen zen beti, publikoarentzat. Orain, Robert Hunter, Elizaren Beheko Sagarra bihurtu zen. Komunen Babeserako Sozietateko presidentea izan zen Shaw-Levever MP (geroago Lord Eversley) eta beste kanpaina batzuetan parte hartu zuen Komunen Etxean.<br/><br/>Aldi berean, Oktaia muinoa lurperatzeko gerra hasi zen.<br/><br/>Hiri-elizak oso beterik zeuden eta osasunarekiko arrisku larri bat, jendea ur edangarria marrazten zuten putzuak kutsatuz, hiri-lurzoruak ez zirelako utzi. Horren ordez, hilerriak sortu ziren, hiribilduko kanpoaldean. Abney Park hilerria izan zen horietako bat. Garai hartan, alde batetik, baselizak alde zaharretik kentzeko mugimendua egin zen, beste leku batzuetan gorputzak berriro sartu eta hilerriak lorategi eta espazio irekietara eraman, eta, bestetik, bertan eraikitzeko modua izan zen. Londresko erdialdean dagoen lur hau oso baliotsua zen eta bertan espekularrek lortu ahal izan zuten: «Karatzaileek ere beren hilerrietako bat eraiki zuten, eta horrela egin zuten berriro ere Bunhill Fieldsen gainean. Octavia Hillek aliatuen sare bat izan zuen dozena bat eremutan, eta, beraz, Elizaren behea salbatzeko laguntza baliotsua izan behar zuen.<br/><br/>1882an sortutako Lorategi Metropoliarraren Sozietateak berrehun lorategi txiki inguru zituen hiri-zentrotan; geroago, Tokiko agintariei laga zieten, beraz, elizako Beheko Apelazioaren alde egin zuten.<br/><br/>Gaur egun, Kyrle Gizartea ahaztu egiten da, baina bere garaian eragin handia izan zuen Hirigintzan eta Espazio Irekian. Gizartea 1875ean jarri zen abian ‘Benetako difusio’-ren alde, kolorea eta interesak giro triste batean, ilunean, kolore distiratsua bilduz hormak eta dekorazioa, kantu ona, espazio irekiak, natura, literatura eta artea. Horiek guztiak gizartearen konpromisoaren baitan gelditu ziren, eta William Morrisek hitzaldietan parte hartu zuen, bertako eraikinetan koruak eta gau zoriontsuak sustatzeko. Garaiko gutunen arabera, elkarteak liburuak eta aldizkako argitalpenak deitu zituen, neska-mutilentzat, etxeentzat eta beste leku batzuetan. Hala ere, Espazio Irekien Batzordea aktiboa izan zen. Kyle' izena The Man of the Rossetik dator, parke publiko gisa bere jaioterria eman zion filantropoa. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | 21 urtetik beherako pertsonek alkoholik gabe erabiltzea osasun publikoaren arazo garrantzitsu gisa identifikatu da. Ikerketek adierazten dute desgaitasunaren arriskuak areagotzen direla eta garunaren garapena kaltegarria izan daitekeela. Edaten dutenek aukera gehiago dute beren buruaz beste egiteko, legea hausteko, edo indarkeriaren biktimak izateko. Alkohola gazteen trafiko-mugaren ia heren batean inplizitu egiten da.Urteko edateko kostu osoa $ 62 bilioitan kalkulatzen da. Nahiz eta estatu mailan legez kanpoko edateko arriskua prebenitzeko legeak bete diren, lege-jarduera eta interes handia izan dira estatuek arazoari aurre egin ahal izateko egiten dioten ahaleginak. Txosten horretan deskribatuko da zer neurritan erabil daitekeen alkoholik gabeko erabilera, gai honi buruzko lege-jarduera berria eta hainbat politika-ondorioz, datu berri gisa eguneratuta egongo dela. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?
