| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - CC2000 serieko Bibliaren atalaren bidez Eginak, kapitulu bat, lehen eliza aztertzen hasi ginenean.<br/>Lukeek, Paul apostoluaren lagun batek, ebanjelioari buruzko bi tratatu hauek idatzi zizkion Lukasen arabera. Teofilo izena da, zentzu eder bat duena. Batzuek Jainkoaren maitalea dela esan nahi dute. Batzuek uste dute ez zela gizon bat, baizik eta ebanjelioa eta Eginak liburua Jainkoaren maitaleei buruzkoa izan zela. Badaude beste tradizio batzuk, Teofilo Luken maisua zela esaten dutenak, egun horietan medikuak esklaboak zirela, normalean aita dirudun baten esklabo. Lukeen maisua Theophilus zela eta Paulekin egon zen, beraz, Luke bere antzinako maisuarengana itzuli da. Elizaren lehen tradizioa da, baina, noski, ezinezkoa da, tradizio askok bezala.<br/>Batzuek uste dute Pablo Troian zegoela eta gizon baten ikuskari bat jaso zuela esaten ziotena: “Gora zaitez Mazedoniatik eta lagundu”, gizon hori Paulen ikuskariarena Lukas baino ez zen. Zeren lehenengo eta behin Pablok bildu zuena, bera arduratu zenean Mazedoniara, eta Eginak liburuan gauden bezala, aurkituko duzu noiz joaten garen Eginak Liburuan, Luke hirugarren pertsona baino gehiago idazten hasten den. Horregatik da, argi eta garbi, Apostoluen Eginak puntu berezi honetan, Luke Paulen lagun bihurtu zen eta berarekin hasi zen ibiltzen. "gu" eta "gu" abestien ordez "gu" eta "eu" abestien ordez erabiltzen hasi zen. Hau da, zalantzarik gabe, non Luke parte-hartzaile eta gauza horien lekuko bihurtu zen garai honetan, puntu horretara iristen garenean.<br/>Apostoluen Eginak hasi zituen kantuz Lukeren arabera, eta bere ebanjelioan gordetzen den azken gauza bera da Apostoluen Eginak kontatzen duen lehen gauza. Lukasen ebanjelioa aurkitzen dugu, bere dizipuluei itxaroten ari den bitartean Jerusalemen, boterez beterik egon arte, eta gero, Jesus zerura igo zen, eta, beraz, ebanjelioa ixten du.<br/>Lehenengo tratatua [hau da, Ebanjelioa, Lukasen arabera] idatzi dizut, O teolioa, hori guztia hasi zen egiten eta irakasten (Eginak 1:1),<br/>Jainkoaren esana ez da Jesu Kristoren Ministerioaren istorio osoa, baizik eta Jesus Mesiasen premiari men egiten jarraitzen duena. Jesusek gaixoari jarraitzen dio. Jesusek hildakoak altxatzen jarraitzen du. Jesusek bere maitasuna eta bere ebanjelioa mundura ministratzen jarraitzen du, bakarrik bere Espiritu Santuarekin gantzutua izan diren dizipuluen bitartez. Baina Kristoren Ministerioa etengabe ari da eraikitzen, batez ere Lukas apostoluen egintzak hartzen dituen premisa da, hau da, Jesusen antzinako tratatua, bai egin eta irakastekoa.<br/>Orain, horregatik, apostoluen Eginak liburu amaigabea da: gaur egun Jainkoaren tresna izan direnen bizitzaren bidez lanean jarraitzen du Jaunak. Gidatua eta gidatua izan dadin eta gantzutua bere Espiritu Santuaz, jarrai dezan Jainkoaren Ministerioa gaur egun. Orain, Jainkoak agindu du bere lana giza instrumentuen bidez burutu behar dela. Jainkoak izaki aingeruak erabil ditzake bere lanerako, eta denbora bat etorriko da, Jainkoak aingeruek erabiliko duenean bere Ebanjelioa munduari aldarrikatuko diona. 14. atala. «Munduaren zehar hegan egiten ari den lehenengo aingerua» izan da (Apokalipsia 14:6). Baina une honetan, Jainkoak giza instrumentuak erabiltzea erabaki du. Hori dela eta, Jainkoak erabiliko zaitu, eta Jainkoak erabiliko zaitu. Hainbeste aldiz, ez dugu hitz egin beharrik, Jauna, ez dut inoiz hitz egin beharrik, Jainkoaren deietik kanporatua izaten saiatzen den heinean. Jeremiasek esan zuen: “Jauna, haurtxo bat besterik ez naiz; inork ez dit entzun nahi.” Eta denok ditugu erabiliak izan ahal izateko gure aitzakiak. Ez dakigu zergatik ezin gaituen erabili Jainkoak erabili.<br/>Behin, Jauna, profeta bati bere lana egiteko eskatu ziona, esan zion: «Jauna, bidali nahi duzun guztia», esan zuen Jaunak: «Jauna, deitu dizut». Beraz, askotan, toki horretan gaude: “Jauna, bidali zure buruaren bidez, edozein Jainko, Jauna baizik.” Eta, hala ere, Jainkoak gu erabiltzeko agindua eman digu.<br/>Orain, gutako bakoitzak bere akatsak antzeman ditzake. Gutako bakoitzak gure gaitasun propioak adieraz ditzake, eta guztiok aurki dezakegu zergatik ez didazu erabili nahi. Baina hala ere, Jainkoak aukeratu zaitu zu erabiltzeko. Zure bizitzan zehar, berak mundu behartsu bati errebelatuko dio: galdezka ari zara Jainkoak tresna hauek erabiltzea, nola egin zuen lana, ez?<br/>Hartu zen egunera arte, Espiritu Santuaren bitartez agindu zien, hautatu zituen apostoluei (Eginak 1:2).<br/>Hori da bukatu zuena, Lukasen Ebanjelioa bukatu zuena, Jesus hartu zuten eguna, aingeruei esan zietenen botereari itxaroteko.<br/>Berari ere, berak erakutsi ziela bizirik bere pasioaren ostean [edo heriotzaren] froga galezin askoren bidez (Eginak 1:3),<br/>Zaila da Jesukristoren berpiztearen gertaera ukatzea, haserretu eta narriatu egin nintzela, Santa Anako azken larunbatean irakurri nuen artikulu baten bidez. Ikastetxeetan aurkezten diren zientzia eta teoria ebolutiboari esker, irakasleak zientzia-eskola bat nola irakasten duen esan zuen, eta, beraz, ez dute lekurik teorian. Izan ere, zientzia erlijio-erlijarioetan oinarritzen da, eta fedea asko hartzen du teoria erlijiosoak sinesteko. Faktoreekin lan egitean, onartu egin ditzakezu. Oso interesgarria iruditu zitzaidan "zientzia klase hartan, mundua lau mila milioi urte zela ikusita, eta gaur egun irakasten dute mundua hamabi mila milioi urte dituela. Eta ez zen izan aspaldi eskolara joan nintzenik”.<br/>Interesgarria da Bibliak ez duela inoiz berrikusi edo eguneratu gizonezkoek aurkitu dituzten uneko datuak betetzeko. Eta, hala ere, nire institutuko zientzia testu liburuak hartu eta zientzia klase bat irakasten saiatuz gero, eskola handi batean zientzia bezala irakasten ziren gauza asko aurkituko dituzu. Zelula soileko protoplasma ez da jadanik zelula sinple bat, baina oso konplexua. Historian arrastorik badago, Jesusen berpizkundeak hildakoaren ondorio da.<br/>jurisprudentzia sistema bat dugu, lekuko lekuko lekuko lekuko lekuko lekukoen arabera oinarritzen dena. Gizon batek delitu bat leporatuko balu eta krimena egin zela ikusi zuten jendeak daude, eta araura eramanak dira, egia esateko, egia osoa, eta ezer ez, beraz, Jainkoari laguntzen diote. 20ko maiatzaren 3an ikusi nuen gizon hura, bere autoaren kontra ateratzen zela, diru guztia ematen zitzaiona entzun nuen, bankutik atera zen. Ikusi nuen bera kanpoan zegoela. Eta hiru edo lau lekuko gizon horiengana hurbildu eta haien testigantza mantendu ahal izan ezkero, hil dadin epaitua izango da. Gizaki horri buruzko istorio bera frogatzen duten bi edo hiru lekuko ditugu, eta onartzen da delitua gurtzen zuena eta erruduna dena. Testiganak dauzkazula, egia frogatzeko.<br/>Jesus hil ondoren, berriro ere, zaurizko testigantza eman zioten askori, ikusi zutelako, eta hainbat tokitan agertu zela. Berrogeita hamar egun haietan egon zen ikustera, eta, aldi berean, leku batean bildu ziren bostehun pertsona baino gehiagora arte, zaila da jende horien lekukotasuna alde batera uztea edo ukatu. Horretarako, gure jurisprudentzia-sistema osoa bereiztea da. Baina ez bakarrik gizon horiek ikusi zutela Jauna, hitz egin zuten Jesusekin, haiek guztiak, bata bestearen eskuetan hil ziren, beren istorioa egiazkoa zela baieztatzen zutelako. Hitz egiten duzue lekukoei egia esateko, egia osoa, ez egia, baizik eta gizaki baten bizia mehatxatua izan bazen lekuko horrengatik, eta gezur bat bazen, gutxienez haiek apurtuko balitu presiopean. «Zenbaxa osoa aitorturik» zioten: «Zenbatek bizia erakutsi zuen, gezurrezko froga asko egin ondoren».<br/>berrogei egunez haien berri ikusteak, Jainkoaren Erreinuari dagozkion gauzei buruz hitz egiten (Eginak 1:3).<br/>Batzuetan, Jainkoaren Erreinuaren galdera dela eta, Jainkoaren Erreinuak Jesu Kristoren alde egin zuela gogoratu behar dugu. Jainkoaren Erreinuaz hitz egiten ari zen beti, eta itxaropen handia da gizon guztien bihotzetara landatzea, gauzak ez baitira beti hondatuko, haiek baitira beti. Mundua ez da betirako joango iluntasunaren botereaz, gaiztakeriaren esklabotzaren menpe, Jainkoaren erreinua lurrean ezarriko du egun batean. Jesusek bere ondorengo txangoa egingo du, eguzkia sartu eta kostaldera hedatuko du bere erresuma. Eta egun hura izango da egun loriatsuena mundua inoiz ikusi duena, gaixotasuna eta oinazea ezabatua izango dena HAREN erreinuan, bekatu eta diruzalekeria bezala, eta mundu hau bezalako toki intolerantzia izan duten gauza hauek, ezabatuak izango dira HAREN erreinuan. Gezurrezko merkataritzak, gizakiaren ustiapenak, gauza guzti horiek bere erreinu lortsuan, errege izaten ari zenean, ez zuen mirakuluzkoik egin behar izan. Eta Jesusek otoitz egiten dugunean esan zigun: «Zuek lurrean egingo dute, zeruan dagoen bezala» (Mateo 6:10), hau da Jainkoaren erreinua. 49 Egun hartan, erresumako erregea zen.<br/>Eta beraiekin bildurik, esan zien ez zutela joan Jerusalemen, baizik eta Aitaren promesaren zain, entzun duzue nitaz (Eginak 1:4).<br/>BERAK esan zuen: “Orain begira, itxaron hemen Jerusalemen, Aitaren promesa jaso arte.” Jaunak esan zion: «Jauna, isuriko dut nire Espiritua haragi guztiaren gain, eta zuen seme eta alabak profetizatuko dute, eta zuen gazteak amets egingo dute, zure adinekoak ikuskariak ikusiko dituzte, eta nire zerbitzarien gain eta nire zerbitzarien gain NIK isuriko ditut nire Espiritua» (Joue 2:28-29). Aitaren promesa: Eguna etorriko da Jainkoaren Espiritua isuriko duenean haragiaren gain, fededun guztien gain, bakoitzak Jainkoaren dinamika jasoko du.<br/>Zeren Joanek esan zuen, benetan bataiatua izan zen urarekin, baina bataiatua izango zara Espiritu Santuarekin ez egun askotan.<br/>Bataiotzea zen ideia, Bataiatzea, bestea urez bataiatua, jendea uretan sarturik, "Espiritu Santuan murgilduta egongo zara egun askotan".<br/>Orain, hara iristean, galdegin zioten: «Jauna, Israelen erreinua» (Eginak 1:6)<br/>«Noiz izango da, Jauna?». Berrerabiltzeko garaia iristen denean, Jesus orain hitz egiten ari da, ez erresumari buruz, baizik eta zerbitzurakoa izango den botereari buruz.<br/>Esan iezaiezu, ez da zuk jakitea zein ordutan jarri den Aitak bere boterean (Eginak 1:7).<br/>«Ez da zuek jakin beharrik». etengabe bizi izan zuten erresumaren finkapenean, eta Jesusen bizitza osoan zehar, edozein unetan, telefono-kabinara sartu eta munduaren salbatzaile gisa atera ziren. Bere boterea erakutsiz eta munduko gobernuei uko eginez, Jainkoaren erreinua lurrean ezarriz, eta egunero aldaketa hau aurrera eramateko zain zeuden. Jesus Jerusalemerat itzuli zenean, gizon bekatariaren eskuetan piztu zen Jesus, eta gero gurutzaturik, "Oi, ez, Jauna, ez duzu ulertzen jainkoa, Jauna, Zugandik urruti egotea baizik". Jesus gurutzean hil zenean, asko etsita zeuden.<br/>Bi dizipuluak Jesusen bidean, hain tristeak dira. Nola heldu zarete hain tristeak bezala “Zer esan nahi duzu?” Zer esan nahi duzu? “Oi, Jesus Nazaretekoa” izeneko lagunartea... ‘Oi, gizon boteretsua’, Jainkoaren gantzudura bere bizitzaren gain egon zen, Israelgo askapena zela espero genuen, baina haiek gurutzatu egin zuten. Orain berpiztua da, eta dio: «Egizue egun gutxi barru, Aitaren promesak», «O, zer agindu du Jainkoaren Erreinuaren konfigurazioa?», «Bai, zilegi izan zen Jainkoaren Jauna?». Garaia da, zuen erregetza orain ezarriko al duzu?" "Ez, zuek ez dakizue garai hauetan Aitak izendatutakoa edo Aitak bere boterean daukana, baizik eta jasoko duzue boterea zuen gain erori denean".<br/>Orain, hemen, Greziako preposizio-epizioa erabiltzen da harreman berri bat emateko Espiritu Santuaz izan behar zutena. 14. atala Joanen arabera, Jesusek Espiritu Santua bidaltzeko promes egiten duen bezala, Jesusek esan zuen: “Ez zaituztet gehiago utziko. NI zuengana etorriko naiz, eta berak bidaliko dizuet Aita, eta bidaliko dizuet beste kontsolamendu bat, baita Egiaren espirituak ezin duena jaso, munduak ez baitu ezagutzen, baina badakizue BERAREKIN bizi dela, eta BERA zuen baitan egongo dela (Joan 14:17-18). Gure jarrera greziarra bera, gurea bezala, bakarrik "in" esaten dute. Bi harreman hauetakoa da: BERA zurekin dago, baina orain Jesus esan du boterea jasoko duzuela Espiritu Santua zure gain datorrenean. Greziako preposizio epiak, New Testamentu osoan zehar testu desberdinetan itzultzen dena "ontzat" edo "gogortzea" edo "gogortzea" bezala, "jarraitzea" bezalakoa da.<br/>Joanen Ebanjelioaren zazpigarren kapituluan: «Benetan, jaiaren egun handia, han zen Jesus Tenpluan, eta jendeari oihu egin zion: «Baina egarririk badago nigana eta edango badut, haren barnetik edango dut ura». Johnek esan zuen: «Honek esan zuen: “Hau ez zen eman oraindik sinesten dutenek berarengana jaso behar dutena» (Joan 7:37-39). Zer hitz egin zuen Izpirituari buruz? Gustatzen zait, “Espiritua gainezkatzean”, edo zure gain, edo zure gain, edo zure gain, gainezkatzen zaitu. Beraz, hiru alde arteko harremana: Hura da zuen aurrean dagoena, bekataria zarela ziurtatzeko eragiten duena, BERA da Jesu Kristori adierazten diona bekatuak estaltzen dituenean, zuzena eta epaitua. Zure bizia eta bihotza Jesusengana irekitzen dituzunean, Espiritu Santua dator eta zu ereintzera gonbidatzen zaitu. Ez al dakizue ez zaretela zuenak, prezio batekin erosiak izan zarete, beraz, Jainkoa zure gorputzean eta zure espirituan aintza eman duzue, eta ez al dakizue zuen gorputza dela Espiritu Santuaren tenplua zuengan dagoena? Ez ezazu ardorik edan, gehiegizkoa baita, edo betea izatea edo Espirituarekin beterik egotea” (1 Korintoarrei 6:19-20, 5:18). Baina orain hirugarren harreman bat da.<br/>Zuek jasoko duzue [dunak] dinamikan, Espiritu Santuak zuen gain etorri zenean [edo zuen gain, edo zuengandik gainezka dagoen tokian], eta zuek testigu izango zarete (Eginak 1:18).<br/>Eta, beraz, dinamikoak, Jesu Kristoren testigantza izan dezan, interesgarria da grezierazko testigantza testigantza gure martiria jasotzen dugun tokian dagoela. Testifikatua da, ez bakarrik sinesten duena, sinesten duena, sinesten duena, bera sinesten duena, eta hain sendo sinesten duena, behar izanez gero, hil egingo dela uste duena, nola indartsu den bere sinesmena. Ezin duzu gelditu, ez zaizu beldur izan zer sinesten duen.<br/>Gogoratzen zara Paulek bere bidean Jerusalemera eta Agabus jaitsi zenean Cesarea-k eta Paul-en gerrillariak bat egin zuten eta esan zuen: “Horrela da gizon hori Jerusalemera sartzen denean!” Eta Paulen lagunak negarrez hasi ziren, esanez: “Oi, Paul, ez joan”, eta esan zuen: Zer esan nahi duzue malko hauengatik? Zure fedea hil dadin prest nago, ez baitzinezu martiria egin; izan ere, zuek heriotzara harrapatuak izan zineten, lekuko bat bazina, sinetsi zenutelako gogor. Beraz, ez zizuen lekuko bat bakarrik erakutsi, lekuko bat izan bazina, ez zenuke inoiz zure heriotzara hurbilduko, berriro esango zenuke: “Nor, zer itxaron, itxaron, itxaron”. Hitz egin dezagun hemen. Nik uste dut akats bat egin dezakezula. Orduan esan zenuen: “Benetan, ez zela maratoia, baina ez zaitu zaldirik botako lapurrik; zaldirik ez da piztuko. Beraz, lapurtuz gero, ez zaizu zaldi lapur bat egiten, bakarrik frogatzen da zuek denok borrokatzen zenutela, martiriak bezala, baizik eta frogan ipiniko zaretela lekuko bat. Eta izango al zarete testigantzako gehienak martiriak ziren?<br/>Hauen lekukoa izan zen Jerusalemen, eta baita Judan ere (Eginak 1:28),<br/>Testua etxean hasi zen, lekurik gogorrena, ez da hain justu Jerusalemen bertan hastea, eta gero, Jerusalemen inguruan, Judea inguruan, eta gero, Samariara hedatu zen. Eta gero, munduaren bazter guztietara irten behar zen, eta Eginak liburua aztertzen dugunez, oso progresioa ikusiko dugu nola hasi zen Jerusalemen, hurrengo kapituluan. Eta gero ikusiko dugu nola hedatzen hasi zen Judeatik, eta ondoren, Phillipek Samariara igo ziren, eta gero Paul eta Barnabaseri deitu zitzaizkion munduko txoko guztietatik. Eta horrela, lekukoak hedatzen dira gantzuduraren eta Espiritu Santuaren boterearen bidez.<br/>Orain, gauza hauek hitz egin zituenean, bera atera zen bitartean, eta hodeia, bere begiradatik jaso zuen (Eginak 1:9).<br/>Jesusek bere ikasleei egindako azken hitza da, hau da, bere igoeraren aurreko azken hitzak, Paulekin eta besteekin hitz egin zuen, baina gero bere igoeraren aurretik, hau da bere azken hitza. Eta honen gainean, gauza hauek hitz egin zituenean, hura ikusten ari zitzaizkion bitartean, HARK hartu zuen eta hodei bat hartu zuen haien begietatik.<br/>Eta zeruko bila zebiltzan bitartean, bera altxatu zenean, bi gizon zeuden, jantzi zuriz zutik (Eginak 10:10).<br/>Aingeruak zirela uste dugu.<br/>Zer esan zuen gainera, zuek, Galileako gizonak, zergatik zerura makurtzen zaudete? Jesus zeruraino eramana, horrela etorriko da zeruan ikusi duzuen moduan (1 Korintoarrei 11:11).<br/>Ikusi zuten bera zerura igo zenean eta berriro ikusiko dute: “Begira hamar mila santu hurbiltzen denean, Jaunak lurra epaitua izateko”. Eta orduan, «Gu maitatu eta eman ziguna eta gure Jainkoari eman diona», «Gure Jainko, Errege eta apaizak lur gainean biziko direnak, Jaunak etorriko dira, eta begi guztiek ikusiko dute, eta barre egingo dute» (Apokalipsia 1:5-7). Beraz, Jaunaren etorrerak, haren lekuko guztiek ikusiko dute. Jehoba bera jada etorriko dela dio, baina sekretu bat izan zen, ikusten zituen dizipuluak baino ez baitzituen, Jehobaren lekukoen dizipuluak baizik. Baina Jesusek esan zuen: «Zentzuan etorri da, eta ganbera sekretu batean sartu da, ez sinetsi» (Mateo 24:26). Beraz, Jesus sinestea erabaki behar duzu.<br/>«Jesusek zerurantz eramango duena, horrela etorriko da zeruan ikusi duzun bezala».<br/>Orain, bada bertso interesgarri bat Joanen II. kapituluan: “Mendebari askok ez dute Kristo haragian etortzen” (Hasiera 1:7). Zeren, gaur egungo garaiotan, eta itzuliak izan behar dute: «Jainkoa haragian etor dadin». Haiek ukatzen dute Jesu Kristo haragian etor dadin. Zer dio Joanek: “Adiskide eta Antikristo dira? Begira ezazu zeure buruari, ez dugu galdu behar egin ditugun gauzak, baina sari osoa jasotzen dugu, Kristoren doktrinan lotsatzen eta errespetatzen duena, ez duena Jainkoa. Christen doctrinán egoiten dena, Aita eta Semea ditu, eta zure ateetik sartzen ez bada (larunbata goiz hartan) eta ez ekarri doktrina hau, ez jaso zure etxera, eta ez eman biezaio onik. Zeren berak ematen duena ontzat bere egintza gaiztoen partaidea da (Joan 1:7-11). Galdera bat egin zien: «Jainkoa haragian datoz», eta ez badute esaten, gogoratu Joanek ohartu zintuena eta Joanek esan zizun. «Baina ez baldin bada Jesu Kristo haragian etortzen», oroitu al zara dizipuluekin zegoenean, eta esan zuen: «Egizue nik jan, espirituak ez jan, ukitu niri». Beraz, hau bera gertatzen ari da berriro zerura joaten ikusi zuten modu berean, eta ni, zeren, uste dut datorrena laster dela.<br/>Gero, itzuli ziren Jerusalemera, Olibondo izeneko menditik, Jerusalemera, hau da, Jerusalemen, Sabbatheko eguna, bidaian [mila bi herenak]. Eta sartzen ciradenean goiko gela batean sartzen ziren, non Pedro eta Iacques, Ioannes, eta Andriu, eta Philippe, eta Thomas, eta Mattheo, Iacques Alpheoren semea eta Simon Zelotes, eta Iuda Iacquesen anayea. Eta hauek denak jarraitzen zuten ados otoitz eta otoitz batean, emakumeekin, eta Maria Jesusen ama, eta bere anaiekin (1 Pedro 1:12-14).<br/>Hau da Jesusen ama Maria ere, une honetan eta hemendik aurrera, ez dago aipatu behar beste aipamenik bere apostoluen Eginak edo herriko pasarteetan, ezta heriotza edo Zerura igoera ere, heriotzarik gabe. Ez da ezer aipatzen Eskrituran, isila da.<br/>Anaiak, ziur aski, James eta Judasi eta Jose eta Maria seme-alabak zeuden beste anaiei erreferentzia izango lirateke.<br/>Goiko gelan Jesusen azken afaria bere dizipuluekin zegoen gela berdina zegoela esaten duten batzuk daude, eta, hala ere, tenpluko gel bat mantentzen duten beste batzuk, lehen eliza elkartzen ziren tenpluan. Hartu zure aukera.<br/>Eta egun haietan Pierrisec iaiquiric cequión discipuluen artean, eta erran ceçan, (horién izenen kopuruak ehun eta hogei inguru içan ciraden artean) eta anayeri, Eskritura hau bete behar da, Daviden ahoak hitz egin zuena Judasi buruz, gida bat ezarria izan zena Jesusi buruz (Eginak 11:15-16).<br/>Hemen berriz ere, Pedrok gauza bera jarraitzen du, otoitzean eta otoitzean itxaroten daude eta Pedrok esaten du: “Jarraitu, bete beharreko hitza dago”. Eta zeuk jakingo duzu aurrera egingo duela: “Gogo dezagun programa, bota dezagun eta Judasen lekua hartuko duena”, nik uste dut berriro zegoela haragian, uste dut Pedro haragian zegoela, haren izaera inpektibo hori. Eta uste dut elizaren etorkizuneko historia hau adierazi izana, Pedrori Eskrituraren ulermena interesatzen zaitla, Itun Zaharrean hainbeste tokitatik nola ateratzen den. Peter-ek Itun Zaharraren deskribapen oso ondo ulertzen du, zein garrantzitsua den bere mesederako.<br/>Gogoan izan Pedrok Espiritu Santuari aitortzen dizkionak Davidek idatzi zituenak: “Liburu Santuetan idatzia Jainkoaren inspiraziotik ematen da.” Zeren, esaten badidazue Eskrituraren zati hori Jainkoak inspiratua dela, orduan, galdetu behar dizut: “Zein zati dira inspirazio bidez, eta zein zati ez dira inspirazio bidez?”. Eta gero, zuek zarete orduan esaten didatenak sinesten dutela eta ezin dudana sinetsi. Eta Jainkoa jada ez dela aginterik oraindik, arazoetan nago. Kontuz Eskritura guztiak ezin dutela sinetsi! Eskriturak diote: “Liburu Sainduak Jainkoaren inspiraziotik ematen du.” Eta hemen, Lukask, Pedro zer esan zuenean, David benetan Espiritu Santuaren bozeramailea zela adierazten du, Daviden ahoz esanez.<br/>Zeren zenbakituak izan ziren gure artean, [ hamabietako bat zen] berak ministerio honen zati bat lortu zuen, baina orain gizon honek eremu bat erosi zuen gaizkileen sariarekin, eta jausi zen (Eginak 17:17-18),<br/>Zelaia erosi zuen, Zakariasen bosgarren kapitulua adierazten du.<br/>eta burua erori, bere erdian lehertu zen, eta bere heste guztiak atera ziren (Eginak 1:18).<br/>Eskrituraren desadostasuna aurkitzen dutenak, zeren ebanjelioetako batean esan digute Judasek itzuli eta dirua lortzen saiatu zirenean, eta haiek zioten: “Zeure arazoa da”. Eta ezin dugu berriro ipini tenpluan. Gero, tenpluko lurrean bota eta burua makurtu egin zuen, Pedrok esan zigun aurrera egin zuela, eta hor daude desadostasun bat irudikatzen dutenak. Oso erraza zen, zuhaitzera igo zen bere burua zintzilikatzeko, sokaren inguruan lotu eta besoari lotu eta salto egin zuen. Eta eroritako indarra soka edo buruari lotu zitzaion, eta kanoi gainean erori zen eta hemen esan zuen bezala.<br/>Senar-emazte guztiei buruzkoa izan zen; eremu hori aldoma, hau da, odol-eremua. Zeren idatzia dago Salmoen liburuan, “Ez bedi bere habitatea deuseztatzea, eta ez dezala gizakirik bertan bizi: eta bere apezpikuak beste bat utzi zuen (Eginak 1:19-20).<br/>Orain hemen bi Salmoetatik aipatzen da: Pas 69:25; berak elkartzen ditu 10:8-an, eta elkarrekin jartzen ditu bi profezia hauek Judasi buruz.<br/>Hori dela eta, gizon hauek (Eginak 1:21)<br/>Hemen dago norbait bilatzen ari den norbait Judas apostolu izateko, hementxe daude bilatzen ari diren tituluak.<br/>Horregatik, gizon hauek gurekin egon dira gurekin batera, Jauna Jesus gure artean eta gu artean (Eginak 1:21).<br/>Orain gogoratzen duzue dizipulu ugari zeuden, hamar apostolu aukeratu zituzten dizipuluak, eta hitzek hau esan nahi du: «Seme bat bidalia izan dadin», edo aukeratu zuen hamabi apostoluak izan daitezen, beraz, bidali zuen giza gobernua. Judasen tokia baino ez dugu behar, baina behar dugu gurekin egon den guztia, hasieratik Jesusekin batera.<br/>Johnek bataiatu zuenetik, beragandik jaso zen egunera arte, agindua izan behar du bere berpizkundearen lekuko izateko (Eginak 1:22).<br/>Beraz, horiek dira bilatzen ari zirenaren baldintzak: Joanen bataioa egin zuen pertsona bat garaitik igoerara arte, eta, beraz, berpiztu egin zen Jauna, berpizteari buruzko testigantza eman ahal izan zuen.<br/>Orain Paul Apostoluak, geroago, apostolu bat zela esatean, honakoa esan zuen: «Ez ote dut ikusi Kristo berpiztua?», «Batzuek, apostoluak?», «Gaur, ez al dakit gaur? Ez dut uste zentzu berean daudela Itun Berrian, eta ziur gaur egun ez dago nork dakiela berpizkundearen lekuko izango, egin zuten bezala.<br/>2 Josek Barbas izendatu zuten, Jesus abizenak zuena, eta Matiasek otoitz egin zuen, eta esan zuen: «Ez, Jauna, gizon guztien bihotza ezagutzen duena, aukeratu dituzun bi hauena» (Eginak 1:23-24).<br/>Askotan uste dut akats hau egiten dugula bi aukera emateko, gaizki, Jainkoaren esana ikusten dugu. Hain zuzen ere, hau egiteko prest gaude. Jakina, Paulo Jainkoaren erabakia zen. Pedrori egia esan zion: –Bai, zerbait egin behar dugu, jakin duzu, lagundu Jainkoarekin. Ba al dakizu, falta dela eta bete behar dugula.” Eta hala ere, bi hauetako bat nahi duzu?” eta bi aukera eman zituen Jainkoak.<br/>Hark Ministerio honen parte har lezake eta apostolu hau Judas erori zen, hura bere tokira joan ahal izan zedin, eta horrela haien diruak eman zituzten (Eginak 1:25-26).<br/>Jainkoaren nahia zein den jakin nahi zuten modu interesgarri bat: Jainkoaren nahia zein den jakin behar zuten, zein den hemen Jainkoaren nahia zein den jakin. Orain, Itun Zaharreko garaietan, gauza interesgarriak izan zituzten apaizengana hurbiltzeko, haiek eskatzen baitzuten Jauna Uritik eta kiramatik, «argiak eta perfekzioak», «Zer zen Um eta Tximik?» horiek, ez dakigu. Ziur nago Joseph Smithek urrezko pilulak aurkitu zituen koloretako betaurrekoak ez zirela; betaurreko magikoak jarri dituzunean, bat-batean irakur ditzakezu idazkera hieroglifikoa.<br/>Badaude horiek diotenak benetan zuri-beltza zela eta apaizaren bularraldean ipinitako harri zuri bat. Haiek otoitz egiten zuten eta Jauna galdera berezi bati egiten zioten. Gogoratzen duzu Davidek galdera hauek behin betiko eskatzen zituela: «Jauna, ». Hau zen erantzuna, hurrengo egunean, «Ez, Jauna», «Filisten kontra aterako ote gara?». Hurrengo egunean, «Zer erantzun nahi dugu?». Galdera zehatzak egingo zituzten, eta Jaunak zuzenean zuzenduko lituzke, apaizak otoitz egingo zuela esan zuten, Jainkoa bilatu, eta gero bi harrietako bat ateratzen. Harri zuria balitz, baietz erantzun zen. Bat ez bazen, orduan ateratzen zen harri beltza, eta Marimetik beltzantz esaten dugu. Egia esan, jatorrizkoan proiektu edo ideia baten aurkako botorik ez dela. Garai hartan, ordea, ez dakigu zer zen, baina Itun Zaharreko garaian, galdaketako pila bat erabili zuten Jainkoaren nahia zehazteko.<br/>Beraz, ikasleak hartzen ari dira gauza bera gertatzen ari den bezala, dadoak botatzen ari direla Jainkoak hautatutako bi adiskideek Judas Istor ordezkatu ahal izateko.<br/>Matiasen asko erori zen, baina zenbakituta geratu zen hamaikarekin (Eginak 1:26).<br/>Inork ez daki aurretik edo ordutik. Interesgarria izango da zein den Matias ezagutu eta nor den eta zer egin zuen jakitea. Hortik abiatuta, Paulo apostolu gisa aukeratu zuela argi eta garbi ikusten dut. Pablok bere burua adierazten du. Orain, azkeneko aldian, Jainkoaren nahia aurkitzen saiatzeari buruz irakurri dugu, zotz eginez edo gauza mota batez.<br/>Badakit lagun bat gaur, Jaunaren borondatea bereizteko nahian, otoitz egingo du eta Jauna galdera bat eskatuko dio. Hamar zakil izango ditu poltsikoan, eta berak otoitz egiten duenean, zakila bere begiekin estaliko du eta mahai gainean behera egingo du, eta denak bururatzen badira, bai. Gauza interesgarria da, behin eta behin, guztiak etortzen dira, eta hori da aukera ona. Hala ere, ez dugu aurkitzen eredurik Espiritu Santua eman ondoren. Behin Espiritu Santua heldu zenean elizara, orduan Espiritu Santua hasi zen hitz egiten eta zuzendu zen. Eta Espiritu Santuak esan zuen: “ bereizi niri Pablo eta Barnabaseri, nik deitu nien ministeriorako”. Eta Espiritu Santuak bidali zien: Beraz, aurkitu dugu Eliza Espiritu Santuaren gida gehiago, gertatu zenean Espiritu Santua, hau da, Jainkoaren nahia aurkitzeko da baztertua izan zena.<br/>+"<br/><br/>King James bertsioa<br/><br/>Hau da Biblian aipatzen den 1769ko Errege Santiagoren Bertsio Santua.

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2. Most noise cancelling headphones use the built in mic for the DSP (the noise cancelling) and to make calls so the signal from the mic needs to be able to be sent to the phone too.<br/>3. I'm not quite sure what you mean by this ...<br/><br/>Click to expand...<br/><br/>But you are correct that a headphone driver can work as a "low quality" mic. In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell-a, izar-potentziala elikatu beharrean, 750 urterekin izan nintzen eta oso gogorra da, hala, izarren potentziak benetan nagusitzen dute. Noiz i play game graba (600 tropas inguru), askotan daude partiduak non etsai taldeak gurekin baino jokalari bat gehiago du eta ez da, nahiz eta 9 vl behar dugu hori lehiatzeko. Batzuetan, talde etsaia erabat osatuta dagoen eta gutako bakarren bat ere ez diren partidak daude.Horgatik, ez da harritzekoa, are gehiago, izar marroiak jotzen ez dituzten jokalari asko bezala, eta 600 bat trofeo inguru.<br/>Editatu: Supercell-ek gutxienez oinarrizko mekanismo bat izan behar duela uste dut, partiduak sortzean batez besteko nota jasotzeko.<br/><br/>Trofeoak izan ezik, benetan zure trebetasuna adierazi behar dute.Taldearekin jokatzen ari zaren taldekideen trebetasuna adierazten dute. Eta ondo nago goi mailako kribatzaileen aurka, baina talde bat 10 mailakoa denean eta beste talde bat ez da, argi eta garbi, ez da desorekatua.<br/><br/>Lagun on batzuk lortzea gomendatzen dut, nirekin eta 2 lagun nire lagun 3 kiloko 1 kiloko muntaketa lortu dut, gamek konposizio jakin batekin jolasten, eta guk bakar bat ere egin dugu gure eskuekin.<br/><br/>Ezagutzen dut nola sentitzen nauzunek arrakala handietan jotzen nituen eta gero eta zailagoa da, eta esaten zidaten guztia "izar potentziak izan nahi dut" oso superzelularra behar da izar ahalmenetara orekatzeko edo, gutxienez, komakatzeko sistema hobea egiteko.<br/><br/>Nik hau sentitzen dut: ez naiz zuri bezain ona, baina 500 eta 500 arteko boterea lortu dut, eta partidua izugarri handia izan da. Jokalari kopurua 5-8 k-ko trofeo inguruan zela... Azken minutuan lo egin behar izan nuen jokalari aspergarriak edo, besterik gabe, agresibitate apur bat jokatu ahal izan dudalako. Baina benetan nahi dut errazagoa izan daiteke tiraderek benetan maila altua lortu nahi duten pertsonentzat izar ahalmenen luxua izan gabe.<br/><br/>Alto punta oraindik ona da kurbatu gabe. Curveball izan zen sarritan zure jaurtiketak egiteko laguntza bat izan zen, baina kurbatu aurretik ere, oso indartsua zen, beraz, orain berdina izango du.<br/><br/>Ados nago haserre izan behar zutela, baina uste dut bai sinpatia eta bai Ambush orekatzen saiatzen ari direla, biak dira aldaketa honekin bat egiten ari diren heinean. Indar apur bat bihurtu zen, baina ez nefr-benetan.<br/><br/>Ez dakit ziur hau, baina orain, Darryl-ek agerraldi nabarmena lortu zuela, bere estatistika berriak ikusita, Badirudi Darryl Bull-ek baino kalte gehiago izan ditzakeela, ez bakarrik Bull-ek, beraz, ez du denbora gehiago galduko, beraz, bere biziraupenerako antzekoa izango da izarrik gabe (nahiz eta Bull-en Hough Guy izan zuen baino askoz hobea izango da). Ez hori bakarrik, Darryl-en superaberroa berriz konpondu daiteke, esan nahi du Darryl MIT-ek modu eraginkorrean jokatu ahal izango du, bai pisu handiko ETA hilketa bat bezala (hiltzaile gisa zurrupatu baino lehen).<br/><br/>Baina berak gehiegizkoa egiten du. Eta oso erraz lortzen duzu tropasteak. Beraz, ni ni neu neu naiz, bera 500era iritsi nintzenean ere jo izan nuen (gaur egun 5 hilabete), ez dut asko axola.<br/><br/>Zergatik ez du Poco/Penny-k HP zenbakia lortzen, Marksman/Healeer hurrenez hurren tankea ez bada?<br/>Zergatik ez da Rosaren astokeria, % 70eko kalteak murriztea?<br/>Zergatik da baimenduta maila altuena eta joko osoan libreena izatea?<br/>Zergatik ez du Leonek HP/Dage buff bat lortzen?<br/><br/>Izan ere, hori izan zitekeen, Opush izan zen, ez Pepe-k, eta argudiatuko nuke Ambush-ek jokoan izar-potentziarik onena dela (nahiz eta orain gehiago kalteren portzentajea erdira igo zen) eta Piper-en oinarria beheko-10 kolpe bat zela.<br/><br/>Zer egin behar da Supercell-ak, bi nefrak kenduta, 600 eta 0,5-ra arte murriztu, oinarrizko kalteak eragin baititu zeharka.<br/><br/>Bai, eta uste dut Rosarekin pixka bat urrun joan zirela, orain zezena onena baita, une batez egon den arren, Darryl zezen txiki eta boteretsuagoa izan litekeela.<br/><br/>Zergatik? Ia dena behar duela uste dut, bere izar boterea izan ezik, bere osasuna eta abiadura pixka bat zailagoa egiten du erabiltzeko, nahiko erraz hil daitekeelako eta oso zaila baita K.a. Bere izar boterea apur bat apurtuta dago, ordea... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Auto-Enplegua 1. zatia<br/><br/>Edozein erakundetan lan egitea onartzen duzunean, hainbat lan egin behar dituzu zure langileen eskakizunen arabera, eta diru-sarrera finko bat lor dezakezu soldata gisa.
