| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Duela berrogeita bederatzi urte, Londres B. Johnson presidenteak 1965eko Voting Rights Act sinatu zuen.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Duela mende bat, 15. Konstituzioaren aldaketa, "Estatu Batuetako herritarrek bozkatzeko eskubidea ez da ukatuko edo kaltetuko, arraza, kolore edo aurretiazko egoera batean". Eta ia mende bat lehenago, gure herrialdeko guraso sortzaileek demokrazia amerikarraren esperimentu handi bat abian jartzen zuten "gizon guztiak berdinak sortzen direla" esanez.<br/><br/>1965eko Boto Eskubideei buruzko Legea Amerikan ere aitortua izan zen, gure idealek pisu txikia behar dute, legeak babesten ez baditu. Horregatik, 15. zuzenketaren 2. atalean, Kongresuak onartu zuen "artikulua indarrean jartzea lege egokiekin".<br/><br/>Egia esan, Boto-eskubidearen Legearen hizkuntza kodetua ezin izan zuena lortu ahal izan zen. 1964ko Eskubide Zibilen Legea, eta 1964ko bozkatzeko eskubideari buruzkoa, sortu ziren Eskubide Zibilen Legea, eta Estatu Batuetako beltzek prozesu demokratikoan parte hartzeko aukera izan zuten katalizatzaile gisa balio zuten.<br/><br/>Adibidez, Mississippiko beltzeko 6,7 besterik ez ziren 1962ko botoa emateko; 1969ko figura hori ehuneko 6,6koa zen. Gaur egun, Mississippik beste edozein estatuk baino funtzionario beltz gehiago ditu.<br/><br/>Boto-eskubidearen legeak ezartzen zituen babesak luzeak izan ziren igaro zirenean, borroka latzaren ordezkari gisa. Baina, zalantzarik gabe, babes horiek erasopean daude orain, gure nazioak hainbeste lan egin zuen aurrera ateratzeko.<br/><br/>Pasa den urtean, Shelby S. Holderren kasuan, Estatu Batuetako Auzitegi Gorenak bozkatzeko eskubidearen funtsezko osagaia gonbidatu zuen, botoa emateko lege berri bat indarrean jarri aurretik bereizkeriarik eza bermatzeko.<br/><br/>Publizitatea<br/><br/>Zoritxarrez, agintari errepublikarren erantzuna ez da ezer egin.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Vatikanoa garbitzailea SJ<br/><br/>2021eko ekainaren 13an<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Irudia: Migratzaile Australiakoak.<br/><br/>Erromako Unibertsitate Gregorreko Haurren Babeseko Zentroko presidentea eta Haurren Babeseko Batzorde Pontifizioko kidea, Fr Hans Zellner SJ 2018an Australian izan zen agintari katoliko eta zaintzaileekin hitz egiteko.<br/><br/>Jesusen Lagundiko Michael McVeigh-ek bere bisitan eseri zuen, Elizak nazioarte mailan nola erantzuten duen aztertzeko, eta Australiako gure esperientzietatik zer ikas dezakeen aztertzeko.<br/><br/>MMM: Hau da Australiara egingo duzun hirugarren bidaia. Beste herrialde batzuk bisitatu dituzu, elizak munduari nola erantzuten dion ikusteko.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zolner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Nire ulermena, bost edo sei kontinenteetan 50 herrialde inguru bisitatu ondoren, Elizak justiziaren gaiari buruz egindako azken bi urteetan zehar mugitzen hasten dela da, haiek entzunez eta babestearen inguruan zer egin daitekeen adieraziz.<br/><br/>Afrika osoko jesulagunen probintziekin nengoen apirilaren amaieran, eta Afrikako jesulagunen Laguntza eta Madagaskargo presidentea oso konprometituta eta dedikatuta dago. Berak jarri du ekintza-plan zehatz bat, bai formazio-plan bat, bai eta leku osoko jarraibideak aurkezteko ere. Oso ahalegin eztabaidatsua eta asmo handikoa da egin ahal izateko, Afrikako jesuitak bezala lan proaktiboan jardun ahal izateko, duela urte batzuk arte hori guztia atzerriko hizkuntza izan zen kontinente batean.<br/><br/>Ikuspegi global hori garatzeko erronketako bat zera da: hainbeste kulturaz ari zarela, eta hainbeste ulertzen ari zarela. Nola elkartzen zara eta gai horiei aurre egiteko prestakuntza eta laguntza erlijiosoak ematen saiatzen zara?<br/><br/>Hori da gure galdera nagusietako bat, uste dut egin dezaket zer egin dezaket estimulatzea, hausnarketa bultzatzea eta pertsonak prestatzea ahalik eta gehien, lan egin dezaten.<br/><br/>Virginiako Unibertsitateko Haurren Babeserako Zentroak ez du galdera guztiei erantzuten. Ez dakigulako testuinguru espezifikoak, gutxi batzuk ezagutzen ditugu, baina milaka kulturez ari gara hitz egiten, ehunka hizkuntzaz hitz egiten ari gara, oso legezko jatorriez ari gara. Batzuetan, herrialde batean ere aldatzen da, Australiakoa adibidez, non beste estatu batzuk baino lege ezberdinak dituzten Australiako Commonwealtheko estatuetan.<br/><br/>Oso pozik nago jendeari entzutearekin.<br/><br/>Gogoan izan behar dugula biktimei entzutea eta haien berri ematea. Noski, hemen Royal Commission-en izan dugu, baina zein dira beste modu batzuk biktimen ahotsa munduan zehar onartzen ari direla ikusi dutenak?<br/><br/>Frantzian, 'The Listening Space' deitzen duten diodo bat dago, biktimek aurrera egin dezakete eta beraiek adieraz dezakete. Apezpikua presente dago. Espazio irekia da, zalantzarik gabe min izan duten pertsonek Elizaren lidergotik eta abar eskatu nahi dutena adierazi dezaten.<br/><br/>Badaude beste leku batzuk AEBetan edo biktima izan duten beste herrialde batzuetan Elizbarrutietan, probintzietan, elizako buruzagiaren eskutik, aurrera egiteko. Esan behar dut, oro har, borondate ona dagoela, eta ezagutzen ditugun biktimak entzuten dituzten apezpiku eta probintzia gehiago daude. Baina ez dago inor biktimentzako eredurik, ez bakarrik espazioa adierazteko eta entzunarazteko, baizik eta aktiboki parte hartzeko Elizaren garapenean.<br/><br/>Biktimei laguntzeko guneak konfiguratzeari dagokionez, zer dira benetan lagundu dezaketen zenbait gauza, eta hemen kontuan hartu genezakeela Australian?<br/><br/>Biktim askok biktima asko ekartzen dituzten punturik handienetako bat zera da: ‘Ezin dugu parrokia-ezarpenen barruan, eskola-ezarpenen barruan, elkarrizketa arrunt bat, batzordea, soinu-batzordea, feedback-taldea edo horrelako zerbait?’ Beraz, ahots hori ez da bakarrik une jakin batean ateratzen, edo pertsona bat bezala sentitzen den, horretaz hitz egin ahal izateko, baizik eta [hitzaldi] erregular batean, sortu ahots hori sisteman.<br/><br/>Horrela, bizirik irteten direnei eta biktimei laguntza emango diegu esperientzia berezi eta bizi-erronka espezifikoetan ongi etorria eta estimatuko dutelako. Bigarrenik, komunitateari lagunduko dio, behintzat, gero eta sentsibilitate handiagoa eta sentikorragoa egin baitezakegu bizirik dauden pertsonen kezka eta premia espezifikoei, eta gazteei ere hitz egin diezaiekeenei.<br/><br/>M: Hemen bizirik atera diren talde sendoak ditugu Australian prozesu horren bidez elkarri laguntzeko gai izan direnak. Baina zer esaten ari zaren talde horiei laguntzeko eta pertsona horiei laguntzeko moduren bat behar dugula da, gure erakundeen bidez ere?<br/><br/>Sormena izan behar dugula uste dut. Ikastetxe batentzako eta eliza baterako lan egingo du, eta beste batzuentzat modu desberdinean. Izan ere, etengabeko harremanetan nagoekin bizirik atera direnek, nahiko antzeko galderak dituzte, eta antzeko esperientziak dituzte harrera ona izateko elizara edo kanpoan gelditu gabe. Baina nahiko itxaropen desberdinak dituzte beraiek ere. Beraz, ikasi dut oso gertu egon behar duzula talde zehatz honetako desberdintasunak onartzeko, edo bizirik irauteko, eskaerak eta beharrak.<br/><br/>M: Bizirik bisitariek beren istorioak entzun eta aitortu nahi dituztela hitz egiten dute, hemen Australiako Errege Batzordea dugu, biktimek aurrera egin dezaketen prozesu independente bat eskaintzen duena. Ba al dago horrelako zerbait behar duenik eliza nazioartean egia, justizia eta adiskidetze prozesu baten aurrean?<br/><br/>H: Bai, uste dut nazioarteko beharra dagoela, baina uste dut lehen tokiko eliza bakoitzak bere etxea behar duela. Ez dut ikusten oso laster gertatzen ari denik kontzilio edo batzorde hori Eliza osorako eremu horretan sartuko zela. Elizak 1.3 milioi pertsona ditu, eta 190 herrialdetan dago presente, mota guztietako desberdintasunak baitira laguntza psikologikoari, espiritualari eta finantzarioari dagokienez.<br/><br/>Badago gauza bat etengabe ari naizela komunikatzen, biktimei lan egiten eta entzutearekin, eta hori da entzuna izatea. Beraz, biktimak etengabe entzuten ari ziren sentimendua bazen — Erroma eta beste leku batzuetan— uste dut biktimentzako erliebe handi bat emango zuela.<br/><br/>Uste dut [ Frantzisko santua] kezka dagoela, batez ere zure galderari dagokionez, tokiko elizak egiten dutela, biktimen zerrenda herrialde jakin batean entzun ahal izateko. Aita Santuari hitz egin nahi dion jendearen zerrenda dut zuzenean, eta fisikoki ezinezkoa da. 2014an han egon nintzen bi preso aleman aukeratu zituzten bi irlandarrekin eta bi gazte ingelesrekin, haien seikoa etxean jaso zuenean. Goiz osoa hartu zuen entzun haiei beste baten ondoren. 40 eta 45 minutuz egon zen han, eta hori egin zuen, bizirik iraun zuen bakoitzeko.<br/><br/>Bere eredua Eliza Katolikoaren eredu izan da, bizirik zirautenak, ongi etorriak eta entzunak. Uste dut munduko apezpikuak eta probintziak, herrialde guztietan, bizirik irauteko ereduari jarraitzen badiote.<br/><br/>artzapezpiku Dianmud Martin familia-bilerak baino askoz lehenago aipatzen zen, Batzorde Pontifikalari buruz, gaur egun oso txikia dela esanez zer behar den lortzeko. Elizak baliabide gehiago jarri behar al ditu gai horiek gainbegiratzeko?<br/><br/>Une honetan kontinente guztietako 16 kide gara, eta hizkuntza talde nagusiak. Dizipulu eta lanbide ugari irudikatzen ditugu, eta batzordearen helburua, aldarrikatu berri diren estatutuak bezala, Aita Santuari aholku ematea da.<br/><br/>Komisioari buruzko desadostasun komun bat da, lehenik eta behin, jazarpena kasuei aurre egiten diegula, eta hori ez da horrela. Ez dugu eskumen juridiko edo administratiborik kasuetarako, auzitegiei eta prozedura okerrei dagokienez.<br/><br/>Bigarren antzuketa bat da sustatzen dugula, zuzenean gauzak lurrean. Gure lehenengo helburua Aita Santua gaitzen dugula da.<br/><br/>Beraz, nire ikuspuntutik, bai, gehiago inbertitu behar dugu. Baina tokiko mailan gehiago inbertitu behar dugu, eta ziurtatu behar dugu Batzorde Pontifikalaren proposamenak Aita Santuari helarazi dizkiogula, normalean Presidenteari egiten diona, eta, ondoren, gure aholku gisa eman duguna islatzen duen jarraipena egin behar dugula.<br/><br/>Australian, Elizaren erantzuna zaintzen ari da, eta elizako erakunde guztiak haurren erakunde seguruak direla bermatzeko jarraibideak eta laguntzak ematen ditu. Beharrezkoa al da zenbait erakunde-laguntza behar Erromatik erakunde horiek eratu eta zentsuratzen ari diren gotzainentzat?<br/><br/>Nik uste dut azkenean lerro horretan garatuko dela, eta orain arlo horietan adituak kontratatzeko prozesuan daude.<br/><br/>Elizak elkarren artean ikas dezakeela ulertu behar dut, eta nire ulermena beti izan da, eta nik uste dut Aita Santuak gogorarazi digu, elizak ez duela enpresa zentralizatu gisa funtzionatuko. Ez du horrela lan egiten, modu eraginkorrean. gotzain guztiek dute, neurri batean, bizitza bere kabuz, zer gehiago ikasi behar dugu elkarrekiko komunikazio bideak irekiz.<br/><br/>Elizan tratu txarrak salatzen dituzten hainbat gauza daude. Apaiz eta psikologo gisa, eta bizirik atera diren pertsona gisa, zein dira zure pentsamenduak?<br/><br/>Uste dut non gertatzen den gehiegikeria da garrantzitsuena, eta Aita Santuari bidali dio bere gutunean argitaratua dagoen abuztuaren 20an. Lehen atalean esaten du, eta berriro errepikatzen du, sexu-abusuaren auzia beti lotuta dagoela, edo ia beti ere boterearen gehiegikeriaren galderari lotuta dagoela, baina baita kontzientziaren gehiegikeriari ere.<br/><br/>Beraz, gehiegikeriaren benetako galdera da sexualitatea baino konplexuagoa - heterosexuala edo homosexuala izan. Botere bat da, eta benetan landu behar dugu nola ulertzen dugun apaizgoaren nola ulertzen dugun, nola ulertzen dugu eta nola bizitzen ditugun gure ministerioak? Zer dira mugak?<br/><br/>Horregatik oso pozik nago Australiako Jesuiten Probintziak Jokabide Kodea ezartzen duela, ez baitugu soilik adingabeei sexu-abusuei buruz hitz egiten. Helduen sexu-abusuei buruz hitz egiten dugu, eta beste modu batzuetan buruz hitz egiten dugu: kontzientzia-abusuak, pentsatzen duzunari buruz, edo Jainkoa ezagutzeari buruz pentsatzen duzunari buruz, eta beste pertsona bati esan diezaiokezu: ‘Ba egin behar duzu, pertsona horren kontzientziaren aurka’.<br/><br/>Jende askok uste du klimatologiak gehiegikeriak eragiten dituela. Beti esaten dudan bezala, ospetsuek ez dute gehiegikeriarik eragiten. Beste modu batera esanda, nola azaltzen dugu abusa guztien ehuneko 99,9 ez dela bizitza ospakizun bat, eta nola azaltzen dugu 95 edo 96 agian ez dutela adin txikikoak gehiegikeriarik? Baina, bai, zeliatasuna edo baikortasunaren aldeko apustua, ez da benetan integratzen, hori ez da benetan behar bezala bizitzen – bai, horrek arazo bat sortzen du. Batzuetan jendeak edaten du, batzuetan jokoa hartzen dute, eta batzuetan sexu eroaten dute, helduekin eta adingabeekin.<br/><br/>Horren benetako galdera da nola jorratzen dugun botere espiritual erlijiosoaren nozioa, zeinekin presoak eta apezpikuak inbertitzen diren? Nola lagun gaitzake teologiak ulertzen, eta agian, nola lagun diezagukeen soziologia, psikologia edo enpresa-administrazioak potentzia-mugak zehazten, eta zure mugak mantentzeko beharra |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Izan ere, orain arte joango nintzateke hau ez dela inoiz aldatuko den zerbait, eta denok asmatu beharko genuke aldaketaz. 10 urterekin, gure gastuaren zatirik garrantzitsuenak izango dira oraindik ere, kontzeptu konplexuak kezkarik handieneko zerrendan, eta azkenean ulertzen ari garen gauzak izango dira.<br/><br/>Orain, Gunnarek eta Andyk puntu bikainak dituzte, ITko taldeek arazoak ikusten dituzte eta soluzio informatikoak konpontzen dituzte; hain zuzen ere, positiboki meritua daukate.<br/><br/>Baina uste dut beste ideia batzuk daudela egia esaten dutenak (horiei buruz hitz egin nuen eta gero blogari buruz erabaki behar nuen). 3 kezka nagusiak hauek dira:<br/><br/>gauza berriak beldur gara ulertzen ez ditugunez, edo ez dute ulertzen berriak direlako.<br/><br/>Guretzat ere ikuspegi sendoak ditugu horiek manipulatzeko.<br/><br/>Gehiegik dira guretzat kezkatuta egon beharko bagenu edo ez! Desfiguratu nahi dugu paranotikoa/kongurtzea, ona baita!<br/><br/>haiei esleitutako aurrekontuen ageriko elementuak ere erosi ahal ditut. "cloud segurtasuna" edo " sare sozialetako segurtasuna" eskaintzen duen kutxa edo software bat erosi al dezaket?<br/><br/>Negozio berriak dira, beraz, ez dakite nola erabili edo zer nahi duten, bakarrik nola seguru egon gaitezke oraindik bilera bat egiten ari garen bitartean edo, gutxienez, negozioaren behar guztiak betetzen ez dituen bitartean. Negozioak oraindik erabiltzen ez baditu ere, ez naiz ziur nago segurtasun-egoera erabilera hori modu seguruan gidatzeko.<br/><br/>Aipatu beharra dago, halaber, gauza berri horiek asko bultzatzen ari direla kontsumitzaile eta negozioan, IT gisa "Oh yeah, pentsatzaile" gisa. Suteak, AAV, AAM, Auh, IT erantzun guztiak dira normalean. Noski, desberdintasuna dago. Oso gai subjektiboak dira, su-etenaren, ohitura maltzurren, jokabideen, sinaduraren, portuen eta abarren aurrean. Negozioak arazo oso konplexuak aurkezten ditu askotan jendearekin (paratu ezin duguna) zerikusia dutenak eta sarritan ez dutenak arau lodietan sartzen. Irtenbide teknikoetatik urrundu bagara ere, eta arazo horiek konpontzen saiatu bagara ere, oraindik ez dira ondo konpontzen.Gainera, botatzerakoan, su-etenekin lor ditzakezu helburuak?Beraz, hobetu al dezakezu? Hori guztia arazo horien alderdi subjektiboak ez diren alderdietatik abiatzen da.Haurren txosten-txartel baten eta guraso-irakasle baten iritziaren arteko diferentziaren zerrenda. Haur bat baldin baduzu, zeinekin zerikusirik ez duen edo behar den moduan jokatuko zenuke? ( Erantzuna subjektiboa da!)<br/><br/>Esan daiteke segurtasun eta teknologiaren aurrerapen naturala dela: kontrol teknikoak ekarri, metaketara eta pertsonak mugiaraztera. Ziur, 3 kezka nagusiak firewall-en eta sareko segmentuen bidez zulatzea esan daitezke, baina gauza horien izaera (sare sozialen bidez "koponketa" baino askoz desberdina da SSH konexioa erabiliz nire etxeko sarera; sare sozialak atzealdean* erabiltzen dut SSH konexioa jadanik behar delako; hau da, sare sozialak 80 ataka erabiltzen du).<br/><br/>Funtsean, dikotomia hori ez da harritzekoa, eta ez dut uste are gehiago oker dagoela IT/segurtasun hori, ezta negozioak behar bezala lerrokatuta ere, edo zerbitzarien gela tekniko bat duela. Ez dut esaten gauzak ondo egiten ari garela, edo behar bezala lerrokatuta gaudela, baina goikoa ez da argudio ona gabezia horien teoriari laguntzeko.<br/><br/>Orain, benetan jauzi handia egiteko, mugikorreko konputazioaren egungo hazkundea negoziora iristea gustatuko litzaidake eta gero PC/Interneta negoziora gehitzea. Orain, lehen gertatu zenean ez nintzen inguruan, eta industrian nengoen informatikaren iraultza pertsonala negozio bihurtu zenean, baina orain arte hain ohikoa ez zen hori, esan dezaket gizarte-sareetarako gauza bera ere. Hauek berri madarikatuak dira eta aldaketa handiak dira Mac-en edo software berrietan edo negozio-prozesu berri batzuetan soilik. |
