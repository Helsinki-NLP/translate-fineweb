| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Das historische Viertel Leclaire, das einst als Edwardsvilles "Vorstadt im Süden" bezeichnet wurde, wurde 1890 als Genossenschaft gegründet und blieb ein separates Dorf, bis es 1934 an die Stadt Edwardsville angegliedert wurde. Zeitungen und Zeitschriften in den Vereinigten Staaten und Europa berichteten über das Leclaire-Experiment, insbesondere in den ersten 20 Jahren seines Bestehens. 1979 wurde das ehemalige Dorf aufgrund seiner einzigartigen Geschichte in das National Register of Historic Places aufgenommen.<br/><br/>Leclaire wurde von Nelson Oliver Nelson gegründet, einem Sanitärhersteller aus St. Louis, der viele Jahre lang die Not der Arbeiterklasse fördern wollte. Nelson wollte die Arbeitsbedingungen für seine Mitarbeiter verbessern und Unterkünfte in der Nähe der Fabriken bereitstellen, damit die Arbeiter und ihre Familien leicht an Freizeit- und Bildungsprogrammen teilnehmen können, die von der Firma kostenlos angeboten werden. Vor 1890, während noch in St. Louis, begann die N. O. Nelson Company Herstellung und Vertrieb Unternehmen mit Gewinnbeteiligung zusammen mit Bildungs- und Freizeitmöglichkeiten. Das kooperative Experiment Leclaire würde zusätzliche Vorteile bringen.<br/><br/>Als die Mitarbeiter von Nelson ankündigten, dass sie an einen ländlichen Standort umziehen wollten, wandten sich Unternehmensvertreter an die Führer von Kleinstädten in mehreren Gemeinden in Missouri und Illinois in der Nähe ihres Hauptsitzes in St. Louis. Sie suchten nach einem geeigneten Grundstück, um neue Fabriken und ein Modelldorf zu bauen. Südlich von Edwardsville fanden sie ein 125 Hektar großes Grundstück mit Zugang zu Wasser, Kohle und Transport. Lokale Geschäftsleute reagierten schnell, um einen finanziellen Anreiz zu bieten. In weniger als drei Wochen sammelte die Gemeinde einen Fonds von 20.000 US-Dollar aus einzelnen Beiträgen zwischen 1 und 1.000 US-Dollar, um Nelson dazu zu bringen, Edwardsville für sein Unternehmen zu wählen.<br/><br/>Die Stadtführer hatten gehofft, Immobilien innerhalb der Stadtgrenzen von Edwardsville zu finden, aber als kein geeigneter Standort gefunden werden konnte, waren sie zuversichtlich, dass die Nelson-Investition südlich der Stadt bald ein Teil von Edwardsville werden würde. Obwohl Nelson in seinem Vertrag alle Voraussetzungen für den Bau und die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen erfüllte, dauerte es 44 Jahre bis zur Annexion an Edwardsville. Leclaire, begrenzt von Madison / Brown Avenues im Osten, die Eisenbahngleise im Westen, Hadley / McKinley Avenues im Süden und Wolf Street im Norden, blieb ein unabhängiges Dorf von 1890 bis 1934. In dieser Zeit erwarb es sich einen Ruf für Innovationen in den Bereichen Wirtschaft, Bildung und Wohnplanung.<br/><br/>Das Dorf Leclaire auf einer Karte von Edwardsville von 1931<br/>Mit freundlicher Genehmigung von Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsons Entscheidung, ein Dorf zu bauen, wurde nicht aus einer Laune heraus getroffen. In den späten 1880er Jahren war er ein internationaler Führer in den Bereichen Zusammenarbeit und Gewinnbeteiligung. Er tauschte soziale Theorien mit anderen auf der ganzen Welt aus, während er sein Geschäft in St. Louis ausbaute. Er benannte sein experimentelles Dorf nach dem Pariser Profit-Sharer Edme Jean Leclaire, aber er besuchte viele andere soziale Visionäre, die Informationen und Inspiration lieferten. Die besten Ideen aus diesen Beispielen zusammenstellend, gründete Nelson Leclaire, um, in seinen Wörtern, "Arbeit zu geben, Intelligenz zu fördern, Erholung zur Verfügung zu stellen, Schönheit zu fördern, und Häuser zu machen." Spätere Schriftsteller verwendeten diese Worte, um Leclaires Gründungsprinzipien zu formulieren: Arbeit, Häuser, Bildung, Erholung und Schönheit, aber mit dem zusätzlichen wichtigen Prinzip der Freiheit.<br/><br/>Arbeit<br/><br/>Arbeit könnte als der wichtigste dieser Faktoren angesehen werden, denn ohne die Fabrikjobs in Leclaire gäbe es kein Dorf. Die Backsteinfabrikgebäude wurden vom Architekten E. A. Cameron entworfen, um natürliches Licht, Belüftung im Sommer und beheizte Böden im Winter zu bieten. Es gab ein Brandbekämpfungssystem, und obwohl Arbeitsunfälle nicht beseitigt wurden, wurden alle Anstrengungen unternommen, um die Sicherheit der Arbeiter zu gewährleisten. Die mit Efeu bedeckten Backsteingebäude waren von gepflegten Rasenflächen und Blumengärten umgeben, die dem Komplex ein Campus-ähnliches Aussehen verliehen. 1894 nannte die New Yorker Reporterin Nellie Bly die Gebäude "die ideale Perfektion von Gebäuden, in denen der Mensch arbeiten kann".<br/><br/>Der Produktionskomplex der N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>Freunde von Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson Unternehmensrichtlinien wurden entwickelt, um die finanzielle Stabilität der Mitarbeiter zu schützen. Arbeitnehmer könnten einen Teil der Gewinne verdienen und eine Stimme im Unternehmen haben, wenn sie diese Option wählen. Der Gewinnbeteiligungsplan gab Nelson-Mitarbeitern einen Stolz auf das Eigentum, der zu einer unterstützenden Belegschaft führte. Es gab im Laufe der Jahre einige kurzlebige Arbeitsstreiks, aber in den meisten Fällen waren Arbeitsprobleme selten. Es gab einen Vorsorgefonds, der Renten und Krankenstand sowie Witwenrenten für den Fall des Todes eines Arbeitnehmers vorsieht, unabhängig davon, ob der Tod mit seiner Beschäftigung zusammenhängt oder nicht.<br/><br/>Der Firmensitz der N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) blieb in St. Louis, aber die gesamte N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company wurde nach Leclaire verlegt. Die Produktionsfirma wurde in Geschäfte unterteilt, die eine Vielzahl von Produkten herstellten. Im Jahr 1900 wurden die Geschäfte zu unabhängigen Unternehmen für Steuerzwecke, aber alle waren immer noch im Besitz der N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Die Geschäfte umfassten die Kabinettmühle, in der Holzprodukte von Schränken bis hin zu Mühlen hergestellt wurden. Die erfahrenen Handwerker, die hier arbeiteten, erfüllten auch spezielle Verträge, darunter Kassenkäfige für eine lokale Bank und einen Altar, der noch in der St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville verwendet wird. Der Marble Shop spezialisierte sich auf architektonischen Marmor, der von Nelson-Crews in Häusern, Geschäften und sogar in Staatskapitolen im gesamten Mittleren Westen geschnitten und installiert wurde. Die Machine Shop, die Bignall und Keeler wurde, machte Rohrfitting-Maschinen, Pumpen, Messgeräte und verschiedene mechanische Werkzeuge in der Sanitärbranche erwartet. Sie verzweigt auch Spezialitäten wie das Leclaire Fahrrad in der Mitte der 1890er Jahre zu produzieren. Die Brass Shop umfasste eine Gießerei, in der verschiedene Rohrleitungen und Werkzeuge hergestellt wurden. Diese Beispiele stellen nur einen Teil der Arbeit dar, die in den Leclaire-Werken geleistet wurde. Das Logo des Unternehmens war eine stilisierte "NONCO", die noch heute auf Sanitärarmaturen und einigen Hydranten in Edwardsville zu sehen ist.<br/><br/>Wohnungen<br/><br/>Bevor Häuser gebaut werden konnten, wurden Wohnungen für Arbeiter benötigt, die die Fabrikgebäude fertigstellten und Häuser bauten. Um diese Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen, baute das Unternehmen das "Clubhaus", ein großes Gebäude, das vielen Zwecken diente. Neben der Unterbringung war es das erste Bildungsgebäude der Gemeinde und enthielt eine gut sortierte Bibliothek.<br/><br/>Der Bau des Wohngebiets von Leclaire begann unmittelbar nach der Gründung des Dorfes im Juni 1890. Julius Pitzman, der innovative Landschaftsarchitekt, der die ersten Grundstücke in Leclaire angelegt hat, hat sie mit einer Reihe von Schutzbündnissen eingerichtet. Die Bündnisse sahen breite, kurvenförmige Straßen, große Grundstücke und eine Deed-Beschränkung vor, die die Immobilien nur auf Wohn- oder Bildungszwecke beschränkte. Das Unternehmen pflasterte die Straßen, lieferte elektrische Straßenlaternen, installierte Gehwege und pflanzte Hunderte von Bäumen entlang der Straßen von Leclaire. Spätere Abschnitte von Leclaire wurden mit einem herkömmlichen Gitterdesign und kleineren Losen ausgelegt, enthielten jedoch immer noch die Tatbeschränkungen.<br/><br/>Ein viktorianisches Ferienhaus in Leclaire im Jahr 1907<br/>von Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Anfangs wurden die Häuser von der Firma gebaut und dann zu fast Kosten an Nelson-Mitarbeiter verkauft, um den Eigenheimbesitz zu fördern. Wenn ein Arbeiter krank wurde und seine Hypothek nicht machen konnte, wurden die Zahlungen bis nach seiner Rückkehr an die Arbeit ausgesetzt. Die Häuser wurden in einer Vielzahl von Hausdesigns angeboten, und das Unternehmen gab an, dass keine zwei Wohnungen gleich waren. Die frühesten Häuser waren in erster Linie viktorianische Cottages, die mit Strom und fließendem Wasser kamen. Es folgten Bungalows, Foursquares und sogar einige Kit-Häuser. Die Bewohner konnten ein vom Unternehmen gebautes Haus kaufen oder ein leeres Grundstück kaufen und selbst ein Haus bauen, sofern das architektonische Design den Unternehmensstandards entsprach.<br/><br/>In späteren Jahren wurden Grundstücke an Investoren verkauft, in der Regel Einwohner von Edwardsville, und viele Häuser in den 1920er Jahren wurden von lokalen Auftragnehmern gebaut, die sie dann an Gebietsbewohner verkauften.<br/><br/>Bildung<br/><br/>Nelson glaubte an Bildung für alle, auch für die Arbeiterklasse. Das Bildungsprogramm begann 1892 mit einem Kindergarten im Clubhaus und setzte sich im neuen Bildungsgebäude an der 722 Holyoake Road fort. Dieses Gebäude, das gemeinhin als "Schulhaus" bezeichnet wird, bot einen großen Saal für Tagungen und Programme, hatte jedoch bewegliche Trennwände, um es tagsüber in den Klassenraum zu unterteilen. Abends gab es Tänze, Treffen oder Programme des Leclaire Self-Culture Club, die wöchentliche Vorträge von Professoren der Washington University oder national bekannten Rednern enthielten, die wie N. O. Nelson zur Jahrhundertwende Teil der sozialen Verbesserungsbewegung waren. Dazu gehörten Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones und die Autorin Charlotte Perkins Gilman.<br/><br/>Kinder, die 1913 in den Kindergarten von Leclaire aufgenommen wurden<br/>von Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In den zehn Jahren nach dem Bau des Bildungsgebäudes von 1895 gab es eine Reihe von Bildungsexperimenten, darunter eine Industrieschule, ein College, eine Nachtschule und eine Akademie. Das früheste und langlebigste Unterfangen war der 1892 gegründete Morgenkindergarten, der das Fröbel-Modell verwendete. Dieses zweijährige Programm war für alle kostenlos, einschließlich der Kinder von Edwardsville, bis 1931, als das Unternehmen aus finanziellen Gründen begann, Studenten, die nicht die Kinder von Mitarbeitern waren, Unterricht zu berechnen. Nelson Manufacturing betrieb einen Kindergarten bis 1934, als das Gebäude gegen eine geringe Gebühr an den Edwardsville School District übergeben wurde.<br/><br/>Erholung<br/><br/>Bootsfahrer am Leclaire See 1915<br/>von Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Erholung war ein wichtiges Merkmal von Leclaire. Das Unternehmen stellte Sportanlagen für Baseball, Tennis und später Fußball zur Verfügung. Eine Bowling- und Billardhalle wurde gebaut und im Winter gab es einen See zum Bootfahren, Schwimmen, Angeln oder Eislaufen. Leclaire Park wurde mit Bootshäusern, männlichen und weiblichen Badehäusern und einem großen Pavillon ausgestattet. Die Bewohner organisierten Tänze, Heuschnupfen, Bienen und andere Aktivitäten, und die Firma sponserte eine Band, die regelmäßig bei Unterhaltungen im Dorf oder in Edwardsville spielte. Wie die pädagogischen Funktionen im Clubhaus und Schulhaus, waren die Freizeiteinrichtungen in Leclaire für alle offen und waren oft ein Ziel für Edwardsville und sogar St. Louis Besucher.<br/><br/>Schönheit<br/><br/>Frühes Foto von Leclaire Lake<br/>von Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Der letzte Faktor, den Nelson für ein befriedigendes Leben für wichtig hielt, betraf die Umwelt. Nelson wusste um die Bedeutung eines gesunden Lebens. Er schätzte die Schönheit und Sauberkeit, die auf dem Land zu finden war, und ermutigte alle in Leclaire, ihr Eigentum durch das Pflanzen von Gärten und Obstgärten zu verschönern. Nelson selbst führte mit gutem Beispiel voran, so dass ein Firmengewächshaus kostenlose Blumen zur Verfügung stellte und Wettbewerbe für die schönsten Höfe veranstaltet wurden. Leclaire wurde so angelegt, dass das gesamte Dorf eine parkähnliche Umgebung hatte, die heute noch sichtbar ist.<br/><br/>Freiheit<br/><br/>Der Leclaire Cooperative Store<br/>von Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listete fünf Gründungsprinzipien für Leclaire auf, aber moderne Autoren fügen ein Sechstel hinzu: Freiheit. Alle von dem Unternehmen angebotenen Programme standen sowohl Mitarbeitern als auch Anwohnern zur Verfügung, aber keine waren obligatorisch. Die Freiheit zu entscheiden, ob sie an Firmenprogrammen teilnehmen oder nicht, lag ganz bei den einzelnen. Die Bewohner von Leclaire konnten für Nelson Manufacturing oder anderswo arbeiten, und die Arbeiter waren nicht verpflichtet, in Leclaire zu leben. Die Teilnahme an Freizeit- und Bildungsprogrammen war ebenfalls optional. Es gab auch ein Firmengeschäft, in dem die Mitarbeiter einkaufen konnten, aber im Gegensatz zu anderen Firmenstädten war niemand an das Firmengeschäft verschuldet. Der Leclaire Store war eine Genossenschaft, in der den Mitgliedern faire Marktpreise berechnet wurden, die dann aber vierteljährlich ausgezahlt wurden.<br/><br/>Eine andere Firmenstadt<br/><br/>All diese Vorteile machten Leclaire einzigartig in anderen Unternehmensstädten, aber es gab auch Einzelfälle, in denen das Unternehmen Mitgefühl und Fürsorge für die Mitarbeiter zeigte. Das Unternehmen schloss die Fabriken und mietete Ausflugszüge, um Arbeiter und ihre Familien für einen Tag auf der St. Louis World's Fair 1904 nach St. Louis zu bringen. Wenn das Geld knapp war, legte Nelson gelegentlich zusätzliches Geld in jeden Lohnumschlag, um den Arbeitern das Leben zu erleichtern, und wenn er ein Programm einführte, mit dem die Männer nicht einverstanden waren, sprachen sie es aus und so oft wie nicht, würde Nelson sich umdrehen.<br/><br/>Geboren 1841 in Lillesand, Norwegen, war N. O. Nelson ein komplizierter Mann. Er war ein Kapitalist, der an freies Unternehmertum glaubte, aber auch ein Sozialist, ein Anhänger der "Goldenen Regel" und ein Patriot, der für die Union im Bürgerkrieg diente. Um 1900 war er Multimillionär, aber bis zu seinem Tod 1922 hatte er alles für die Verbesserung der Arbeiterklasse verschenkt.<br/><br/>Obwohl Leclaire nicht Nelsons einziges soziales Experiment war, gilt es als sein erfolgreichstes Unterfangen. Andere Hauptanstrengungen für die soziale Verbesserung waren eine Kette von kooperativen Lebensmittelgeschäften in New Orleans, ein Kindergarten für die Kinder von schwarzen Angestellten in seinem Bessemer, Alabama, Fabriken, und ein Haus für Verbrauchsgüter in Indio, Kalifornien.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire war international als bemerkenswertes und erfolgreiches Experiment bekannt. Es wurde in der New Yorker Welt bei zahlreichen Gelegenheiten beschrieben, aber insbesondere von der Reporterin Nellie Bly im Jahr 1894, die ausführlich über die Modellstadt schrieb, in der "die Arbeitsfrage gelöst ist und alle in einem kleinen Dorf in der Nähe von St. Louis glücklich sind." Die Los Angeles Times berichtete auch regelmäßig über N. O. Nelson, ebenso wie die Chicago Daily Tribune und zahlreiche andere Publikationen.<br/><br/>In einer Rede auf Leclaires 15-jähriges Jubiläum im Jahr 1915 sagte Nelson: "Leclaire erstreckt sich auf Sie eine weit offene Gastfreundschaft und bietet Ihnen heute die Leichtigkeit und den Komfort und die Schönheit und Inspiration, die wir jeden Tag genießen." Seit diesem Tag ist mehr als ein Jahrhundert vergangen, aber die Einladung steht immer noch. Bewohner und Forscher sind eingeladen, etwas über Leclaires Geschichte zu erfahren und die Lehren zu ziehen, die für die Verbesserung zukünftiger Generationen gelernt werden könnten.<br/><br/>Eines der ehemaligen Gebäude des Produktionskomplexes im Jahr 2019, das jetzt als N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autorenbesuche via Zoom oder Skype<br/><br/>Skype ist eine großartige option für schulen / klassen, die keine persönlichen autoren mitbringen, aber bücher und poesie erkunden, sich mit einem autor verbinden und fragen stellen möchten.<br/><br/>Kosten<br/><br/>Ich biete 30-45-minütige Zoom- oder Skype-Besuche mit Schulen für 125 US-Dollar pro Sitzung an (oder 200 US-Dollar für zwei Sitzungen innerhalb von drei Stunden am Morgen oder Nachmittag; 325 US-Dollar für drei Sitzungen an einem Tag; 425 US-Dollar für vier Sitzungen an einem Tag). In jeder Sitzung versuche ich, Kinder so aktiv wie möglich einzubeziehen. Nein, es ist nicht die gleiche Art von Verbindung wie ein persönlicher Besuch bietet, aber es kann immer noch inspirierend und motivierend für Kinder sein!<br/><br/>Was ich mache<br/><br/>Jede Sitzung für bis zu 50 Schüler beinhaltet:<br/><br/>5 Minuten Tech-Setup<br/><br/>3 Segmente zu je 10 Minuten — Sie wählen aus:<br/><br/>Wie ich Schriftsteller wurde<br/><br/>Schreiben Sie dieses Buch (Sie wählen, auf welches Buch ich mich konzentriere)<br/><br/>Lesen (Ich lese einige Gedichte und Kinder helfen mir, andere zu lesen)<br/><br/>Klassenzimmer Präsentation (Ihre Schüler setzen auf eine Lesung oder Leistung für mich - ein sehr dankbares Publikum!)<br/><br/>Gemeinsam ein Gedicht schreiben<br/><br/>Frage- und Antwortsitzung<br/><br/>5 Minuten Wrap-ups/Auf Wiedersehen<br/><br/>Ich chatte auch mit Klassen von Pre-Service-Lehrern oder Gruppen von In-Service-Lehrern über Poesie und Schreiben.<br/><br/>Tipps für einen virtuellen Besuch<br/><br/>Tipps für einen erfolgreichen virtuellen Besuch<br/><br/>Eines meiner Ziele für virtuelle Schulbesuche ist es, die Interaktivität zu erfassen, die persönliche Besuche erfolgreich und unterhaltsam macht. Aber die Wahrheit ist, dass es manchmal schwierig ist, virtuell interaktiv zu sein! Das Timing ist möglicherweise nicht korrekt synchronisiert, was das gemeinsame Lesen zu einer Herausforderung macht, und es ist wirklich schwierig für mich, einzelne Schüler zu hören, es sei denn, sie kommen und sprechen direkt in das Mikrofon / den Computer. Aber nach einigen Versuchen und Fehlern habe ich einige Möglichkeiten entdeckt, die besten virtuellen Besuche möglich zu machen. Hier sind sie: 10 Möglichkeiten, meinen Besuch mit Ihren Schülern zu einem großartigen Erlebnis zu machen!<br/><br/>Vor dem Besuch<br/><br/>Holen Sie sich Kinder so aufgeregt wie möglich über den Besuch. Besuchen Sie meine Website mit ihnen. Lesen Sie einige meiner Bücher mit ihnen. Sammeln Sie einige Fragen Studenten für mich haben. Alles, was Sie im Voraus tun, damit es sich wie ein großer Deal anfühlt, wird einen langen Weg in Richtung Studentenengagement gehen.<br/><br/>Positionieren Sie die Videokamera oder den Laptop mit einer Webcam, damit ich so viel wie möglich vom Publikum sehen kann. Es ist schwer, das Engagement der Schüler zu beurteilen, wenn ich nur ein paar Schüler sehen kann.<br/><br/>Beschränken Sie jede Gruppe auf 50 Schüler. Es ist unglaublich schwer, große Gruppen per Video zu engagieren.<br/><br/>Ich werde mich schnell von Thema zu Thema oder Gedicht zu Gedicht bewegen. Bitte erinnern Sie die Schüler daran, dass sie genau zuhören müssen, um zu verstehen, was vor sich geht.<br/><br/>Gelegentlich mache ich ein kleines Reader's Theater mit Studenten. Wenn ich Ihnen irgendwelche geschriebenen Studententeile vor der Zeit schicke, drucken Sie eine Kopie für JEDE Sitzung und schneiden Sie sie bei Bedarf in Stücke.<br/><br/>Während des Besuchs<br/><br/>Wenn ich ein Buch bespreche, wenn Sie dieses gedruckte Buch haben, halten Sie es bitte für die Schüler bereit.<br/><br/>Du bist mein Stellvertreter. Ich kann die Schüler oft nicht anrufen und keine individuellen Antworten hören. Also könnte ich sagen: "Wir werden 3 Ideen bekommen. Heben Sie Ihre Hand, wenn Sie eine Idee haben." Dann übernehmen SIE, rufen drei Studenten an und geben diese Antworten an alle im Raum und an mich weiter.<br/><br/>Wählen Sie selbstbewusste, ausgehende Schüler für skriptgesteuerte Schülerteile (wenn ich sie im Voraus sende). Während meiner persönlichen Schulbesuche versuche ich, einige der weniger selbstbewussten Schüler herauszuziehen, aber ich habe festgestellt, dass dies bei virtuellen Besuchen nicht so gut funktioniert, weil ich sie nicht hören kann.<br/><br/>Lassen Sie die Schüler mit Sprechanteilen vorne sitzen. Wenn es Zeit ist, lassen Sie sie aufstehen und sie daran erinnern, laut zu sprechen.<br/><br/>Bei virtuellen Besuchen fällt das Verhaltensmanagement allein auf Sie. Ich kann oft nicht genau sehen, was vor sich geht, also treten Sie bitte bei Bedarf ein. Wenn es eine große Störung gibt, bitte mich einfach, mich für einen Moment festzuhalten, damit ich nicht plaudere, während niemand aufpasst:>)<br/><br/>Fühlen sie sich frei, fotos von mir auf dem bildschirm zu machen und in sozialen medien zu teilen - auch wenn bilder von mir oft lächerlich aussehen, weil ich lustige gesichter oder so etwas mache, während ich lese.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie Fragen haben, fragen Sie bitte vor oder während des Besuchs!<br/><br/>Planung einer virtuellen Sitzung<br/><br/>Sind Sie daran interessiert, einen virtuellen Besuch mit mir zu planen? Senden Sie mir einfach eine E-Mail, um ein Datum einzurichten, und wir gehen von dort aus |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | News Archiv<br/><br/>Neues Buch untersucht Möglichkeiten, HIV-Herausforderungen anzugehen<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis mit Marjorie Human, die das Cover des Buches Acting on HIV entworfen hat.<br/><br/>Die HIV-Pandemie hat die besten und schlechtesten Menschen in Bezug auf die Reaktion gebracht.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Immobilien-Wort des Tages: Option<br/><br/>Option: Eine Vereinbarung, für einen bestimmten Zeitraum ein Angebot zum Verkauf oder zur Vermietung von Immobilien offen zu halten. Eine Option kann beispielsweise verwendet werden, um dem Käufer Zeit zu geben, um Fragen der Finanzierung, des Titels, der Zoneneinteilung und der Machbarkeit zu lösen, bevor der Käufer zum Kauf verpflichtet wird. Die Option muss durch ihre tatsächliche Berücksichtigung unterstützt werden, getrennt und unabhängig vom Kaufpreis der Immobilie. Die bloße Erwägung der Gegenleistung allein reicht nicht aus, es sei denn, es handelt sich um eine Leasingoption, bei der die Bestimmungen des Leasingverhältnisses selbst ausreichend berücksichtigt werden, um die Option zu unterstützen. Eine Option schafft lediglich ein vertragliches Recht; sie gibt dem Optionsnehmer keinen Nachlass in der Immobilie. Zum Zeitpunkt der Unterzeichnung der Option verkauft der Eigentümer die Immobilie nicht und kauft sie auch nicht. Obwohl der Eigentümer verpflichtet ist, zu verkaufen, wenn er vom Käufer benachrichtigt wird, ist der Käufer nicht zum Kauf verpflichtet. Eine Kaufoption wird auch als Anruf bezeichnet. Eine Verkaufsoption wird als Put bezeichnet. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Vorteile von Carotinoiden für die Haut<br/><br/>Haben Sie schon von Carotinoiden gehört? Diese starken Phytochemikalien sind die pigmentierten Bestandteile in Pflanzen, die Blumen, Früchte und Blätter in ihren gelben, orangen und roten Farben enthalten.<br/><br/>Seit den 1930er Jahren haben Wissenschaftler etwa 800 Carotinoide identifiziert und etwa 40 befinden sich im menschlichen Körper, einschließlich der äußersten Schicht der Epidermis, der Dermis und des subkutanen Fettgewebes. Die häufigsten Carotinoide sind Beta-Carotin, Alpha-Carotin, Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Lycopin und Astaxanthin. Hier können Sie mehr über Astaxanthin lesen.<br/><br/>Der Gehalt an Carotinoiden in der Haut wird durch zahlreiche Faktoren beeinflusst, darunter die Aufnahme von Obst und Gemüse, ihre Bioverfügbarkeit aus verschiedenen Lebensmitteln, Nahrungsergänzung, UV-Strahlung, Luftverschmutzung, Alkoholkonsum, Rauchen und Stress.<br/><br/>Wie helfen Carotinoide meiner Haut?<br/><br/>Carotinoide sind einige der bekanntesten Antioxidantien für die Haut und sie haben auch wichtige Funktionen als entzündungshemmende Mittel.<br/><br/>Gesundes Altern und Hautreparatur<br/><br/>Antioxidantien sind für eine gesunde Haut unerlässlich, da sie helfen, Schäden durch freie Radikale an Zellen zu verhindern. Schäden durch freie Radikale verursachen vorzeitige Alterung und das Auftreten verschiedener Arten von Hautkrebs. Carotinoide, zusammen mit Vitamin E, Vitamin C und Co-Enzym Q10 sind wichtige dermale Antioxidantien.<br/><br/>Aufgrund ihrer antioxidativen Aktivität unterstützen und fördern Carotinoide die Kollagen- und Elastinproduktion in der Haut. Dies hilft, die Dichte, Dicke, Elastizität und Festigkeit der Haut zu erhöhen. Kollagen und Elastin nehmen mit zunehmendem Alter ab, so dass es für das Altern entscheidend ist, genügend Carotinoide in der Ernährung und topisch zu bekommen.<br/><br/>Carotinoide können die Anzeichen von Photoaging, Hautverfärbungen, Elastizität, Feuchtigkeit, Textur verbessern und den transepidermalen Wasserverlust reduzieren.<br/><br/>Insbesondere Astaxanthin regt Fibroblasten zur Produktion von Kollagen und Elastin an, hemmt die Aktivität der Enzyme, die Kollagen und Elastin abbauen, und zeigt entzündungshemmende und UV-filternde Wirkungen. Es wurde gezeigt, dass es Melanin in der Haut reduziert, was zu einer Abnahme des Auftretens von Sommersprossen und Melasma führt.<br/><br/>Anti-Akne-Aktivität: Die entzündungshemmende Wirkung von Carotinoiden hilft, die Entzündung und Reizung im Zusammenhang mit Akne zu dämpfen. Carotinoide helfen auch, Ölsekrete aus den Talgdrüsen zu normalisieren und auszugleichen. Sie sind wertvolle Mittel bei der Hautreparatur und stimulieren die epidermale Regeneration und helfen, die Haut zu glätten und zu erweichen.<br/><br/>Wo finde ich Carotinoide?<br/><br/>Es gibt zwei Möglichkeiten, um Ihre tägliche Dosis von Carotinoiden zu erhalten: durch Diät und durch topische Anwendung. Die Kombination von beiden ist der ideale Ansatz für eine gut alternde Hautpflege.<br/><br/>Carotinoide sind fettlöslich, so dass Ihr Körper Fett braucht, um sie aufzunehmen (denken Sie an Tomaten und Olivenöl, Brokkoli und Butter oder Spinat und Avocado). Gemeinsame Quellen von Carotinoiden in Lebensmitteln sind Avocado, Eigelb, Grünkohl, Spinat, Karotten, Süßkartoffeln, Papaya und Tomaten.<br/><br/>Während wir uns dafür einsetzen, so viele Ihrer Nährstoffe und Antioxidantien wie möglich aus der Nahrung zu beziehen, zeigte eine Studie, dass Astaxanthin in Kombination mit Kollagenhydrolysat die Barriereintegrität signifikant verbesserte, den transepidermalen Wasserverlust reduzierte und die Expression von Procollagen Typ I mRNA erhöhte.<br/><br/>Aktuelle Anwendung ist der Schlüssel zu einer gesunden Haut. Studien zeigen, dass hohe Konzentrationen von Antioxidantien in der menschlichen Haut den besten Schutz für gesunde Haut in jedem Alter bieten.<br/><br/>Bei Sarka Botanicals mischen wir Carotinoide, ganze Pflanzen wie Calendula, Löwenzahn und Extrakte wie Astaxanthin mit kaltgepressten Ölen und funktionellen Inhaltsstoffen. Calendula allein enthält über 19 verschiedene Arten von Carotinoiden. Dies könnte erklären, warum es so lange in der Hautpflege verwendet wird. Studien zeigen, dass Carotinoide, die mit Co-Enzym Q10 gemischt werden, besonders wirksam sind, um Entzündungen zu reduzieren und vorzeitige Hautalterung durch Sonneneinstrahlung zu verlangsamen. |
