| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Johnson den Voting Rights Act von 1965.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Vor fast einem Jahrhundert erklärte der 15. Verfassungszusatz: "Das Wahlrecht der Bürger der Vereinigten Staaten darf von den Vereinigten Staaten oder einem Staat aufgrund von Rasse, Hautfarbe oder Vorbedingung der Knechtschaft nicht verweigert oder verkürzt werden." Und fast ein Jahrhundert zuvor haben die Gründerväter unserer Nation das große Experiment der amerikanischen Demokratie in Gang gesetzt, indem sie erklärten, dass "alle Menschen gleich geschaffen sind".<br/><br/>Der Voting Rights Act von 1965 war eine verspätete Bestätigung, dass selbst in Amerika unsere Grundideale wenig Gewicht haben, wenn sie nicht durch die Rechtsstaatlichkeit geschützt sind. Aus diesem Grund hat Abschnitt 2 des 15. Verfassungszusatzes dem Kongress die "Macht verliehen, diesen Artikel durch geeignete Gesetze durchzusetzen".<br/><br/>Und in der Tat war die kodifizierte Sprache des Stimmrechtsgesetzes in der Lage, das zu erreichen, was der Kongress der Rekonstruktionszeit und Thomas Jefferson nicht konnten. Der civil rights act von 1964 und der voting rights act - und die bürgerrechtsbewegung, aus der sie hervorgegangen sind - dienten als katalysator für eine dramatische zunahme der gelegenheit für schwarze amerikaner, am demokratischen prozess teilzunehmen.<br/><br/>Zum Beispiel wurden nur 6,7 Prozent der in Frage kommenden schwarzen Mississippier ab 1962 zur Stimmabgabe registriert. 1969 hatte diese Zahl 66,5 Prozent erreicht. Heute hat Mississippi mehr schwarze gewählte Beamte als jeder andere Staat.<br/><br/>Die durch das Stimmrechtsgesetz geschaffenen Schutzmaßnahmen waren bei ihrer Verabschiedung längst überfällig und repräsentativ für den mühsamen Kampf, mit dem sie erreicht wurden. Aber unvorstellbarerweise werden diese Schutzmaßnahmen jetzt angegriffen und gefährden den Fortschritt, für den unsere Nation so hart gearbeitet hat.<br/><br/>Letztes Jahr, im Fall von Shelby County v. Holder, entkernte der Oberste Gerichtshof der USA eine Schlüsselkomponente des Stimmrechtsgesetzes, die eine vorherige Überprüfung des Bundes ermöglichte, um die Nichtdiskriminierung zu gewährleisten, bevor ein neues Abstimmungsgesetz in Kraft trat.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Leider war die Antwort der republikanischen Führer nichts zu tun. Senator Ted Cruz und Gouverneur Rick Perry gingen aus dem Weg, um die Entscheidung des Obersten Gerichtshofs zu loben. Senator Rand Paul wies die anhaltende Notwendigkeit des Voting Rights Act zurück, indem er feststellte: "Wir haben einen afroamerikanischen Präsidenten."<br/><br/>Während die Wahl von Präsident Barack Obama in der Tat ein historischer Meilenstein war, ist es gefährlich zu denken, dass sie uns davon abhält, wachsam zu bleiben gegen die anhaltenden Konsequenzen der Vergangenheit unserer Nation. Die Eile, mit der die Staaten zur Einführung von Stimmrechtsbeschränkungen übergegangen sind, ist eine Bestätigung dafür, dass die in § 4 vorgesehenen Schutzmaßnahmen weiterhin erforderlich sind.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Republikanische Gouverneure haben strenge Foto-Identifikationsbeschränkungen als Lösung für ein praktisch nicht existierendes Problem der Wähler-Imitation unterzeichnet, das Frauen, junge Menschen, arbeitende Familien und die afroamerikanische Gemeinschaft unverhältnismäßig verletzt. Es ist unaufrichtig für republikaner wie paul, die stimmen dieser gemeinden zu suchen, wenn sie glauben, dass es nichts falsch daran gibt, beschränkungen einzuführen, die es diesen wahlkreisen erschweren, zu wählen.<br/><br/>Die Republikaner haben auch versucht, die frühen Wahlperioden einzuschränken, einschließlich des Sonntags vor dem Wahltag, an dem afroamerikanische Kirchen großen Erfolg mit Souls to the Polls-Programmen hatten.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Diese Einschränkungen stellen eine gefühllose Anstrengung der Republikaner dar, die Abstimmung zu erschweren, basierend auf engen, kurzfristigen politischen Berechnungen, dass die Republikaner Wahlen gewinnen können, indem sie die Größe der Wählerschaft schrumpfen lassen.<br/><br/>Demokraten haben eine ganz andere Mission, wenn es um das Wählen geht: sicherzustellen, dass sich jeder wahlberechtigte Wähler registrieren kann, dass jeder registrierte Wähler abstimmen kann und dass jede Stimme genau gezählt wird.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Das Wahlexpansionsprojekt des Democratic National Committee spiegelt unsere Überzeugung wider, dass eine stärkere Wahlbeteiligung unsere Nation und unsere Demokratie stärkt. Wir werden weiterhin unser unübertroffenes institutionelles Wissen nutzen, um das Wahlrecht gegen Gesetze und Taktiken zu schützen, die versuchen würden, die Abstimmung zu unterdrücken. Und weil die beste Verteidigung ein gutes Vergehen ist, arbeiten wir auch daran, die Abstimmung zu erweitern, indem wir unsere Technologie und Datenressourcen einsetzen, um neue Wähler zu registrieren.<br/><br/>An diesem Jahrestag können wir diejenigen ehren, die gekämpft haben - und in einigen Fällen ihr Leben gegeben haben -, denn die Verabschiedung des Gesetzes ist für Republikaner im Kongress, die sich den Demokraten anschließen, um das Stimmrechtsänderungsgesetz zu verabschieden, um das Versprechen des Stimmrechtsgesetzes von 1965 wiederherzustellen.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, eine Demokratin, vertritt Floridas 23.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Vatikan-Schutzexperte P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. Juni 2021<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ. Bild: Australische Jesuiten.<br/><br/>Der Präsident des Zentrums für Kinderschutz an der Gregorianischen Universität in Rom und Mitglied der Päpstlichen Kommission für den Schutz von Minderjährigen, P. Hans Zollner SJ, war 2018 in Australien, um mit den Führern und Überlebenden des katholischen Ministeriums zu sprechen.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh von Jesuit Communications setzte sich während des Besuchs mit ihm zusammen, um zu untersuchen, wie die Kirche international auf die Missbrauchskrise reagiert und was aus unseren Erfahrungen in Australien gelernt werden kann.<br/><br/>MM: Dies ist Ihre dritte Reise nach Australien. Sie haben eine ganze Reihe anderer Länder besucht, um zu sehen, wie die Kirche auf Missbrauch auf der ganzen Welt reagiert. Können Sie uns eine Vorstellung davon geben, wie das globale Bild aussieht?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Mein Verständnis, nachdem ich etwa 50 Länder auf fünf oder sechs Kontinenten besucht habe, ist, dass die Kirche in den letzten Jahren wirklich beginnt, sich in der Frage zu bewegen, den Opfern gerecht zu werden, ihnen zuzuhören und alles zu tun, was in Bezug auf den Schutz getan werden kann.<br/><br/>Ich war Ende April mit den Jesuitenprovinzialen aus ganz Afrika zusammen, und der Präsident der Jesuitenunterstützung Afrikas und Madagaskars ist sehr engagiert und engagiert. Er hat einen gründlichen Aktionsplan für die Bildung und für die Einführung von Richtlinien überall aufgestellt. Es ist eine sehr rücksichtsvolle und sehr bewusste Anstrengung, alles zu tun, was getan werden kann, um proaktiv als Jesuiten in Afrika engagiert zu werden - auf einem Kontinent, auf dem bis vor ein paar Jahren all dies eine Fremdsprache war.<br/><br/>Eine der Herausforderungen beim Versuch, diesen globalen Ansatz zu entwickeln, besteht darin, dass Sie es mit so vielen Kulturen und so vielen verschiedenen Verständnissen zu tun haben. Wie bringen Sie das zusammen und versuchen, religiöse Gemeinschaften, die sich mit diesen Fragen befassen, auszubilden und zu unterstützen?<br/><br/>Dies ist eine der wichtigsten Fragen, die wir haben. Ich denke, was ich tun kann, ist, die Diskussion anzuregen, das Nachdenken anzuregen und die Menschen so weit wie möglich darauf vorzubereiten, dass sie die Grundlagen schaffen können.<br/><br/>Das Zentrum für Kinderschutz an der Gregorianischen Universität gibt nicht vor, auf jede Frage eine Antwort zu haben. Nicht nur, weil wir die spezifischen Kontexte nicht kennen - wir kennen vielleicht ein paar von ihnen, aber wir sprechen über Tausende von Kulturen, wir sprechen über Hunderte von Sprachen, wir sprechen über sehr unterschiedliche rechtliche Hintergründe. Es variiert sogar manchmal innerhalb eines Landes, wie zum Beispiel Australien, wo Sie Staaten innerhalb des Commonwealth of Australia haben, die andere Gesetze haben als andere Staaten.<br/><br/>Ich bin jemand, der versucht, Diskussionen und Reflexionen hervorzurufen und anzuregen. Ich bin auch sehr glücklich, den Menschen zuzuhören.<br/><br/>Sie haben die Notwendigkeit erwähnt, den Opfern zuzuhören und sie dabei zu unterstützen, gehört zu werden. Wir hatten offensichtlich die Royal Commission hier in Australien, aber was sind einige der anderen Möglichkeiten, wie Sie gesehen haben, dass die Stimmen der Opfer auf der ganzen Welt unterstützt werden?<br/><br/>In Frankreich gibt es eine Diözese, die das eingerichtet hat, was sie "Hörraum" nennen. Dort können sich die Opfer melden und sich ausdrücken. Der Bischof ist anwesend. Es ist ein offener Raum, in dem Menschen, die enorm verletzt wurden, zumindest frei sind, um auszudrücken, was sie von der Kirchenleitung verlangen wollen usw.<br/><br/>Es gibt andere Orte in den USA oder in anderen Ländern, wo Opfer von Diözesen, Provinzen, der Führung der Kirche eingeladen wurden, sich zu melden. Ich muss sagen, dass ich insgesamt denke, dass es einen guten Willen gibt, und es gibt mehr Menschen wie Bischöfe und Provinziale, die den Opfern zuhören, als wir wissen. Aber es gibt kein Modell, den Opfern nicht nur Raum zu geben, um sich auszudrücken und gehört zu werden, sondern auch, um sich aktiv an der Entwicklung der Kirche zu beteiligen.<br/><br/>Was sind einige der dinge, die sie gesehen haben, die wirklich helfen könnten - und die wir hier in australien in betracht ziehen könnten?.<br/><br/>Einer der wichtigsten Punkte, die viele Opfer ansprechen, ist: "Können wir nicht innerhalb der Pfarreien, in den Schulen, ein regelmäßiges Gespräch führen, das Überlebende von Missbrauch als reguläre Mitglieder eines Ausschusses, einer Kommission, eines Untersuchungsausschusses, einer Feedback-Gruppe oder so etwas beinhaltet?" So dass diese Stimme nicht nur zu einem bestimmten Anlass gebracht wird, oder wenn eine Person das Gefühl hat, dass sie an einem Punkt ist, um darüber sprechen zu können, sondern sie wird regelmäßig gehört - bauen Sie diese Stimme in das System auf.<br/><br/>Das wird uns allen helfen. Es wird Überlebenden und Opfern helfen, weil sie sich in der spezifischen Erfahrung und in den spezifischen Lebensherausforderungen, die sie durchgemacht haben, willkommen und geschätzt fühlen werden. Zweitens wird es der Gemeinschaft insgesamt helfen, denn wir können uns zumindest mehr und mehr sensibilisieren für das, was die Anliegen und spezifischen Bedürfnisse der Überlebenden sind - das kann auch mit den Bedürfnissen der jungen Menschen sprechen.<br/><br/>M: Wir haben starke Gruppen von Überlebenden hier in Australien, die sich gegenseitig durch diesen Prozess unterstützen konnten. Aber was Sie sagen, ist, dass wir eine Möglichkeit brauchen, diese Gruppen zu unterstützen und diese Menschen auch durch unsere eigenen Institutionen zu unterstützen?<br/><br/>Und ich denke, wir müssen kreativ sein. Es wird für eine Schule und eine Pfarrei und eine Diözese auf eine Weise und für andere auf eine andere Weise funktionieren. Weil die Überlebenden, mit denen ich in ständigem Kontakt stehe, ganz ähnliche Wünsche und ähnliche Erfahrungen haben, wenn es darum geht, in der Kirche willkommen zu sein oder nicht – sich hinausgeworfen oder entlassen zu fühlen. Aber sie haben auch unter sich ganz andere Erwartungen. So habe ich gelernt, dass Sie auch sehr entgegenkommend sein müssen, wenn Sie die Unterschiede in dem akzeptieren, was diese bestimmte Gruppe oder dieser bestimmte Überlebende will, fordert und braucht.<br/><br/>M: Überlebende sprechen davon, dass sie ihre Geschichten hören und anerkennen wollen. Wir hatten die Royal Commission hier in Australien, die einen unabhängigen Prozess zur Verfügung stellte, in dem die Opfer sich melden konnten. Braucht es so etwas in Bezug auf einen Wahrheits-, Gerechtigkeits- und Versöhnungsprozess für die Kirche auf internationaler Ebene?<br/><br/>H: Ja, ich denke, das ist international notwendig. Aber ich denke, zuerst muss jede örtliche Gemeinde ihre eigenen Hausaufgaben machen. Ich sehe es nicht sehr bald, dass ein solcher Rat oder eine solche Kommission eingesetzt wird, um diesen Bereich für die ganze Kirche zu untersuchen. Die Kirche hat eine Mitgliederzahl von 1,3 Milliarden Menschen und ist in 190 Ländern präsent, mit allen möglichen Unterschieden in den Erwartungen in Bezug auf psychologische, spirituelle und finanzielle Unterstützung.<br/><br/>Es gibt eine sache, auf die ich bei der kommunikation, der arbeit mit und dem zuhören von opfern konsequent gestoßen bin, und das ist, dass sie gehört werden wollen. Wenn es also das Gefühl gäbe, dass Opfer ständig gehört werden - in Rom und anderswo -, würde das vielen Opfern eine große Erleichterung bringen.<br/><br/>Ich denke, [Papst Franziskus] Sorge, vor allem in Bezug auf Ihre Frage, ist, dass die lokalen Kirchen tun, was sie können, damit die Opfer in diesem bestimmten Land gehört werden. Ich habe eine Liste von Menschen, die direkt mit dem Heiligen Vater sprechen wollen, und physisch ist es unmöglich. Ich war 2014 dort, um für zwei deutsche Überlebende zu übersetzen, die mit zwei irischen und zwei englischen Überlebenden ausgewählt wurden, als er die sechs von ihnen zu Hause empfing. Er nahm den ganzen Morgen, um ihnen nacheinander zuzuhören. Für jeden war er 40 bis 45 Minuten da, wenn er das für jeden Überlebenden tun würde, der nicht mehr schlafen könnte.<br/><br/>Sein Beispiel ist das Modellieren für die ganze katholische Kirche, wie Opfer und Überlebende empfangen, begrüßt und angehört werden. Ich denke, wenn die Bischöfe und die Provinziale in dieser Welt, in allen Ländern, seinem Beispiel folgen würden, würden viele Überlebende das wirklich schätzen.<br/><br/>Erzbischof Diarmud Martin wurde kürzlich kurz vor dem Weltfamilientreffen über die Päpstliche Kommission zitiert und sagte, dass sie zu klein sei, da sie derzeit eingerichtet sei, um das zu erreichen, was sie erreichen müsse. Muss die Kirche mehr Ressourcen dafür einsetzen, wie sie diese Probleme überwacht?<br/><br/>Im Moment sind wir 16 Mitglieder aus allen Kontinenten und den wichtigsten Sprachgruppen. Wir vertreten eine Vielzahl von Disziplinen und Berufen, und der Zweck der Kommission - wie die Statuten, die gerade verkündet wurden - ist es, den Heiligen Vater zu beraten.<br/><br/>Ein häufiges Missverständnis über die Kommission ist zunächst, dass wir uns mit Fällen von Anschuldigungen befassen, das ist nicht der Fall. Wir haben keine rechtliche oder administrative Befugnis in Bezug auf Fälle, denn wenn es um Missbrauchsvorwürfe geht, sind die Gerichte und das Verfahren festgelegt.<br/><br/>Ein zweites Missverständnis ist, dass wir die Dinge direkt vor Ort fördern. Unser oberstes Ziel ist es, den Heiligen Vater in Fragen zu beraten.<br/><br/>Aus meiner Sicht, ja, wir müssen mehr investieren. Aber wir müssen mehr auf lokaler Ebene investieren, und wir müssen sicherstellen, dass die Vorschläge der Päpstlichen Kommission an den Heiligen Vater weitergeleitet werden - was normalerweise der Präsident tut - und dann gibt es einen Follow-up-Prozess, der widerspiegelt, was wir als unseren Rat gegeben haben.<br/><br/>In Australien überwacht Catholic Professional Standards Limited die Reaktion der Kirche und bietet Richtlinien und Unterstützung, um sicherzustellen, dass alle Institutionen in der Kirche kindersichere Institutionen sind. Braucht es irgendeine organisatorische Unterstützung aus Rom für jene Bischöfe und Diözesen, die darum kämpfen, diese Institutionen zu bilden und den Schutz in diesen Diözesen zu gewährleisten?<br/><br/>Ich glaube, daß sich die Kommission in dieser Richtung entwickeln wird, und daß sie jetzt gerade dabei ist, Experten in diesen Bereichen einzustellen.<br/><br/>Ich denke, die Kirche muss verstehen, dass die Ortskirchen voneinander lernen können. Und mein Verständnis war immer - und ich denke, der Heilige Vater hat uns daran erinnert -, dass die Kirche nicht als zentralisiertes Unternehmen funktionieren wird. Es funktioniert nicht so, effektiv. Jeder Bischof, jede Bischofskonferenz, hat bis zu einem gewissen Grad sein eigenes Leben. Was wir mehr lernen müssen, ist, Kanäle der gegenseitigen Kommunikation zu öffnen.<br/><br/>Es gibt eine Reihe von Dingen, die Menschen für Missbrauch in der Kirche verantwortlich machen. Als Priester und Psychologe, und als jemand, der sich mit Überlebenden getroffen und gearbeitet hat, was sind Ihre Gedanken zu diesem Thema?<br/><br/>Ich denke, die Frage, woher der Missbrauch kommt, ist die wichtigste, und der Papst hat dies in seinem am 20. August veröffentlichten Brief an das Volk Gottes angesprochen. Er sagt im ersten Absatz und wiederholt es immer wieder, dass die Frage des sexuellen Missbrauchs immer - oder fast immer - nicht nur mit der Frage des Machtmissbrauchs, sondern auch mit dem Missbrauch des Gewissens verbunden ist.<br/><br/>Die wirkliche Grundfrage des Missbrauchs ist also viel komplexer als nur die Frage der Sexualität – sei es heterosexuell oder homosexuell. Es ist eine Machtfrage, und da müssen wir wirklich an der Frage arbeiten, wie wir das Priestertum verstehen, wie wir die Bischofschaft verstehen, wie wir unsere Dienste verstehen und ausleben?<br/><br/>Deshalb bin ich sehr froh, dass die Jesuitenprovinz in Australien einen Verhaltenskodex aufstellt, weil wir nicht nur über sexuellen Missbrauch von Minderjährigen sprechen. Wir sprechen über sexuellen Missbrauch von Erwachsenen, und wir sprechen über Missbrauch auf andere Weise - wie Missbrauch des Gewissens, wo Sie jemandem diktieren, was Sie denken, oder Sie vorgeben, von Gott zu wissen, und Sie können einer anderen Person sagen: "Du musst das tun", gegen das Gewissen dieser Person.<br/><br/>Viele Menschen glauben, dass Zölibat Missbrauch hervorruft. Wie ich immer sage, ist der Zölibat als solcher kein Grund zum Missbrauch - sonst wie erklären wir, dass 99,9 Prozent aller Missbraucher kein zölibatäres Leben führen, und wie erklären wir, dass 95 oder 96 Prozent aller Priester keine Minderjährigen missbrauchen? Aber Zölibat oder ein Gelübde der Keuschheit, das nicht wirklich integriert ist, das nicht wirklich richtig gelebt wird - ja, das erzeugt ein Problem. Manchmal nehmen die Menschen zu trinken, manchmal nehmen sie zum Glücksspiel, und manchmal nehmen sie zu sexuellem Fehlverhalten, mit Erwachsenen und mit Minderjährigen.<br/><br/>Die eigentliche Frage dabei ist, wie wir mit dem Begriff der religiösen spirituellen Macht umgehen, mit der Priester und Bischöfe beschäftigt sind? Wie kann uns die Theologie helfen zu verstehen, und wie kann uns die Soziologie, Psychologie oder Betriebswirtschaft helfen, die Grenzen der Macht und die Notwendigkeit zu definieren, deine Grenzen zu halten? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Ich bin nicht überrascht von diesem Missverhältnis. Tatsächlich würde ich sogar so weit gehen zu sagen, dass dies nichts ist, was sich jemals ändern wird, noch sollten wir uns alle darüber ärgern, es zu ändern. In 10 Jahren werden wir immer noch blutende Kanten, komplexe Gegenstände in der Liste der größten Sorgen haben, und die Dinge, die wir endlich verstehen, werden die Hauptteile unserer Ausgaben sein.<br/><br/>Jetzt haben Gunnar und Andy beide hervorragende Punkte, insbesondere über IT-Teams, die IT-Probleme sehen und sie mit IT-Lösungen lösen.<br/><br/>Aber ich denke, es gibt andere Ideen, die diese übertrumpfen (ich habe ihre Blogs darüber kommentiert und später beschlossen, dass ich hier nur bloggen sollte). Diese Top-3-Anliegen sind blutig neu, so dass:<br/><br/>Wir fürchten neue Dinge, weil wir sie nicht verstehen, oder wir verstehen sie nicht, weil sie neu sind.<br/><br/>Sie sind zu neu für uns, um solide Ansätze zu haben, sie zu handhaben.<br/><br/>Sie sind zu neu für uns, um zu wissen, ob wir uns Sorgen machen sollten oder nicht! Wir neigen dazu, paranoid / besorgt zu sein, was gut ist!<br/><br/>Kann ich eine Box oder eine Software kaufen, die "Cloud-Sicherheit" oder "Social Media-Sicherheit" bietet?<br/><br/>Sie sind so neu, dass das Unternehmen nicht einmal weiß, wie man sie benutzt oder was sie von ihnen wollen. Geschweige denn, wie wir sie sichern können, während wir immer noch alle Geschäftsanforderungen erfüllen oder zumindest nicht stampfen. Wenn das Unternehmen noch nicht einmal weiß, wie man sie benutzt, bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob die Sicherheit in der Lage ist, diese Verwendung sicher zu führen.<br/><br/>Es sollte auch erwähnt werden, dass diese neuen Dinge weitgehend über Consumerland und ins Geschäft gedrängt werden, wobei die IT als eine Art "Oh yeah" gedacht ist. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth sind alle IT-Antworten auf typische IT-Probleme. Natürlich gibt es da einen Unterschied. Sie sind auch sehr subjektive Probleme, im Gegensatz zu sehr objektiven Elementen wie Firewalls, bekannten bösartigen Bits, Verhaltensweisen, Signaturen, Ports. Das Geschäft stellt sehr komplexe Probleme dar, an denen oft Menschen beteiligt sind (die wir nicht patchen können) und die oft nicht gut in allgemeine Regeln passen. Selbst wenn wir uns von technischen Lösungen abwenden und unsere Zeit darauf verwenden, diese Probleme zu lösen, werden sie immer noch nicht ordentlich gelöst. Ebenso können Sie, wenn es darum geht, Ziele mit Firewalls zu erreichen und zu erreichen? Können Sie Verbesserungen zeigen? All dies ergibt sich aus dem eher subjektiven, nicht-technischen Aspekt dieser Probleme. Art des Unterschieds zwischen dem Bericht eines Kindes und dem Feedback, das Sie von einer Eltern-Lehrer-Konferenz erhalten. Wenn Sie ein Kind haben, welches würden Sie am ehesten ablehnen oder nicht unbedingt glauben? (Die Antwort ist die subjektive!)<br/><br/>Man könnte sagen, dass dies der natürliche Fortschritt von Sicherheit und Technologie ist: von der Unterstützung der technischen Kontrollen bis hin zum Hochfahren des Stapels hin zu Verhalten und Menschen. Sicher, diese 3 wichtigsten Bedenken können gesagt werden, um durch Firewalls und Netzwerksegmente zu schlagen, aber das ist die Natur dieser Dinge (Social Media "Punching" durch eine Firewall ist weit anders als ich durch eine SSH-Verbindung zu schlagen, um mein Heimnetzwerk zu überbrücken; Social Media ist ähnlich dem * Weg * Ich benutze meine SSH-Verbindung, nachdem der Halt bereits gelocht ist, weil es benötigt wird; d.h. Social Media ist die Art, wie Port 80 verwendet wird.)<br/><br/>Im Grunde deuten alle Anzeichen darauf hin, von dieser Dichotomie nicht überrascht zu sein. Und ich denke nicht, dass dies ein weiterer Hinweis darauf ist, dass IT / Sicherheit es falsch macht oder nicht richtig mit dem Geschäft übereinstimmt oder einen technischen Hintergrund hat. Ich sage nicht, dass wir die Dinge richtig machen oder richtig ausgerichtet sind, aber das oben genannte ist kein gutes Argument, um die Theorie dieser Mängel zu unterstützen.<br/><br/>Jetzt für einen wirklich großen Sprung. Ich würde die aktuelle Zunahme im mobilen Computing vergleichen, um so groß zu sein wie die Einführung von Computern in das Geschäft und später der PC / Internet in das Geschäft. Nun, ich war nicht da, als das erstere passierte, noch war ich in der Branche, als die Revolution des Personal Computers ins Geschäft kam, aber ich würde wetten, dass das der bisher engste Vergleich ist. Diese sind verdammt neu und sie sind große Veränderungen, die über das bloße Einbringen von Macs oder neuer Software oder eines neuen Geschäftsprozesses hinausgehen. |
