| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Während man anerkennt, dass es unmöglich ist, jemanden dazu zu bringen, etwas zu lieben, das er hasst, und umgekehrt, ist es immer noch oft angenehm, das argument zu versuchen. Wenn wir mit Menschen sprechen, deren Meinungen direkt unseren widersprechen, sind wir gezwungen, unseren Geschmack zu verteidigen, unsere Meinungen zu definieren und zu analysieren, warum wir so reagieren, wie wir es tun. Deshalb haben wir Why Don't You Like This?, in dem zwei unserer Mitarbeiter versuchen werden, herauszufinden, ob Menschen mit gegensätzlichen Meinungen über "Nein, du irrst dich!" hinauskommen und eine zivile, konstruktive und möglicherweise sogar überzeugende Diskussion über ihre Streitpunkte führen können. Denn egal, was talk radio sagt, es gibt immer noch einen mittelweg zwischen "wir stimmen völlig zu" und "ich habe recht, und du bist dumm und böse.<br/><br/>Scott: Seit wir über meinen Abtrünnigen Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gesprochen haben, haben wir nach einem Fall gesucht, in dem ich dich anrufen kann, weil du etwas Wunderbares nicht magst, und wir mussten nicht lange suchen. Wir saßen direkt nebeneinander während Martin Scorseses Hugo - ich, völlig verzaubert von seiner fantastischen Hommage an die Wunder des frühen Stummfilms, und Sie, anscheinend auf Schritt und Tritt dagegen. Kritischer Konsens war auf meiner Seite: Es traf den Platz Nr. 9 in unserem Kollektiv Top 15 (obwohl Sie es als Ihre überbewertete Wahl aufgeführt haben), hat verschiedene filmkritische Auszeichnungen gewonnen (oder platziert) und genießt derzeit eine 83-Punktzahl auf Metacritic. Das bedeutet natürlich nicht, dass Sie sich irren, aber es liegt an Ihnen, zu erklären, warum Hugo in Ihren Worten "hohl und künstlich" war, wo viele von uns es als eine schöne Beschwörung von Scorseses Kindheit und dem Medium sahen, als es noch in den Kinderschuhen steckte. Und seien Sie bitte sanft, wenn Sie diesen Schmetterling an den Flügeln zerreißen.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Tasha: Ich kann nicht sanft sein, Scott. Manchmal tut es weniger weh, wenn du die Band-Aid auf einmal abreißt. (Und selbst wenn es nicht so ist, wer will mit einer halb abgerissenen Band-Aid herumlaufen? Tatsache ist, dass ich Hugo als eine ermüdend manipulative Übung in der Fälschung empfand, beginnend mit seinem Eröffnungsgleiten durch einen Pariser Bahnhof, was mich mehr als alles andere an Robert Zemeckis 'The Polar Express erinnerte. Im gegensatz zu mike d'angelo bin ich ein fan von langen, ungebrochenen takes, um einen raum zu schaffen und die zuschauer zu ermutigen, unbewusst den atem anzuhalten, während eine kamera einen bereich erkundet; aber wenn der erforschte raum eine glatte, glänzende cgi-kreation ist und die kamera schwerelos durch ihn hindurch schwebt, ohne physischen sinn dafür, dass entweder die kamera oder die umgebung wirklich da ist, beginnt sich die erforschung wie jemand anderes zu fühlen, ein videospiel zu spielen. Und der rest des films fühlte sich für mich ähnlich porenlos und unwirklich an, sowohl in bezug auf seine kulisse als auch in bezug auf seine höchst erfundene, maudlin-geschichte.<br/><br/>Ich habe nicht unbedingt ein Problem mit hergestellten, stilisierten Umgebungen im Film. Ich liebte Baz Luhrmanns ebenso weitläufige, völlig künstliche Einstellung zu Paris in Moulin Rouge, zum Beispiel, aber dieser Film hat einen Sinn für seine eigene Lächerlichkeit, einen Sinn für Humor darüber, wie absichtlich übertrieben er ist. Ganz zu schweigen von der Stilisierung von Jean-Pierre Jeunet, besonders in Amélie. (Sowohl Jeunet als auch Luhrmann empfanden hier starke visuelle Einflüsse.) Ich hatte jedoch das Gefühl, dass Martin Scorsese wollte, dass ich Hugo ganz ernst nehme. Auch wenn es eine weitere schmerzvolle sentimentale Geschichte über eine mutige Waise ist, die Farbe in das Leben eines mürrischen alten Curmudgeons zurückbringt.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Es gibt nichts, was ich im Film mehr genieße, als überrascht zu sein. Und es gibt nichts, was ich mehr verabscheue und widerstehe, als offen manipuliert zu werden, laut gesagt zu bekommen, was ich fühlen und wann ich es fühlen soll. Ein guter Film macht so etwas auf subtile Weise; ein schlechter Film verwendet abstürzende Musiksignale und süße Streicher - und in diesem Fall ein schmutziges, riesiges, zerzaustes Waisenkind, das jämmerlich in die Kamera starrt - um Pathos zu fordern und den Zuschauern zu sagen, dass sie schreckliche Menschen sind, wenn sie es nicht auf Nachfrage bedienen. Das heißt, ich kann mit traurigen Kindern und mürrischen Erwachsenen umgehen, die das Leben füreinander besser machen - ich habe wirklich das diesjährige Le Havre gegraben, das im Wesentlichen die gleiche Handlung ohne all die Niedlichkeit war - aber ich finde, dass die künstlichen Umgebungen schlecht auf die künstlichen Emotionen reflektieren, und jeder lässt den anderen abwechselnd gefälschter erscheinen.<br/><br/>Fangen wir damit an. In unserem übersehenen Filmvideo haben Sie und Noel Keith zur Aufgabe genommen, sich für Tyrannosaur einzusetzen, weil Sie das Gefühl hatten, dass es nicht realistisch genug war - zu erfunden, zu kläglich, zu viel, zu weit. Wie ist es möglich, dass man keinen alten, verstopften Kurbel kaufen kann, der Dinge kaputt macht, wenn er wütend ist, aber man kann ein Waisenkind kaufen, das in einer riesigen Bahnhofsuhr lebt und sich auf eine skurrile Reise begibt, um einen mysteriösen Automaten zu reparieren, von dem er glaubt, dass er Geheimnisse von seinem toten Vater tragen könnte, der ihn stattdessen auf eine schrullige Reise der Selbstfindung in das magische Land des Kinos führt? Haben Sie Hugos knalliges Rokoko-Design, aggressives Herzstring-Pluckern oder Schubkarrenladungen von Macke noch nie ein wenig übertrieben oder schwer zu schlucken gefunden?<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet und Luhrmann als Einflüsse auf Scorsese?! Vergessen Sie, unanständig zu sein, jetzt stechen Sie mich absichtlich mit einem scharfen Stock. Wenn Sie nach Inspirationen für Hugo suchen - in der Tat, wenn Sie nach dem emotionalen Kern von Hugo suchen - müssen Sie zurück zu Scorseses Kindheit in der Elizabeth Street in Little Italy gehen, wo sich ein asthmatischer kleiner Junge, der nicht mit den anderen Kindern draußen spielen konnte, zu Alexander Korda-Fantasien wie Der Dieb von Bagdad zurückzog. Oder, einfacher gesagt, gehen Sie einfach direkt zur Quelle selbst: George Méliès, dessen A Trip To The Moon der Urknall aller filmischen Fantasien bleibt, jener Moment, in dem die Kamera nicht dazu benutzt wurde, die Welt zu dokumentieren, wie sie ist, sondern welchen skurrilen, magischen, transportierenden Ort ein Filmemacher dafür erfinden möchte. Und diese Tradition wurde jahrzehntelang entwickelt und erweitert, bevor Jeunet und Luhrmann ihre schmutzigen kleinen Pfoten darauf bekamen.<br/><br/>Apropos Jeunet, netter Versuch, meine rhetorische Waffe wegzunehmen, aber ich sage es trotzdem: Wie kann man Amélie lieben, aber Hugo synthetisch und "übermäßig" und "müde manipulativ" finden? Sie sagen, dass Amélie und Moulin Rouge den "Sinn ihrer eigenen Lächerlichkeit" erlösen, wo Scorsese bedeutet, dass wir Hugo ernst nehmen, und ich glaube nicht, dass das der Fall ist, zumindest in letzterem Punkt. Dass Scorsese eine offensichtliche Leidenschaft für die Filme empfindet, ist vermutlich der Grund, warum man Hugo als selbsternst interpretieren würde. Aber für mich sind es diese Gefühle, die dem Film einen emotionalen Ballast verleihen, den die Luhrmann- und Jeunet-Filme nicht haben. Alle drei Filme machen aggressiv Gebrauch von den Wundern von CGI - und Scorsese fügt dem Mix 3D hinzu, um eine wunderbare Wirkung zu erzielen - aber wo Sie und ich uns unterscheiden, ist das Problem der Schwerelosigkeit. Ich stimme zu, dass CGI eine distanzierende Wirkung hat; Welten, die ausschließlich aus digitalem Plastilin bestehen, sind flexibel bis zu dem Punkt, an dem sie manchmal keine Präsenz haben. Sie haben Hugo in Ihrem "Overrated"-Eintrag für unser Best Of Film-Stück als "ein CGI-Gimcrack" bezeichnet - eine perfekte Dis... für einen anderen Film.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Es ist fair zu sagen, dass Scorsese Hugo um eine Standard-Ausgabe, "Herzstring-Plucker" Kinderbuch / Filmhandlung gebaut hat: Waisen vermisst seinen Vater, schafft seine eigene kleine Fantasiewelt, gloms auf einen neuen Freund, überzeugt einen knusprigen alten Fuddy-Duddy zu erweichen und vielleicht ihn zu adoptieren. Aber das ist nur das erzählerische Skelett, und Scorsese liefert viel Fleisch und Blut. Zum einen kann man Hugo, den einsamen Jungen, nicht beobachten, der von den Uhrentürmen zum Trubel eines Pariser Bahnhofs späht, ohne an Scorsese zu denken, einen anderen einsamen Jungen, der aus seinem Schlafzimmerfenster in der Elizabeth Street starrt. Und selbst wenn Sie nicht groß genug sind, um diese Verbindung herzustellen, habe ich wirklich das Gefühl, dass Hugos Reise nicht darin besteht, eine neue Vaterfigur zu finden, sondern darin, mit der mechanischen Magie fortzufahren, die als Vermächtnis seines eigenen Vaters steht. Das ist der Film: Die Persistenz des Sehens, die es uns erlaubt, eine illusorische Version der Welt mit 24 Bildern pro Sekunde zu akzeptieren, ist Wissenschaft und Magie zugleich. In Hugos Beziehung zu Méliès geht es nicht darum, dass er sich mit einem neuen Daddy anfreunden will, sondern dass er eine gemeinsame Begeisterung teilt, die der alte Mann in Bitterkeit versunken hat.<br/><br/>Haben Sie wirklich nichts von Hugo bezaubernd gefunden? Selbst die wenigen Kritiker des Films scheinen zuzugeben, dass die Sequenzen, die an die Kinogeschichte und Méliès' Studio erinnern - mit Michael Stuhlbarg als heroischem Filmgelehrten! - grandios waren. Es fühlte sich auf die bestmögliche Weise wie eine berauschende Komprimierung meiner History Of Film 101-Klasse im College an, die Clips und den Kontext eines Semesters zu etwas zwischen einer Montage und einem animierten Pop-up-Buch verdichtete. Und es spricht für das geniale Design des Films, das Fakten und Fantasie so schön schichtet, dass es gleichzeitig eine Geschichte von Méliès und der Geburt des Kinos ist, und genau die Art von einfachem, üppig produziertem Kinowunder, das Scorsese selbst als Kind geliebt hätte. Gott sei Dank folgt Hugo nicht dem Jeunet/Luhrmann-Modell und hat "einen Sinn für seine eigene Lächerlichkeit". Würdest du nicht als Fantasy-Kenner selbst sagen, dass es einen Wert hat, es gerade und ernsthaft und unverfroren zu spielen, anstatt dem Publikum zuzucken? Du findest Hugo vielleicht kränklich süß, aber ich glaube nicht, dass die Authentizität seines Gefühls geleugnet werden soll.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Tasha: Ja, ich fand tatsächlich Teile von Hugo bezaubernd. (Beachten Sie, wie ich Ihre Frage im Voraus beantworte, während Sie zu beschäftigt waren, mit Apoplexie zu schäumen, um meine anzusprechen, obwohl ich davon ausgehe, dass dies eine Antwort für sich ist. Okay, "Einfluss" könnte den Fall überbewerten - ich meinte nur, dass der visuelle Stil sehr vertraut aussah. Obwohl, wie Keith darauf hinwies, als Sie dies persönlich angesprochen haben, ist Scorsese weder dagegen, sich von den Bildern anderer Leute inspirieren zu lassen, noch immun dagegen.) In erster Linie war ich fasziniert von den Teilen, die sich mit der Hintergrundgeschichte von Georges Méliès beschäftigten, von seiner Liebe zum Kino, von der Arbeit, die er in seine Kunst steckte, und von der Freude, die er daraus machte. Es gibt eine Menge Schönheit und Spaß in der Inszenierung der Unterwasser-Court-Szene aus Méliès "Fairyland", und in der Sequenz am Ende, konzentriert sich auf Méliès Filmmaterial. Ich gebe Ihnen zu, dass Hugos Verbindung zu Méliès über eine gemeinsame Liebe zum Film eine nette Geste ist. Und ich genieße einen guten Film über das Filmemachen.<br/><br/>Aber Hugo geht es nicht primär um Film, trotz der Méliès-Krawatten. Neben den Themen, die Sie zitieren, geht es auch darum, Ihren Zweck zu finden, wie die Charaktere sich gegenseitig und uns ausdrücklich mühsam erklären. Und es geht um Spektakel und große Action-Setpieces, und Verfolgungsjagden, und glücklich-immer-nach-Enden, wo selbst der wütende Tyrann und das schüchterne ältere Paar und fergawdsakes sogar der launische Dackel am Ende mit charmanten Liebesinteressen gepaart werden. Es geht darum, dass der superfeine Hermine Granger-Typ herrisch und frech und clever ist und die magischen Welten lobt, die in Büchern enthalten sind. Und all dieses Geschäft ist mächtig vertraut und mächtig künstlich.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese spielt mit Archetypen. Das Problem ist, ich hatte nie das Gefühl, dass er sie trotz seiner eigenen Hintergrundgeschichte mit etwas Neuem, Frischem oder Glaubwürdigem durchdrungen hat. Ich hätte eine Geschichte über einen jungen Scorsese, der mit Asthma aufwächst, lieber gehabt – etwas Kleines und Reales, ohne riesige Räume voller CGI-Uhrwerk und golden leuchtender Staubmotes und prophetischer Träume und eine wütende erwachsene Tyrannengarde mit einem Herzen aus Gold – all diesen übergroßen, übertriebenen Unsinn. Du zitierst immer wieder Scorseses persönlichen Hintergrund und die Liebe zum Film als Beweis dafür, dass er wirklich fühlt, was er auf die Leinwand bringt, aber ich fühle seine persönliche Note in nichts davon, außer den Momenten, in denen es ausdrücklich um Film geht. Die Kernemotionen mögen real sein, aber das macht die Ausführung nicht weniger falsch.<br/><br/>Sie sagen, die Authentizität der Emotion ist nicht zu leugnen. Ich frage mich nicht, ob sich Scorsese persönlich als Kind einsam und isoliert fühlte, aber ich fühle mich nicht einsam und isoliert auf dem Bildschirm - ich sehe einen Haufen übertriebener Signifikanten (Hugo ist schmutzig und seine Kleidung wird getragen und alle Erwachsenen schreien ihn an und er wird regelmäßig von einem gruseligen Hund gejagt!) und große Schläge, mit Schreien und Weinen und Spielbergian Wunder-Emotionen. Für mich ist Aufrichtigkeit überzeugender und persönlicher, wenn es ruhig und direkt ist; Wenn jemand seine Meinung zu mir schreit, nehme ich an, dass er entweder wirklich wütend ist oder nur versucht, meine Sinne zu überwältigen, um mich davon abzuhalten, meine eigene Meinung auszudrücken. Hugo war ein langer Schrei, soweit es mich betraf.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Warum habe ich nicht dieses Fake-Gefühl von Amélie bekommen? Ich werde völlig anerkennen, dass Amélie und Moulin Rouge beide große, manipulative, künstliche Konstruktionen in genau der gleichen Richtung sind, die in bestimmten Intervallen spezifische Emotionen erfordern und versuchen, diese Emotionen mit schwerem emotionalen und aggressiven Soundtrack zu verkaufen. Keiner von ihnen verkaufte mich wirklich an ihre Emotionen als authentisches menschliches Gefühl. Was mir in diesen beiden Filmen gefallen hat, war die Konstruktion - insbesondere Amélies berauschende, lächerliche Listen mit zufälligen Charaktereigenschaften und Erfahrungen für seine Besetzung und Moulin Rouges musikalische Zaubertrick-Mashups und Rekontextualisierungen. Ich werde oft auf Geschichten verkauft, die kreative oder ehrgeizige Dinge mit Struktur machen, und beide Filme qualifizieren sich, wo Hugo eine viel linearere, Standard-Kinderquest ist.<br/><br/>Aber am Ende kommt es für mich wirklich auf das Gefühl an, dass diese Filme Idioten sind, während Hugo dazu bestimmt ist, in jedem treacly Moment ernst genommen zu werden. Du denkst nicht, dass das stimmt - aber du verteidigst gleichzeitig seine Integrität in Bezug auf seine absolut authentische, in der Geschichte von Scorsese verwurzelte Emotion und sagst mir, dass ich falsch liege, und er meint es nicht ernst genommen zu werden. Wie bringen Sie diese beiden Aussagen in Einklang? Was ist mit dem Film, der Ihnen vorschlägt, dass er nicht für bare Münze genommen werden soll? Und ist es möglich, dass dies nur ein weiterer seltsamer Fall von Benjamin Button ist, in dem ich finde, dass die Verwendung von Kindern in Big-Budget-Filmen weitgehend frech und melodramatisch ist, während Sie als Vater feststellen, dass es Ihren Zynismus umgeht und direkt zu Ihrem Familiengefühl geht?<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Scott: Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob ich meinte, dass Scorsese nicht ernst genommen werden soll; es ist nur, dass er ein skurriles Fahrzeug gewählt hat, mit dem er eine ernsthafte Liebe zu den Filmen ausdrücken kann. Wenn man sagt: "Bei Hugo geht es nicht in erster Linie um Film, trotz der Méliès-Einbindungen", bin ich verwirrt. Ich gebe zu, dass Sie viele Elemente von Hugo übermäßig vertraut und mühsam und voller Spielberg-Wunder-Emotionen finden - es gibt nichts, was ich tun kann, um über diese Wahrnehmung zu streiten, die andere Hugo-Zweifel teilen. Manchmal bedeutet ein Film, zu bezaubern und zu verzaubern, und für einige nicht; Sie haben Hugo und ich haben Amélie, obwohl ich denke, dass letzteres, absichtlich künstlich, für uns bedeutet, es romantisch zu finden. (Anstatt, sagen wir, ein schreckliches mechanisches Gerät, das für eine Saw-Fortsetzung geeignet ist.)<br/><br/>Aber zu sagen, Hugo ist nicht in erster Linie über Film? Wenn es nicht um Film, dann ist es die sinnlos diskursivste Geschichte über [was auch immer Sie denken, es ist über] Ich habe je gesehen. Die Beziehung zwischen Hugo und Méliès ist das Herzstück des Films, und im Mittelpunkt steht nicht nur eine Verbindung zwischen Plucky Orphan und Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, sondern eine gemeinsame Affinität für technische Magie - insbesondere die Magie der Filme. Ich denke, Scorsese und seine Mitarbeiter haben einen Weg gefunden, ihre Begeisterung über die frühen Tage des Kinos durch eine Fantasie auszudrücken, die für alle Altersgruppen zugänglich ist. Die archetypische Kindergeschichte ist hier nur die Kruste; Kino ist der Kuchen. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Was The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button betrifft, sehe ich keine große Verbindung, außer zu versuchen, mich als Benjamin Button-Verteidiger zu entlarven, um meine Glaubwürdigkeit zu schädigen. (Übrigens, wie sind die Extras auf dieser G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Ich habe Ihnen gesagt, dass der schlaflose neue Vater in mir vielleicht anfällig für Benjamin Button war, aber ich kann mir keine Zeit vorstellen, in der mich die Prämisse des Alterns in umgekehrter Richtung nicht bewegen würde. Wie kann man davon nicht betroffen sein?) Und außerdem sehe ich nicht, wie Benjamin Button viel mit Hugo als Film über Kinder zu tun hat, da das nur ein kleiner Teil einer Geschichte ist, die eine viel größere Flugbahn umspannt.<br/><br/>Habe ich dich auch überzeugt? Wahrscheinlich nicht. Aber ich bin froh zu erfahren, dass Hugo für dich nicht ganz frei von Verzauberungen war. Die Sequenzen auf Méliès dem Filmemacher sind das, was Hugo für mich hinübergebracht hat - und darin können wir zumindest etwas Filmliebe teilen.<br/><br/>Werbung<br/><br/>Tasha: Nein, ich kann nicht sagen, dass du mich überzeugt hast, genauso wenig wie ich dich überzeugt habe. Es ist unmöglich, jemanden in eine viszerale Liebe für irgendetwas zu argumentieren, und es sollte wirklich genauso unmöglich sein, jemanden von viszeraler Liebe herunterzureden. Meistens haben Sie mich Hugo in Scott-O-Vision sehen lassen, was eine interessante Erfahrung ist; zumindest bin ich jetzt leicht überzeugt, dass wir es irgendwie nicht geschafft haben, ganz andere Filme zu sehen, die beide irgendwie den gleichen Namen und Regisseur hatten.<br/><br/>Wir hatten jedoch sicherlich unterschiedliche Erfahrungen und konzentrierten uns meiner Meinung nach auf verschiedene Aspekte der Produktion: Ich sehe das Thema "Film ist wunderbar" immer noch nicht als den einzigen Strang des Films, so sehr wie einer unter zu vielen. "Unnötig diskursiv" deckt es fast ab, obwohl ich "oft unnötig süß und kostbar" darüber hinaus werfen würde. Während sie sich auf die leckere kuchenfüllung des films konzentrieren, habe ich das gefühl, dass dieser kuchen mit einem pfund kristallzucker bedeckt war, und ich denke, das macht einen unterschied, unabhängig von der kernbotschaft des films oder einer handvoll toller szenen. Siehe auch Benjamin Button, den ich nicht nur aufgezogen habe, um dich zu quälen - ich denke wirklich, du hast mehr eine sentimentale Ader als ich in Bezug auf Kinder im Kino, besonders wenn sie mehr als Symbole der Verletzlichkeit und Unschuld verwendet werden als als menschliche Charaktere. Hey, weißt du, welcher Film total keine süßen, weitäugigen Moppets hat, die Hoffnung in eine zynische Welt bringen? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Vielleicht werde ich mir diese Blu-ray-Extras ansehen. Ich könnte etwas Explosionsinsulin verwenden, um Hugos Süße zu kompensieren. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Ich hoffte, dass meine Tochter aus schwierigen und beunruhigenden Zeiten frei sein würde": Mee Mees Geschichte als Flüchtlingsmutter<br/><br/>Hoffnung in Zeiten der Krise: Eine Geschichte zum Muttertag<br/><br/>von Judith Santiago<br/><br/>Mee Mee hörte, dass die Soldaten kommen würden. Sie übernahm ihren Sohn und schloss sich verzweifelt dem Rest der Dorfbewohner an, die in Richtung der thailändisch-burmesischen Grenze rannten, wo sich das Büro des Hohen Flüchtlingskommissars der Vereinten Nationen (UNHCR) befand. Ihr Mann war in einem anderen Dorf und lief in die entgegengesetzte Richtung, erfuhr Mee später. Nachdem die Verfolgung der Soldaten beendet war, kehrte Mee nach Hause in ihr kleines Dorf in Koechi, Burma, zurück.<br/><br/>Während 1997-2000 lebten Mee und Tausende wie sie unter der ständigen Bedrohung durch Gewalt von birmanischen Soldaten. Viele Menschen nahmen vorübergehend Zuflucht im Dschungel und kehrten in ihr Dorf zurück, nachdem Soldaten das Gebiet verlassen hatten, nur um es Tage später noch einmal zu tun. Ungefähr einmal in der Woche waren Mee und andere unterwegs, um die Gefangennahme, Vergewaltigung oder den Tod von Soldaten zu vermeiden.<br/><br/>Während eines Vorfalls lief Mees Mann seiner Frau voraus, um sich Essen für seine Familie zu sichern. Ihr Mann wurde von Soldaten gesichtet und erschossen. Die Kugel zerschmetterte einen Teil seines Brustkorbs und ließ ihn schwer verwundet und in Bedrängnis zurück, als er mit seiner Familie zur Sicherheit in den Dschungel reiste.<br/><br/>Drei Monate lang versteckte sich Mees Mann und verlegte die Familie mit einer erbitterten Wunde an seiner Seite. Er erhielt keine medizinische Versorgung, außer Mees Pflege.<br/><br/>"Ich hatte Angst, nach Burma zurückzukehren", sagte Mee durch eine Dolmetscherin. "Ich fürchtete zu sterben. Ich weinte und weinte jeden Tag", fuhr sie fort.<br/><br/>Mees Ehemann zog schließlich genug Kraft, um fünf Tage in Richtung eines kleinen Dorfes in Thailand zu gehen, wo sie den Standort eines Krankenhauses und eines Flüchtlingslagers lernten. Als Mee und ihr Mann schließlich im Krankenhaus ankamen, wurde er sofort operiert und erholte sich später.<br/><br/>Symbol der Hoffnung<br/><br/>Das Leben im Dschungel für die fliehenden burmesischen Soldaten war in der Tat erschreckend und schwierig. Behelfsmäßige Bambuszelte mit nur Dach- und Bodenbelägen wurden zu geeigneten temporären Wohnungen. Viele Frauen, darunter Mee, gebar Kinder im Dschungel. Mees damals sechsjähriger Sohn half bei der Geburt seiner Schwester namens Eh Ku Hser. Ihr Name bedeutet Liebe – kalt – süß. "Kalt" bedeutet in der burmesischen Kultur, nicht durch das Feuer des Lebens zu gehen, da Hitze unruhige Zeiten darstellt.<br/><br/>"Ich hoffte, dass meine Tochter frei von schwierigen und beunruhigenden Zeiten sein würde", sagte Mee. "Ich wollte nicht, dass sie durchmacht, was ich erlebt hatte", fuhr sie fort.<br/><br/>Für Mee war die Geburt ihrer Tochter inmitten von Dunkelheit, Qual und Angst ein Symbol der Hoffnung auf ein neues Leben. Die Hoffnung in Zeiten der Krise, die Prämisse des United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), das kürzlich unter dem Namen UMCOR-Wohlstandskerze gebrandmarkt wurde, ist auch die Essenz dessen, was Kerzen beleuchten.<br/><br/>Ein neuer Anfang<br/><br/>Mit der Hilfe von UNHCR entstand tatsächlich die Hoffnung auf ein neues Leben für Mee und ihre Familie, als sie sich in West Springfield, Massachusetts, niederließen. Dort lernte Mee Moo Kho Paw kennen, eine andere Frau, die aus Burma auswanderte und bei Prosperity Candle in Florenz arbeitete. Die Organisation hilft Flüchtlingsfrauen, die aus Konfliktgebieten geflohen sind, ihr Leben durch die Kunst der Kerzenherstellung wieder aufzubauen. Moo Kho empfahl Mee, sich der Organisation anzuschließen, und Mee nahm sie gerne an.<br/><br/>"Ich war aufgeregt, aus dem Haus zu sein", sagte Mee, "ich wurde erzogen, um zu glauben, dass, weil ich eine Frau war, meine Rolle war, zu Hause zu bleiben und meine Familie großzuziehen", fuhr sie fort. "Während viele birmanische Frauen mehr für sich selbst tun wollen, werden sie oft ermutigt, Hausfrauen zu bleiben."<br/><br/>Heute hat Mee Pläne, für sich selbst ins Kerzengeschäft zu gehen und ihre fünf Kinder zu unterstützen, aber sie drückte die Notwendigkeit aus, zuerst Englisch zu lernen.<br/><br/>"Im thailändischen Flüchtlingslager hatten wir Bildung, aber es war nicht so gut", sagte Mee. "Als ich ein Kind war, wollte ich zur Schule gehen, aber mir wurde gesagt, ich solle zu Hause bleiben, weil ich eine Frau war. Jetzt habe ich Hoffnung, dass meine Töchter aufs College gehen und Ärzte oder Polizistinnen werden", fuhr Mee fort.<br/><br/>Mee hat eine ausgeglichene Balance in ihrem Leben gefunden, die sie sich wünscht, dass andere sie gefunden hätten - ein einfaches, glückliches Leben, in dem Arbeit, die Pflege von Familienmitgliedern und die Freiheit der Wahl ihren Platz haben.<br/><br/>Flüchtlingsfrauen in den USA unterstützen<br/><br/>Teilen Sie diese Muttertagsgeschichte mit Ihren Lieben. Und wenn Sie handgefertigte Kerzen von Mee, Moo Kho und Naw, einer anderen birmanischen Flüchtlingsfrau, die bei Prosperity Candle arbeitet, kaufen, wissen Sie, dass Sie dabei helfen, ihren Lebensunterhalt zu sichern, während sie ihr Leben und das ihrer Familienmitglieder in den USA wieder aufbauen. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Die Befürworter bemerken auch die steigende Zahl von Minderheitenanträgen an Hochschulen und Universitäten, die zum Teil auf positive Maßnahmen zurückzuführen sind.<br/>Statistiken haben bewiesen, dass, wenn affirmative action eliminiert wird, wie wenn es an der Berkley College und UCLA im Jahr 1998, die Minderheit Studenten Zulassungen fiel 61 Prozent und 36 Prozent jeweils, was beweist, dass affirmative action spielt eine wichtige Rolle in einer Minderheit Studenten College Zulassungsverfahren. Affirmative Action Unterstützer glauben auch, dass Vielfalt in der Hochschulbildung bietet eine bessere pädagogische Atmosphäre für alle Studenten, persönlich und intellektuell. Wenn affirmative action eliminiert würde, gäbe es weniger minderheitsstudenten, die an colleges eingeschrieben sind, was dazu führen würde, dass die vielfalt ziemlich gering ist. Um jahrhundertelange rassische, wirtschaftliche und soziale Unterdrückung zu kompensieren, ist eine Politik des affirmativen Handelns notwendig. Personen mit einem höheren sozioökonomischen Status haben mehr Möglichkeiten als Personen mit einem niedrigeren sozioökonomischen Hintergrund. Befürworter glauben, dass bestimmte rassische oder ethnische Gruppen benachteiligt sind, weil sie häufig in Haushalten mit niedrigem Einkommen leben und folglich nicht den gleichen Ressourcen ausgesetzt sind wie Studenten aus höheren sozioökonomischen Klassen. Befürworter unterstützen den Begriff des Wettbewerbs zwischen Studenten auf der Grundlage von Verdiensten, argumentieren jedoch, dass affirmative action wirtschaftliche Unterschiede ausgleicht. Hochschulabsolventen, die von affirmative action profitiert haben, haben auch gesagt, dass sie bessere jobs erhalten, mehr geld verdient haben und insgesamt ein besseres leben führen aufgrund der glücklichen möglichkeiten, die sie durch affirmative action erhalten haben.<br/>Befürworter von affirmative action betonen ständig die große Bedeutung von affirmative action, wenn man bedenkt, dass es sowohl zur Verbesserung der College-Erfahrung als auch der Gesellschaft im Allgemeinen beiträgt. Gegner von affirmative action glauben jedoch, dass die Zeit gekommen ist, um affirmative action zu beenden. Gegner glauben, dass affirmative action geschaffen wurde, um faire Aufnahmepraktiken zu gewährleisten, um eine lange Zeit der Rassendiskriminierung zu verändern.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinationen<br/><br/>Kombinationen sind Abwehrmechanismen gegen einen Schlag, choreografierte Reaktionen auf verschiedene Arten von Angriffen. Sie haben viele Namen in den Kampfkünsten, aber (nach meiner Erfahrung) jede Kunst hat eine Version davon. Das macht sie anders als Formen, weil es viele Kampfkünste gibt, die keine Formen haben. Was macht Partnerübungen so universell? Warum eine bestimmte Reaktion üben, wenn (in Wirklichkeit) Timing, Art des Angriffs, Größe des Angreifers und hundert andere Faktoren es so machen, dass Sie nie die gesamte choreographierte Antwort verwenden? Und schließlich, wie können wir für eine echte Verteidigungssituation üben und gleichzeitig Verletzungen vermeiden?<br/><br/>Die Universalität der Kombinationen ist beeindruckend, gelinde gesagt. Unser Stil von Kenpo Karate hat eine Liste von 108 Combos, die gelernt werden können. (Die meisten Schüler lernen jedoch nur 20-30) Im brasilianischen Jiu-Jitsu verbringen Sie ganze Klassen damit, Armbügel und Chokes zu üben und jede Subtilität zu lernen, während Ihr Partner wenig bis keinen Widerstand bietet. Jeder Boxer hat Stunden vor der Tasche und / oder dem Spiegel verbracht, um die gleiche Kombination von Schlägen zu werfen, bis sich sein Körper allein durch Reflex bewegt. Kombinationen sind universell, weil wir keine bessere Möglichkeit haben, Bewegung einzuführen und dann die subtilen Positionen zu üben, die erforderlich sind, um sie zum Laufen zu bringen. Das Schlagen eines kleinen Druckpunktes durch die Kleidung erfordert VIEL Übung, das Fangen einer Armstange mit Kontrolle erfordert eine sorgfältig platzierte Hüfte und ein hinterhältiges Setup, und eine großartige Kombination ist nur nützlich, wenn Sie sie aus einer ausgewogenen und geschützten Position durchstehen können. Können Sie sich einen besseren Weg vorstellen, um diese Fähigkeiten zu erwerben?<br/><br/>Es gibt eine Reihe von Faktoren, die bestimmen, wie Sie auf einen Angriff reagieren, und ob in einem Sparring-Match oder in einem Kampf, ich habe nie eine volle Kombination in meiner Verteidigung verwendet. Warum verbringen wir dann Stunden damit, sie zu üben? Wir üben diese choreographierten Antworten, weil das Ziel nicht ist, die Kombination 8 jedes Mal herauszuziehen, wenn Sie einen Hakenschlag sehen, sondern Ihnen eine Möglichkeit zu zeigen, sie zu blockieren und dann eine mögliche Möglichkeit, sie zu verfolgen. Ich habe mich nie dafür entschieden, Kombination 3 in einer Realitätssituation zu verwenden, aber der Block ist einer meiner Go-to-Moves. Kombinationen fügen dem Werkzeugkasten Werkzeuge hinzu, die das Auto nicht reparieren.<br/><br/>Die letzte Frage ist eine Frage der Sicherheit. Wenn wir um der Realität willen üben, müssen wir die Realität replizieren. Wie verhindern wir dabei Verletzungen? Wenn es darauf ankommt, geht es darum, Vertrauen aufzubauen. Wir beginnen langsam und lernen, darauf zu vertrauen, dass wir die Kontrolle über uns selbst haben. Wir lernen auch, darauf zu vertrauen, dass unsere Partner die Kontrolle haben. In mehr Zeit lernen wir, unserer Kontrolle über unseren Partner zu vertrauen und (ein wenig gruseliger) lernen wir, der Kontrolle unseres Partners über uns zu vertrauen. Am Ende (mit viel Übung) können Sie sich mit voller Geschwindigkeit bewegen, Ihren Partner werfen und ohne Angst vor Verletzungen geworfen werden.<br/><br/>Kombinationen sind aus einem bestimmten Grund universell; sie werden praktiziert, so dass sie in ihre Teile zerlegt werden können, und wir bleiben sicher, indem wir langsam beginnen und Vertrauen aufbauen. Wie bei allem anderen in den Kampfkünsten haben Kombinationen viele Gründe für ihre Praxis und Ausführung. |
