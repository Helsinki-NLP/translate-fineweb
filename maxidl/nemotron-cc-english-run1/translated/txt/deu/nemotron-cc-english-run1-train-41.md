| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Veröffentlicht von Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa ist eine mehrjährige Pflanze, die in sumpfigen subtropischen und tropischen Regionen auf der ganzen Welt gedeiht. Das hoch angesehene Kraut ist ein Schlüsselbestandteil von Doxiderol, einem Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, das die kognitive Funktion verbessert. Bacopa wurde für seine Fähigkeit ausgewählt, das Gehirn zu schützen und Acetylcholin zu erhöhen, ein biochemischer Botenstoff, der es dem Nervensystem ermöglicht, Informationen weiterzugeben.<br/><br/>Ayurveda-Praktizierende beschrieben erstmals die therapeutischen Eigenschaften von Bacopa im Jahr 300 v. Chr. Die Ärzte zeichneten die Fähigkeiten von Bacopa auf, Intelligenz und Gedächtnis zu verbessern. Fast 2.500 Jahre später bestätigt eine wachsende Zahl moderner Forschung die kognitiven Vorteile von Bacopa, die im ayurvedischen Text aufgezeichnet wurden.<br/><br/>1987 untersuchten Forscher in Indien die Auswirkungen von Bacopa auf die intellektuelle Funktion von Kindern im schulpflichtigen Alter. Während der vierwöchigen Studie verabreichten sie 40 Kindern im Alter von 6 bis 8 Jahren Bacopa. Die Wissenschaftler stellten fest, dass Bacopa die Wahrnehmung und das Gedächtnis erhöhte. Die Kinder konnten Labyrinthübungen schneller und genauer lösen, nachdem sie Bacopa erhalten hatten. Viele Eltern in Indien verwenden Bacopa routinemäßig, um die intellektuelle Entwicklung ihrer Kinder zu verbessern.<br/><br/>Eine 12-wöchige Studie, die in der August 2001 Ausgabe von Psychopharmacology veröffentlicht wurde, untersuchte die Auswirkungen von Bacopa auf die kognitive Funktion. Die Wissenschaftler ordneten den gesunden Freiwilligen im Alter von 18 bis 65 Jahren nach dem Zufallsprinzip Bacopa oder eine inaktive Substanz zu. Sie verwendeten auch eine doppelblinde Konfiguration für die Studie, um die Identität der Produkte zu verbergen. Forscher verwenden dieses Design, um sicherzustellen, dass die Testergebnisse gültig sind, weil es Bias von den Forschern und Teilnehmern eliminiert. Die Bacopa-Gruppe erlebte eine deutliche Verbesserung der Geschwindigkeit, mit der sie visuelle Informationen verarbeiten konnten. Die Teilnehmer lernten auch schneller und speicherten neue Erinnerungen effizienter.<br/><br/>Im Jahr 2007 zeigte eine Laborstudie des Texas A & M College of Medicine einen der Mechanismen, die für die Fähigkeit von Bacopa verantwortlich sind, die Gesundheit des Gehirns zu fördern. Laut den Wissenschaftlern verwendet Bacopa Polyphenole, um oxidativen Stress und die Schäden, die es an gesunden Gehirnzellen verursacht, zu verhindern. Bacopa reduziert auch schädliche Ablagerungen einer Substanz, die als Beta-Amyloid bekannt ist, das der Hauptbestandteil der Plaque im Gehirn von Patienten mit Alzheimer-Krankheit ist.<br/><br/>Eine Doppelblindstudie, die in der Juli-Ausgabe 2008 des Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine veröffentlicht wurde, untersuchte die Wirkung von Bacopa auf ältere Patienten. Die Studie bestätigte, dass Bacopa die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit erhöht und gleichzeitig Stress reduziert. Laut den Autoren bestätigten die in dieser Studie erzielten Vorteile die Ergebnisse früherer Forschungen.<br/><br/>Eine 90-Tage-Studie, die in der Dezember-Ausgabe 2008 von Phytotherapy Research veröffentlicht wurde, bestätigt die kognitiven Vorteile, die zuvor in anderen Bacopa-Studien nachgewiesen wurden. Bacopa verbesserte die Fähigkeit der Teilnehmer, Informationen, die für die Durchführung einer komplexen Aufgabe erforderlich sind, vorübergehend zu speichern und zu verwenden. Die doppelblinde Studie zeigte auch, dass Bacopa die Zeit für die Verarbeitung visueller Informationen verkürzte.<br/><br/>Zusätzlich zur Verbesserung der Nervensignalübertragung theoretisieren die Wissenschaftler, dass Bacopa die kognitive Funktion erhöht, indem es Angst reduziert. Zahlreiche Studien deuten darauf hin, dass Angst die Fähigkeit beeinträchtigt, Aufgaben auszuführen, die höhere kognitive Funktionen erfordern, wie Lernen und Auswendiglernen. Stress stört biochemische Botenstoffe und gesunde Nervensignalübertragung. Bacopa lindert Stress und stellt ein Gefühl der Ruhe wieder her, indem es den Acetylcholinspiegel erhöht, was Ihre Herzfrequenz senkt und es Ihnen ermöglicht, tiefer zu atmen.<br/><br/>Doxiderol ist eine gute Möglichkeit, die Vorteile von Bacopa zu erhalten. Diese ganzheitliche Ergänzung enthält auch andere natürliche Inhaltsstoffe, die die Gesundheit des Gehirns fördern und Ihre Fähigkeit unterstützen, sich auf komplexe Aufgaben zu konzentrieren und sich Informationen zu merken. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Sie kann auch dämonische Auren sowie böse Auren spüren. Als sie jedoch geboren wurde und wuchs, waren ihre Kräfte versiegelt und sie war viel weniger mächtig. Seit der Niederlage desjenigen, der ihre Kräfte versiegelte, hat Kagome ihr volles Potenzial erreicht.<br/><br/>Indem sie eine physische Verbindung herstellt, hat Kagome die Fähigkeit, sowohl Gift als auch Dunkelheit von einem Subjekt (lebendig und unbelebt) zu reinigen. Um dies zu tun, projiziert sie ihre spirituellen Kräfte durch ihre Hand.<br/><br/>Mit ihrem vollen Potenzial hat Kagome die Fähigkeit, eine Barriere um sich herum zu schaffen und sie um andere zu erweitern. Es ist eine kuppelförmige Barriere, die schwache Dämonen zerstören kann, die mit der Barriere in Kontakt kommen.<br/><br/>VERBESSERTE SICHT<br/>Kagome hat die Fähigkeit, Dinge zu sehen, die für das menschliche Auge oft unsichtbar sind: Geister, Geister, göttliche und böse Auren.<br/><br/>ABHÄNGIGKEITEN MIT WAFFEN<br/>Kagome hat die Fähigkeit, einen Bogen und Pfeil zu benutzen. Sie wurde selbst trainiert, und nach Jahren des Übens verfehlt ihr Pfeil selten seine Spuren. Daneben hat Kagome die Fähigkeit, ihre Pfeile mit Kräften zu erfüllen. Sie kann einen Pfeil mit ihren spirituellen Kräften infundieren, was ihnen erlaubt, dämonische Kräfte zu durchdringen, Zauber zu zerstören und Objekte zu reinigen. Sie kann ihren Bogen mit ihren Kräften infundieren und feindliche Angriffe abwenden. Sie hat die Fähigkeit, ihre Pfeile mit reinigender Energie zu füllen, um Gift sowie mächtige, weit entfernte dämonische Angriffe zu reinigen. Und schließlich hat sie die Fähigkeit, andere mit ihrem Pfeil zu umgehen: Wenn ihr Ziel hinter einer Barriere oder einer Geisel liegt, kann der Pfeil teleportieren und nur ihr Ziel treffen.<br/><br/>Der Rest ihrer Fähigkeiten sind ziemlich unwichtig geworden, da sie mit Zeitreisen (durch den Bone Eater's Well), dem Shikon Jewel oder ihrer vorherigen Inkarnation zusammenhängen.<br/><br/>Der Kanon<br/><br/>Kagome wurde jedoch einige Tage nach ihrem Abitur gezogen, bevor der Bone Eater's Well wieder geöffnet wurde, damit sie dauerhaft in die Vergangenheit zurückkehren kann.<br/><br/>Freestyle<br/><br/>Erinnerungen<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Der Klang ihres Namens war ein leises Flüstern in ihrem Hinterkopf, wie ein vom Wind gedämpfter Ruf. Es war der Klang einer fernen Erinnerung, einer Stimme, die sie zu vergessen begonnen hatte, aber verzweifelt an allem klammerte. Es war die Stimme ihrer Mutter, verdreht in der Trauer ihrer verlorenen Tochter. Schließlich verbannte Kagome spurlos. Sie erinnerte sich lebhaft an diese Momente, wie der Tag begonnen hatte, was sie zum Frühstück hatte und das letzte, was sie ihrer Mutter gesagt hatte. Es war eindringlich, diese Erinnerungen, denn es war wie jedes andere Mal, wenn sie zwischen den Welten gerutscht war. Sie war aufgewacht, lustlos, weil sie außerhalb der Schule keinen Zweck hatte. Sie konnte einen Job finden und war an diesem Tag für ein Interview geplant. Ihr Herz war nicht drin gewesen, aber es war das, was sie tun musste.<br/><br/>Sie erinnerte sich an das Gefühl der Angst, saugte es auf und gab sich ein Pep-Gespräch, dass sie dies tun konnte. Dass sie in dem Leben vorankommen konnte, für das sie jetzt bestimmt war, da die Dinge in der Vergangenheit geregelt waren. Natürlich hatte sie das verweilende Gefühl, dass sie nicht mehr zu ihrer eigenen Zeit oder ihrem eigenen Leben gehörte. Nicht mit allem, was sie zurückgelassen hatte.<br/><br/>Kagome erinnerte sich an das Gefühl des Holzes unter ihren Fingern, die Art, wie sich ihre Hand in den Griff gekrümmt hatte, um die Tür zu öffnen. Sie erinnerte sich, dass sie innehielt und sich mit einem hellen und lebendigen Lächeln zu ihrer Mutter wandte, als sie sich aus ihrer Stupor schüttelte. "Ich steige aus." Sie erinnerte sich, wie stark ihre Stimme klang, das Lächeln auf den Lippen ihrer Mutter, während ihre Augen vor Stolz leuchteten. Ihre Mutter verabschiedete sich, was nicht anders schien als zuvor, aber irgendwie lag das Gewicht der Worte schwerer auf Kagomes Schultern, je mehr sie nachdachte.<br/><br/>Kagome konnte offen zugeben, dass die Kraft ihrer Mutter, ihre Unterstützung für die Tatsache, dass ihre Tochter so oft durch die Zeit rutschte. Es gab zeiten, in denen sie sich für schwach hielt, weil sie die frau nicht hatte, auf die sie sich stützen konnte.<br/><br/>Sie erinnerte sich jedoch daran, dass sie eine magere Menge an Kraft aufbrachte. Sie konnte sich an die Verschiebung in der Luft erinnern, die Temperatur, die sich deutlich von dem unterscheidet, was sie erwartet hatte, und blinzelte über die plötzliche und unbekannte Umgebung. Es war nicht der Schrein ihrer Familie, und als sie sich umdrehte, um zurückzukehren, um durch die Tür zu schlüpfen, durch die sie gekommen war, traf sie auf unbekanntes und kaltes Metall unter ihren Fingerspitzen und ein Inneres, das nicht der Eingang ihres Hauses war. Ein Mann stand vor ihr, hinter einer Theke, die sie mit Augen so weit anstarrte wie ihre eigene.<br/><br/>Sie war zumindest nicht in Panik. Durch die Zeit gerissen und in unmögliche Situationen gebracht zu werden, baute zumindest deine Willenskraft auf, soweit es seltsame Ereignisse gab. Weil es nicht jeden Tag war, dass jemand von einem Dämon in die Vergangenheit gezogen wurde, um ein mächtiges Juwel aus ihrem Körper zu reißen, von dem sie nicht einmal wussten, dass es dort war. Und dann war da noch die Tatsache, dass sie das mächtige Juwel zerschmettert hatte, wer weiß, wie viele Stücke und wurde beauftragt, sie zu finden. Solche Dinge waren nicht normal, und sie musste sich damit auseinandersetzen, als sie erkannte, dass das ihre Realität war. Es schien so einfach zu sein, nur die Scherben zu sammeln und das Juwel zu reparieren.<br/><br/>Aber es war nicht einfach gewesen, es gab viele Dämonen nach den Scherben und dem Juwel selbst. Und ein besonders mächtiger Dämon mit dem Wunsch, dass er entschlossen war, erfüllt zu sehen. Bis zum heutigen Tag hatte sie seinen Wunsch nie gelernt, aber sie wusste, dass er nie gewährt worden war, auch wenn er das Gesprengte vollendet hatte. Er hatte so viele Leben um des Nichts willen ruiniert. Ruinierte so viele Leben für eine so vergebliche Aufgabe. Naraku war der schwierigste Feind gewesen, und derjenige, der der Mittelpunkt von allem gewesen war, was im Leben ihrer Freundin schief gelaufen war.<br/><br/>Aber es war diese Unvorhersehbarkeit, diese Notwendigkeit, mit dem zu rollen, was geschah, und die Willenskraft, die sie aus ihrem Abenteuer gewonnen hatte, an die sie sich erinnerte, um eine Geschichte zu entwickeln, die in den Moment passte, die nicht zu skurril oder weit hergeholt schien. Man musste ihr glauben, sie musste überleben.<br/><br/>Schließlich sah sie sich schlimmer gegenüber als ein Mann in einem Kameraladen. Sie hatte zuvor durch ihre Zähne gelogen, um ihr Leben zu retten.<br/><br/>"Ich war auf der Suche nach einem Job." Am Ende war es keine komplette Lüge. Schließlich war sie mit der Absicht aus ihrem Haus aufgebrochen, an einem Vorstellungsgespräch teilzunehmen. Ihr Zustand der Kleidung würde zumindest das bestätigen. Es war einer der einfacheren Fibs, die sie jemals erzählt hatte.<br/><br/>Und aus irgendeinem Grund hat dieser verrückte Mann sie angeheuert.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Kagomed drehte sich in ihrem Bett um, als sie die fernen Erinnerungen zurückdrängte und sich weigerte, anzuerkennen, dass sie wirklich wach war. Sie krallte beim letzten Blick auf den Schlaf und flehte ihn an, zurückzukehren und sie wieder in seine Umarmung zu nehmen. Sie schloss die Augen, wollte schlafen und wurde nur mit Erinnerungen erfüllt. Das Echo eines Liedes sang in der Ferne ihrer Erinnerungen, ein Lied, das sie oft gequält hatte, mit dem gleichen Namen wie sie. Die Stimme, die sang, erinnerte nicht mehr an ihre Mutter, sondern an die Stimmen der Kinder, mit denen sie oft gespielt hatte. Sie riefen die Erinnerungen zurück, obwohl es Jahre her war, seit sie dieses Leben begonnen hatte, obwohl sie in diesem Leben glücklich war, war der Ruf dieser Erinnerungen zu laut.<br/><br/>Plötzlich fiel sie in sie zurück und der Schlaf wich ihr wieder aus. Sie beobachtete sich in der Umarmung ihrer Familie, während Inuyasha zurück in den Brunnen gezogen wurde. Sie sah erschrocken aus, wie sie sich gefühlt hatte. Die Erinnerungen an diesen Moment, diese Gefühle, waren immer noch so stark. Das Gefühl von Herzschmerz und Trauer wellte sich wieder auf, obwohl es schon so lange her war, dass sie das Gefühl hatte, von allem, was ihr wichtig war, weggerissen worden zu sein.<br/><br/>Natürlich spielte ihre Familie eine Rolle, und sie war glücklich, wieder in ihren Armen zu sein. Sie konnte nie vollständig, wirklich beschreiben, wie sie sich in jenen Tagen gefühlt hatte. Sie konnte immer noch nicht erklären, wie sie sich in zwei Teile gespalten fühlte. Sie hatte den Wunsch, sowohl in ihrer Vergangenheit als auch in ihrer Gegenwart zu sein. Sie erinnerte sich an die vergeblichen Versuche, durch den Brunnen zu springen. Im ersten Monat zu Hause schlief sie nicht so viel, wie sie weinte.<br/><br/>Elysion hatte eine ähnliche Reaktion garniert, obwohl sie nicht so heftig war, weil sie nicht genau wusste, wo sie durchgerutscht war, noch wusste sie, wo sie sich den Weg zurück wühlen konnte. Ihre Erkundungen waren subtil zwischen ihrer Arbeit und dem Versuch, sich in dieses Leben einzuleben. Sie hatte keine Absichten zu bleiben, keine Absichten, länger zu verweilen, als sie brauchte. Und obwohl sie es nicht so heftig versuchte, wie sie es getan hatte, als sie versuchte, in die Vergangenheit zurückzukehren, war ihre Leidenschaft zehnfach, weil sie keine Bindung zu dieser Welt hatte. Weil sie wirklich allein war... ohne Hoffnung von niemandem, sie zu erreichen.<br/><br/>In ihren irrationalen Momenten dachte sie, das Juwel hätte sie zurückgehalten und eine neue Hölle gefunden, in der sie leben könnte. Eine neue Hölle, die sie zwingen würde, sich einen Wunsch zu machen, aber sie erinnerte sich sehr klar daran, dass sie sich gewünscht hatte, dass es für immer vorbei wäre. Das hielt ihre Träume nicht auf, die Zeiten, in denen sie in der Nacht aufwachte und schluchzte. Und diese Erinnerungen an ihre Vergangenheit waren am schwersten zu bewältigen, am schwersten zu vergessen. Ihr Herz begann in Panik zu rasen, als sie sich wieder in ihrem Bett umdrehte, ihr Atem wurde zu einem Kampf, als sie gegen eine Panikattacke kämpfte, die von ihrem wandernden Verstand bis spät in die Nacht verursacht wurde.<br/><br/>Sie hasste es, sich so schwach zu fühlen, so ängstlich.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Kagome zog sich schließlich aus dem Bett, ihr Zimmer leuchtete mit einem blassen Licht, das ausreichte, um sie ins Badezimmer zu führen. Sie stand vor dem Spiegel, das Waschbecken lief, während sie auf ihr Spiegelbild starrte. Raven färbte Haare bedeckten ihr Gesicht und sie fühlte sich so schlecht, wie sie aussah. Ihr erster Morgen in Elysion war ähnlich, nur war sie in schlechterer Verfassung.<br/><br/>Sie hatte einen platz zum schlafen gefunden und es geschafft, einen deal mit dem eigentümer des gebäudes auszuarbeiten, damit sie eine kleine zeit bleiben konnte, ohne zu bezahlen. Vielleicht war es Mirokus Einfluss gewesen, der es ihr erlaubte, solche Geschäfte zu machen, da der Mönch dafür bekannt war, dass er charmante (oder betrügerische) Menschen dazu brachte, ihnen mehr als genug für die Arbeit zu geben, die sie getan hatten. Der Mönch war schon immer so gewesen, seit sie sich zum ersten Mal getroffen hatten. Er würde behaupten, dass die Wohnung eines Herrn heimgesucht würde, wenn es nicht so war, oder er würde behaupten, dass sie einem Angriff ausgesetzt waren, wenn sie es nicht sein würden. Er würde seine Wards und Reize für so hohe Preise verkaufen. Es funktionierte praktisch jedes mal und sie fragte sich, warum die leute so bereit waren, ihm zu vertrauen.<br/><br/>Vielleicht war es sein Lächeln, oder die Tatsache, dass er ein Mönch war, dass die Menschen der Vergangenheit so bereit waren, zu bröckeln. Er tat immer, was richtig war, und er war ein Symbol der Stärke für sie zu Zeiten, wenn er alles durchdrücken würde, um zu tun, was richtig war. Er drückte die Tatsache durch, dass er im Sterben lag, dass er verflucht war, und versuchte, etwas dagegen zu tun, anstatt sich in seinem Schicksal zu suhlen. Er hatte sich in der Zeit vor ihrem letzten Kampf an die Grenze gedrängt. Und sie war froh gewesen, dass sie Naraku besiegt hatten, bevor er dem gleichen Schicksal unterworfen werden konnte wie sein Vater und sein Vater vor ihm.<br/><br/>Was ihre eigenen Reize angeht, war sie jedoch fairer als ihre Freundin und machte den Deal vernünftig. Sie bezweifelte, dass jeder auf dieser Welt einen hohen Preis für einen Exorzismus oder die Verbannung von Dämonen zahlen würde. Sie waren dafür zu technologisch fortgeschritten. Aber sie war klug genug und klug genug, um ein gutes Geschäft zu machen.<br/><br/>Aber jetzt war Kagome an einem besseren Ort, obwohl der Blick auf ihrem Gesicht gleich aussah. Haunted, müde, drained...<br/><br/>Ein kurzer Blick auf eine Uhr an der Wand sagte ihr, dass sie versuchen könnte, länger zu schlafen. Aber sie lehnte das ab und wollte sich den Rückblenden nicht mehr stellen. Sie duschte stattdessen und benutzte das kalte Wasser, um ihre Dämonen zu vertreiben, um ihre Lungen mit einem scharfen Atemzug zu füllen und sich wach zu machen.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Es hat nicht funktioniert.<br/><br/>Nicht so, wie sie es wollte. Das kalte Wasser zwang die Luft in ihre Lungen, zwang ihren Geist zu erwachen und Muskeln zu ergreifen. Ein bitteres Lachen wurde von ihren Lippen gezogen, als sie ihren Kopf nach hinten neigte und sich an mehr erinnerte. Heute wollte sie ihnen nicht so leicht entkommen, sie wollte sich nicht so einfach erholen, nur weil sie es wollte.<br/><br/>Manchmal kommt man den Gedanken nicht aus dem Weg, die man wollte, selbst wenn man sicher war, dass man an ihnen vorbei war.<br/><br/>Sango wäre in dieser Situation eine große Hilfe gewesen. Der Dämonentöter war ihre beste Freundin, sie würde sogar so weit gehen, sie die Schwester zu nennen, die sie nie hatte. Eine ältere Schwester, die weise war, hatte immer ihre Seite, wenn Schwierigkeiten auftraten. Besonders junge probleme, wenn solche dinge eher trivial waren, aber es machte spaß, sich zu verknallen und für ihre freundin verrückt zu sein, als inuyasha sie traurig machte. Schließlich war es oft so gewesen, dass der Halbdämon an die Seite seines toten Geliebten rannte und ihr mehr als einmal das Herz brach.<br/><br/>Aber Sango inspirierte sie auch auf andere Weise. Nach allem, was die Frau gesehen hatte, war sie immer so stark, so sicher gewesen... Selbst in den Zeiten, in denen sie an sich selbst gezweifelt hatte, zog sie immer durch. Sie bewunderte, dass sie die fähigkeit hatte zu überleben, nachdem sie ihre ganze familie verloren hatte - die erinnerung daran drängte kagome oft zu überleben, weil sie alle auf dieser welt verlor - und dann ihren bruder zu einem bauern von naraku machen ließ. Es war nicht einfach, es hätte nicht etwas sein können, mit dem nur jeder konfrontiert werden konnte und immer noch vorwärts gehen konnte. Sie lächelte immer noch, selbst mit diesem Schmerz und diesen Erinnerungen... Sie war oft so hell, auch in den dunkleren Zeiten.<br/><br/>Und im Moment wollte sie sich in die Seite der älteren Frau lehnen, um Trost in der Tatsache zu finden, dass sie da war und sie unterstützte. Sie hatte das Gefühl, dass Sango das irgendwie durchziehen und einige Worte der Stärke und des Verständnisses anbieten würde. Es waren zeiten wie diese, die diese zaubersprüche verschlimmerten, die ständige erinnerung daran, dass sie ohne ihre familie war.<br/><br/>"Ich will nicht allein sein." Sie schrie laut in ihrer Einsamkeit, das Geräusch der Dusche übertönte das Plädoyer.<br/><br/>Sie hatte keine Angst, es zuzugeben.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Eine weitere Stunde war verstrichen, bevor sie es bemerkt hatte. Ihre Haut war kalt aus dem Wasser und es fühlte sich an, als ob Eis durch ihre Adern lief. Sie hatte nicht bemerkt, dass sie angefangen hatte zu zittern, bis ihre Hand das Wasser ausschaltete und ihre Dusche beendete. Kagome suchte nicht wieder ihren eigenen Blick in den Spiegel, stattdessen wickelte sie sich in Handtücher und stapfte aus dem Badezimmer, die Treppe hinauf und in ihre Küche. Sie begann ein leichtes Frühstück zu machen, untätig durch ihre Notizen für den Tag zu lesen, wie das Essen gekocht.<br/><br/>Ihre Karriere begann in den letzten Jahren. Ihre Fotos wurden in vielen Galerien gezeigt, ihr Name begann, viele Lippen für diejenigen zu besuchen, die sich für Fotografie interessierten.<br/><br/>Die Arbeit, um die sie aus einer Laune heraus gebeten hatte, hatte alles ausgelöst. Sie hatte viel mehr Glück gehabt, als sie erwartet hatte, in dieser Welt zu sein. Niemals das Glück, durch die Risse in ihre eigene Welt zurück zu schlüpfen, aber das Glück, gut zu sein. Als sie zum Ofen zurückkehrte, erinnerte sie sich an die Zeit, die sie schließlich aufgegeben hatte, nach Hause zurückzukehren. Es war ungefähr zwei Jahre in ihrem Leben hier, als sie begonnen hatte, sich in die Fotografie als mehr als nur ein Hobby zu wagen, sondern etwas, mit dem sie sich einen Namen machen konnte.<br/><br/>Dieser Tag war besonders angenehm gewesen, die Sonne war hoch am Himmel und sie hatte sich ein paar Fotos von der natürlichen Landschaft gemacht. Ein kleiner Junge hatte sich in einer der Pflanzen versteckt, und sie hatte ein Bild von dem Moment gemacht, als sich sein Gesicht in ein fröhliches, schelmisches Grinsen eingelebt hatte, bevor er herausgesprungen war, um seine Beute zu erschrecken. Es erinnerte sie an Shippou, das kleine Kitsune, das sie im Wesentlichen adoptiert hatte. Auch er war von seiner Familie gerissen worden, als sie sich zum ersten Mal getroffen hatten. Sein Vater tötete und er war entschlossen, ihn zu rächen. Als er jung war, schien er in ihren ersten Begegnungen so reif zu sein.<br/><br/>Vielleicht war es der Einfluss von Inuyasha, der es dem Kit ermöglichte, sich wieder wie ein Kind zu verhalten, manchmal jung und skurril zu sein, während andere reifer waren. Er tröstete sie auf seine Weise, und sie versuchte, sich um ihn zu kümmern, wie sie es auch tun würde, obwohl sie damals so jung gewesen war. Ihre Jugend hinderte sie jedoch nicht daran, zu verstehen, wie sie sich um ihn kümmern oder wie ihr Kind um ihn kümmern sollte. Ihr Herz schwoll an, als er lächelte, als er so glücklich über sein Geschenk von Buntstiften gewesen war und sich die Zeit nahm, Kunst zu machen. Sie war so stolz auf jede Zeichnung, dass er fertig war, dass sie wusste, dass sich eine Mutter in einer solchen Situation so fühlen würde.<br/><br/>Der Schmerz, der sie durchgerissen hatte, war zu viel, zu plötzlich. Sie vermisste ihn und wollte sehen, wie viel er gewachsen war, seit sie weg war. Sie hatte so viel verpasst...<br/><br/>Um sich weitere Schmerzen, falsche Hoffnungen zu ersparen... gab sie auf und konzentrierte sich darauf, sich selbst zu verbessern.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Das Frühstück schmeckte fad, langweilig und inspiriert. Erst nachdem sie fertig war, erkannte sie, dass sie jede Art von Gewürzen oder Geschmack zum Essen vergessen hatte. Es war jetzt zu spät, um sich daran zu erinnern, da ihr Verstand zu beschäftigt war, sich an andere Details ihres Lebens zu erinnern, die offensichtlich wichtiger geworden waren als ihr Essen.<br/><br/>"Setz dich!"<br/><br/>Natürlich passierte nichts, als sie einen besonders frustrierenden Kunden wütend angeschrien hatte, der sie an den Halbdämon erinnerte. Er war besonders stur und unhöflich. Er wollte ein Foto machen, anstatt es auf natürliche Weise funktionieren zu lassen. Man konnte versuchen, wilde Tiere zu zwingen, sich so zu verhalten, wie man wollte. Aber selten gelang es jemandem mit Gewalt. Inuyasha war jedoch nicht so schlimm. Inuyasha hatte gelernt, bevor sie von ihm weggezwungen worden war. Er war sanfter geworden, verständnisvoller, reifer, obwohl es Zeiten gab, in denen er noch kindisch und übermütig war.<br/><br/>Sie erinnert sich daran, wie rot ihre Wangen verbrannt waren, aber wie sie sich auf den Boden stellte und ihn feuerte. Sie sagte ihm, dass sie sich weigerte, für jemanden oder mit jemandem zu arbeiten, der etwas über seine Natur hinaus verdrehen wollte, über seine eigenen Wünsche hinaus.<br/><br/>Sie hätte den Mann eher mit Naraku als mit Inuyasha vergleichen sollen. Obwohl ihre Klientin nicht so extreme Absichten hatte. Zumindest war das Gefühl danach eine angenehme Erinnerung. Die Freiheit zu wissen, dass sie so weit gekommen war, dass sie Arbeit ablehnen konnte, die sie nicht tun wollte, um ihre eigene Person zu sein, die unabhängig von anderen war. Sie konnte sagen, dass sie es zu diesem Zeitpunkt geschafft hatte. Obwohl sie tage später gerüchte hörte, mit worten, die sie verleumden sollten.<br/><br/>Sie verteidigte sich gerecht, wie sie es gegen Ende ihrer Reise tat, denn sie war die einzige, die sich in dieser Welt schützen konnte.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Morgenlicht begann sich in ihr Haus zu schleichen und erinnerte sie wieder an den Lauf der Zeit. Wieder betrachtete sie die Liste der Dinge, die sie tun musste, und diskutierte darüber, wo sie anfangen sollte. Oder ob sie überhaupt anfangen sollte. Wie der Tag begann, wusste sie nicht, ob sie das für eine großartige Idee halten konnte. Es war zweifelhaft, ob sie damit Erfolg haben würde, wie verloren sie in sich selbst wurde.<br/><br/>Sie wollte ihre neueste Arbeit nicht vermasseln, weil sie das schon ein paar Mal getan hatte. Es war nicht angenehm zu versuchen, sich von einer kompletten Katastrophe zu erholen.<br/><br/>Kagome erinnerte sich an das Gefühl, dass ihre teure, brandneue Kamera aus ihren Händen rutschte. Sie war nicht bereit, sie zu unterstützen, weil sie sie gerade aus ihrer Tasche genommen hatte. Ein Teil von ihr schrie auf der Innenseite. Ein dramatischer, übertriebener, voller Schrei, den sie oft tat, als sie viel, viel jünger war, als sie kämpfte, um es durch die Mittelschule zu schaffen, während sie zwischen den Zeiten hüpfte. Der andere teil von ihr war gefroren geblieben, während ihre linse vollständig zerbrach und der rest der kamera damit gebrochen war.<br/><br/>Als sie sah, wie Inuyashas Bruder, ein voller Dämon, vor ihr stand, war das Letzte, was sie erwartet hatte, als sie sich für ihre Fotos auf den Weg gemacht hatte. Er stand so stolz wie immer, so groß wie immer, so imposant wie sie sich erinnerte. Er sah überhaupt nicht so aus, als wäre er in einer ganz anderen Welt, obwohl sie nie die Beste darin war, seine Gedanken zu lesen. Sein Name auf ihren Lippen war so stark, dass sie sich an die kleinsten Gefühle erinnern konnte. Ihre Lippen waren rissig, ihr Mund fühlte sich trocken an, und das sprudelnde Gefühl der Angst in ihrem Magen machte sie krank.<br/><br/>Sie wollte nicht, dass ihre Hoffnungen aufkamen.<br/><br/>Aber sie wollte, dass er da war, auch wenn sie keine Freunde waren. Sie waren Verbündete, wenn überhaupt, da sie Seite an Seite gekämpft hatten. Und etwas war besser als absolut nichts.<br/><br/>Und Kagome hatte den Sinn genug, sich nicht auf ihn zu werfen, um ihre Arme um ihn zu wickeln. Sie wusste, dass sie nicht allein war. Ihre Kamera spielte keine Rolle mehr, als sie sich ihm näherte. Sie erinnerte sich, dass nichts anderes für tage wichtig war, als sie zeit mit ihm verbrachte, nicht von ihrer welt sprach, sondern sprach (oder sie sprach und er bestätigte diese tatsache einfach).<br/><br/>Als sie sich jedoch genau in ihn verliebte... konnte sich Kagome nicht erinnern. Es war eine subtile Sache, genau wie er. Aber sie wusste, dass das Gefühl da war. Und er ließ sie wissen, dass sie nicht allein in der Tatsache war, dass sie gefallen war, dass Gefühle irgendwie aufgeblüht waren.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Ein Gefühl der Schwerelosigkeit überkam sie und plötzlich öffneten sich ihre Augen, während ihr Verstand verzweifelt nach dem letzten Ding krallte, das sie tat. Sie erinnerte sich nicht, wann sie auf ihrer Couch eingeschlafen war, aber sie wusste, dass der letzte Ort, an dem sie gewesen war, auf den viel zu bequemen Kissen war. Sie kämpfte jedoch nicht oder kämpfte gegen die Schwerelosigkeit, da sie in vertrauten Armen war. Ihr Kopf neigte sich gegen Sesshoumaru's Brust und nahm Trost in der Tatsache, dass er hier war und sie nicht allein war.<br/><br/>"Willkommen zurück." Seine Antwort war ein leises Summen in Anerkennung. Er brauchte nicht viel für sie zu sprechen, um seine Absicht zu verstehen, oder den Rest von dem, was er zu sagen hatte.<br/><br/>Er trug sie zurück zu ihrem Bett, setzte sie mit Leichtigkeit hinein. Ihre Augen trafen auf seine, und sie lächelte leicht, weil keine Erinnerungen mehr zurück drifteten, keine Erinnerungen mehr an sie neckten. Nein, wenn er in der Nähe war, fiel sie nie wieder in diese Gedanken zurück. Er hatte geholfen, und die Jahre hatten geholfen.<br/><br/>"Schlafen." Er befahl mit Leichtigkeit, ihre Augen rollten auf ihn, aber sie kämpfte nicht, weil sie müde war. Ihre Hand klammerte sich fest an ihn, während sie spürte, wie seine gegenüberliegende Hand an ihre Stirn drückte, um ihr Wohlbefinden zu beurteilen.<br/><br/>"Ich bin in Ordnung", sagte sie, ihre Worte fest mit ihrem Versprechen.<br/><br/>Sie war in Ordnung, sie war am Leben, und sie war glücklich.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Verlader<br/><br/>Zusammenfassung<br/><br/>Kagome war an einem Punkt in ihrem Leben ein ziemlich normales Teenager-Mädchen, bis sie von einem Dämon im Brunnenhaus ihrer Familie angegriffen wurde. Der Dämon zog sie in den Brunnen hinunter, was sie magisch etwa 500 Jahre in die Vergangenheit versetzte. Dort erfuhr sie, dass ein heiliges Juwel in ihrem Körper eingeschlossen war, da sie die Reinkarnation einer Priesterin war, die 50 Jahre vor der Zeit, in die sie hineingezogen wurde, gestorben war. Das Juwel wurde aus ihrem Körper gerissen und der Dämon, der sie durch die Zeit zog, wurde von dem Halbdämon besiegt, den sie befreite, der an den Baum geheftet wurde. Kagome freundete sich rechtzeitig mit dem Halbdämon Inuyasha an und reiste mit ihm, um das Juwel wiederherzustellen, das sie selbst zerschmetterte. Obwohl es nicht so einfach und unkompliziert war, so viele Dämonen und Menschen das Juwel für ihre eigenen Zwecke suchten. Sie freundete sich mit einem jungen kitsune-dämon, einem mönch und einem dämonentöter an, der alle mit ihr reiste, um das juwel wiederherzustellen.<br/><br/>Ihre Gruppe war jedoch nicht diejenige, die das Juwel vollendete, sondern ein böser Halbdämon, der die meisten wichtigen Ereignisse im Leben ihres Gefährten manipulierte. Als er schließlich alle Stücke des Juwels sammelte und seinen Wunsch auf dem verdorbenen Gegenstand machte, wurde Kagome in das Juwel selbst mit der Absicht gezogen, dass sie einen selbstsüchtigen Wunsch machte, sie für immer gefangen zu halten und das Juwel am Leben zu erhalten. Es war die Sturheit von Inuyasha, die es schaffte, sie vor der Dunkelheit zu retten. Am Ende kehrte sie in ihre natürliche Zeit zurück und beendete die High School, wie es von einem Mädchen ihrer Zeitlinie erwartet wurde. Obwohl Kagome Tage später in Elysion landete. Sie ist seit fünf Jahren auf dieser Welt und hat es längst aufgegeben, nach Hause zurückzukehren. Sie hat sich glücklich in ihr neues Leben eingelebt.<br/><br/>platonischen<br/><br/>Es ist ziemlich einfach für Kagome, neue Freunde zu finden, sie hat sich seit ihrer Jugend nicht viel verändert. Sie ist eine fröhliche junge Frau, die vor allem in ihrem Leben einfühlsam und einladend ist. In ihrer Jugend freundete sie sich mit Dämonen an, wenn die meisten sie fürchten würden. Sogar Dämonen, die früher Menschen fressen, hat sie sich angefreundet und sie hat ihre Wege geändert (sie würde gerne denken). Es ist wirklich einfach, ihr Freund zu werden, solange jemand in der Lage ist, zu zeigen, dass sie bereit sind, erlöst zu werden, oder zu zeigen, dass sie nicht vollständig böse sind. Sie fühlt sich sehr für jeden, den sie trifft, also ist es schwer für sie, sich nicht zu anderen hingezogen zu fühlen, in dem wunsch, freunde zu sein.<br/><br/>antagonistisch<br/><br/>Der einzige Weg, Kagomes Zorn zu verdienen, ist, so bedauerlich, so böse und so weit jenseits der Erlösung zu sein, dass sie nichts Gutes in dir sehen kann. Und sie kann das Gute in so ziemlich jedem und allem sehen. Ehrlich gesagt, mit wem sie konfrontiert ist? Ein Halbdämon, der zwei Liebende gegeneinander ausspielte, der die gesamte männliche Linie eines ihrer Freunde verfluchte und dann den Bruder ihres besten Freundes ihre Familie töten ließ... Ja, ich sehe nicht, wie sie jemanden hasst, ohne dass sie wirklich dafür arbeiten.

Kagome ist jedoch nicht auf der Suche nach Liebe, war nicht auf der Suche nach Liebe, als sie ankam, so dass keine vergangenen Beziehungen existieren. Das soll nicht heißen, dass sich jemand nicht in sie verliebt hat. Sie kann definitiv Gegenstand der unerwiderten Liebe von jemandem sein, sie wird es wahrscheinlich nicht bemerken.

Ich fühle, dass sie Freunde sein könnten, da Corrin in ihrer Persönlichkeit sehr offen ist und auch sehr vertrauensvoll ist. Sie versteckt sich nur und kämpft sich durch.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Warum Sie auf Twitter sein sollten<br/><br/>Haftungsausschluss: Ich bin kein Social-Media-Guru und habe es auch nie behauptet. Ich bin nur eine Person, die viel über Dinge nachdenkt, und das hat sich mehrmals gezeigt.<br/><br/>Ich bin kein Early Adopter. Manchmal brauche ich Jahre, um herauszufinden, wofür ich etwas verwenden möchte, bevor ich tatsächlich darauf komme, und Twitter war eines dieser Dinge. Ich bin seit etwa Februar dieses Jahres ernsthaft auf Twitter, also bin ich ziemlich neu darin. Trotzdem habe ich eine Reihe von Dingen gelernt und ich wollte sie teilen. Einige Leute sagen, ich bin ein Twitter-Pusher, und ich bin es, weil es viele gute Gründe gibt, darauf zu kommen, und praktisch keine Nachteile.<br/><br/>Also, was ist Twitter? Wenn Sie im Internet sind, haben Sie wahrscheinlich zumindest davon gehört. Es ist ein Social-Media-Netzwerk, das als Forum für Gespräche, Updates und Nachrichten in einem Medium dient, das mehr öffentlich ist als so etwas wie Facebook oder LinkedIn. Bei Facebook geht es darum, wer dich finden will, aber bei Twitter geht es darum, wen du finden willst. Deine Lieblingsautoren, Schauspieler, Politiker, Sänger und Wissenschaftler sind wahrscheinlich auf Twitter. So sind auch deine Lieblings-Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen, Radiosender, Nachrichtenseiten und Geschäfte. Und sie wollen, dass du sie findest und dir anhörst, was sie zu sagen haben. Jeder auf Twitter möchte zumindest anfangs mit dir reden.<br/><br/>Es gibt alle möglichen Gründe, und ich werde Ihnen ein paar nennen.<br/><br/>Twitter ist eine großartige Möglichkeit, sich über Ereignisse zu informieren, die auf der ganzen Welt, aber auch in Ihrer Gemeinde stattfinden. Wenn Sie reisen und nach Aktivitäten suchen, ist dies eine großartige Möglichkeit, sich über Dinge zu informieren, die für Ihre Interessen relevant sind (weil die Menschen, denen Sie folgen, Menschen sind, an denen Sie interessiert sind). Auch wenn Sie nicht reisen, wissen über große Orte, um vor Ort zu gehen oder zu wissen, dass Menschen, die Sie interessiert sind, zu ihnen gehen, schafft eine Gelegenheit, sie zu treffen und eine tiefere Beziehung mit ihnen zu schaffen. Wenn du zu meinem Partypost zurückgehst, all die Leute darin, bis auf zwei, habe ich davon auf Twitter gehört und mich dann im wirklichen Leben getroffen, und jetzt sind wir ziemlich gute Freunde. Und je mehr du das machst, desto mehr Dinge wirst du herausfinden, und desto mehr Leute wirst du treffen. Und wenn Sie ihnen auf Twitter folgen, wissen Sie bereits ein wenig darüber, wie sie sind. Sie wollen es. Das Gegenteil ist auch wahr, denn das Twittern lädt die Leute ein, zu sehen, wie Sie sind, und sie können die gleichen Entscheidungen über Sie treffen.<br/><br/>Inspiration und Motivation<br/>Inspiration kommt von den seltsamsten Orten, und der Zustrom von Tweets bedeutet, dass es immer frische Inhalte für Ihre Vorstellungskraft gibt. Ich habe eine Follow-First-Richtlinie, also werde ich fast jedem folgen und dann regelmäßig durchgehen und die Leute entfolgen. Ich weiß nicht, wer den Samen eines neuen Blogposts oder eines neuen Projekts in mich pflanzen wird, also halte ich meine Optionen offen. Motivation passiert auch, weil Twitter genau wie das Leben ist. Wenn Sie sich mit Menschen umgeben, die ehrgeizig, engagiert, großzügig und fleißig sind, ist es einfacher, so zu sein und sich selbst zu pushen. Es ist einfacher zu denken, dass, wenn sie Veranstaltungen planen, Projekte starten oder einfach nur morgens aufstehen können, gut, so können Sie.<br/><br/>Lern- und Lifestyle-Blogger sind auf Twitter. Blogger, die es nicht sind, sind vielleicht verrückt. Und die Leute bloggen über so ziemlich alles. Wenn du etwas lernen willst, stehen die Chancen gut, dass jemand darüber twittert. Darüber hinaus sind auch Nachrichtendienste und Geschäfte miteinander verbunden, was bedeutet, dass Sie Ihre Nachrichten auf den neuesten Stand bringen und sich über Verkäufe und Angebote informieren können, wenn sie beginnen. Was den Lebensstil betrifft, auf der Suche nach neuen Rezeptideen? Folgen Sie einigen Caterern und sehen Sie, was sie sich einfallen lassen. Brauchen Sie eine Wendung für diese Cocktailparty? Twitter hat auch Leute dafür. Garderobenempfehlungen, oder wollen Sie einfach nur sehen, was andere Leute mit ihrem Leben machen? Es ist alles da.<br/><br/>Es gibt einige häufige Herausforderungen, vor denen ich stehe, wenn ich darüber spreche, und sie sind legitime Hindernisse. Es kann ziemlich entmutigend erscheinen, besonders wenn Sie spät auf den Zug steigen, wie ich es getan habe. Ich habe Monate damit verbracht, nur zwei Leuten zu folgen und nicht zu wissen, was ich sonst noch tun soll. Aber es gibt Möglichkeiten, sie zu überwinden und zu hören, dass sie von den wenigsten bis zu den meisten häufig sind.<br/><br/># 3: Twitter ist für narzisstische Jerks<br/>Ich denke, das kommt von der Idee, dass die meisten Leute für und über sich selbst twittern, um Aufmerksamkeit zu bekommen. Was ich nicht verstehe, ist, warum daran etwas falsch ist oder warum man dadurch zu einem Narzissten oder Idioten wird. Wenn jemand etwas zu sagen hat, will er gehört werden. Früher stand man an der Straßenecke und schrie. Jetzt kann man 140 Zeichen oder weniger schreien. Twitter ist nur eine neue Art, gehört zu werden. Jetzt gibt es sicherlich narzisstische Idioten auf Twitter. Sie sind so ziemlich überall. Manchmal sind die Leute Idioten. Manchmal bin ich einer dieser Leute, tut mir leid zu sagen. Folgen Sie diesen Leuten nicht. Wenn Sie nicht mögen, was jemand sagt, ob das Punkte sind, die sie machen, oder detaillierte Berichte über ihre Badezimmeraktivitäten, müssen Sie nicht auf Twitter hören.<br/><br/>#2: Ich kann nicht alles im Auge behalten<br/>Das zweite Hindernis, das die Leute oft aufwerfen, ist, dass sie einfach keine Zeit haben, um all die Dinge zu verfolgen, die auf Twitter vor sich gehen. Und weißt du was? Das ist in Ordnung. Behalten Sie im Auge, was Sie können. Vielleicht wandern Sie nur alle paar Tage. Wenn Sie ein privater Benutzer sind (und nicht für Ihr Unternehmen twittern), und vor allem ein Anfänger, ist das in Ordnung. Ein Teil von etwas ist besser als alles von nichts.<br/><br/># 1 Ich habe nichts, was ich da rausbringen möchte<br/>Dies ist bei weitem die häufigste Herausforderung, die Menschen aufwerfen. Und es spielt keine Rolle. Sie müssen sich nicht bei Twitter anmelden, um zu sprechen. Schließen Sie sich an, um zuzuhören. Auch hier sind Ihre Lieblingsautoren, Sänger, Blogger und Zeitungen zu sehen. Dies ist Ihre Chance, ihnen zuzuhören. Es ist Ihre Chance, ein Fenster in ihr Leben und ihre Aktivitäten zu bekommen, und sie laden Sie dazu ein. Möchten Sie herausfinden, was Felicia Day auf der San Diego Comic Con machen wird? Fertig. Ich kenne Leute, die nur auf Twitter zuhören, und das ist großartig. Das habe ich eine Weile getan. Irgendwann wirst du vielleicht etwas finden, worüber du twittern kannst, oder etwas, worüber du twittern kannst. Ich hoffe, du tust es, weil ich davon hören möchte.<br/><br/>Kurz gesagt, wenn Sie Twitter nicht verwenden, denke ich, sollten Sie es tun. Wenn Sie es nicht in vollem Umfang verwenden, versuchen Sie es. Haben Sie keine Angst, fünfhundert Leuten zu folgen, wenn all diese Leute Dinge sagen, an denen Sie interessiert sind. Laden Sie diese Leute in Teile Ihres Lebens ein und sehen Sie, wie es durch die Interaktion verbessert wird. Ich freue mich darauf, von Ihnen zu hören. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Wurzelkanäle<br/><br/>Der Gedanke, einen Wurzelkanal zu bekommen, bringt die meisten Menschen auf den Punkt. SCM Dental verwendet die neueste Technologie und Technik, um einen Wurzelkanal zu einem nahezu schmerzfreien und stressarmen Verfahren zu machen.<br/><br/>Rotary Endodontie ist eine fortschrittliche Technologie und Technik, um endodontische Behandlung durchzuführen, der klinische Begriff für einen WurzelkanalDer Begriff "Wurzelkanal" bezieht sich auf die natürliche Höhle in der Mitte des Zahnes. Der Nerv des Zahnes befindet sich im Weichgewebe (Zahnpulp) innerhalb des Wurzelkanals. Wenn der Zahn entweder durch Trauma oder Karies beschädigt wird, können Ablagerungen in den empfindlichen Wurzelkanalbereich gelangen und eine Infektion oder unter extremen Umständen und Abszess verursachen. Ein Abszesszahn ist sehr ernst und sollte als Notfall behandelt werden, da er eine Infektion verursachen kann, die sich auf andere Teile des Körpers ausbreiten kann. Wenn Sie glauben, dass Sie einen Abszesszahn haben, wenden Sie sich sofort an unser Büro, um eine Notfallversorgung zu vereinbaren.<br/><br/>Je nach Fall kann die Wurzelkanaltherapie mehr als einen Besuch erfordern. Eine erste Röntgenaufnahme wird durchgeführt, um den Zahn und den Wurzelkanal zu bewerten und das Ausmaß der Beschädigung und Infektion zu bestimmen, falls vorhanden. Sie erhalten eine Form der Anästhesie, um sich zu entspannen.<br/><br/>Wenn der Bereich taub ist, erstellt unser Zahnarzt mit einem elektrischen Handstück eine Zugangskammer zum Wurzelkanal. Als nächstes wird der Wurzelkanal des infizierten oder beschädigten Gewebes und Nervs abgeschabt. Sobald der gesamte Bereich gründlich gereinigt und poliert wurde, wird der Zahn mit einer biokompatiblen Gummimischung namens Gutta percha gefüllt. Der Zahn wird dann mit einer Zahnfüllung oder Zahnkrone bedeckt, um Stärke und Funktion wiederherzustellen.<br/><br/>Die endodontische Therapie hat einen schlechten Ruf als schmerzhaftes Verfahren. Bei der Rotationsendodontie ist ein Wurzelkanalverfahren nicht schmerzhafter als eine Zahnfüllung. Die Infektion und Schädigung des Nervs ist das, was die extremen Schmerzen und Beschwerden verursacht, und die Patienten werden nach einer Wurzelkanaltherapie eine signifikante Linderung erfahren. Wurzelkanäle haben eine Erfolgsquote von 95% und ermöglichen es den Menschen, ihre natürlichen Zähne zu erhalten. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Boden Holz<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Ferienunterkunfts-Inbox Suchen Highgate, Highgate<br/><br/>Jetzt Queen's Wood genannt<br/><br/>Zwischen 1860 und 1880 wurde das Zentrum aus der City of London gerissen, um Kanalisationen, Eisenbahnen und neue Straßen zu bauen. Häuser wurden abgerissen, ohne Rücksicht auf die Mieter, die anderswo jede Unterkunft finden mussten. Manager gingen nach Kensington und St. John's Wood, während die Ärmsten sich in die Rookeries wie Seven Dials und Lisson Grove drängten. Für die dazwischen, die Schreiber und geschickte Arbeiter, spekulative Bauherren aufstellen Reihe nach Reihe von Reihenhäusern und Herr Pooter zog in Holloway. Die Leute von Muswell Hill beobachteten, wie Häuser über die Felder von Finsbury Park, den Crouch Hill und die andere Seite hinunter kriechen, so dass 1880 Crouch End entwickelt wurde und es keine Möglichkeit gab, den Fluss einzudämmen. Zehn Jahre später wurden die großen Anwesen von Muswell Hill verkauft. Upton Farm wurde verkauft und die kirchlichen Kommissare wollten Churchyard Bottom Wood, jetzt Queen's Wood genannt, entwickeln. Die Geschichte hätte ein Ibsen-Spiel gemacht. Zwei Gruppen von ehrlichen, hochmotivierten Menschen, die für das kämpfen, was sie für richtig hielten. Die kirchlichen Kommissare auf der einen Seite und das Komitee der Hornsey Charities auf der anderen, beide glaubten, dass sie ihr Bestes für andere Menschen taten, und die Öffentlichkeit erhob sich gegen sie beide in Empörung.<br/><br/>Zu dieser Zeit war die Muswell Hill Road eine Landstraße mit Southwood Hall an einem Ende und Upton Farm am anderen Ende. 1894 wurde Onslow Gardens gebaut, Connaught Gardens markiert und die Bauherren waren bereit, das Woodlands-Anwesen zu entwickeln. Ausgeschnitten von Churchyard Bottom Wood war eine Gruppe heruntergekommener Cottages auf einem dreieckigen Gelände. Eine undatierte Karte, die von den kirchlichen Kommissaren gehalten wird, zeigt sechs Wasteland Cottages mit einer Öffnung zwischen ihnen - keine Straße, nicht metallisiert, sondern einen Weg zu den Erdbeerbetten dahinter. Weiter entlang führte eine weitere Lücke zu Fußwegen durch das Holz. Diese beiden Öffnungen sollten die Grundlage des Plans sein. Die gleichen zwei Lücken und der geräumte Boden, das Erdbeerfeld, sind auf der Karte von 1894 zu sehen. Sie werden als "Muswell Hill Cottages" gezeigt und ganz nebenbei war Peter Sellers viel später auf der gleichen Seite zu leben. Um das Holz als Wohnsiedlung zu entwickeln, mussten die Kommissare zwei Straßen von der Muswell Hill Road durchfahren und Häuser entlang ihnen bauen. Die Muswell Hill Road Fassade allein hätte nicht genügend Platz für Häuser zur Verfügung gestellt, um das Unternehmen lohnenswert zu machen.<br/><br/>Das Land und die Hütten waren viel früher als Almosenhäuser für alte Leute gegeben worden und wurden in ihrem Namen von den Treuhändern der Hornsey Charity Commissioners gehalten. Öffentlich gesinnt, um das Beste für ihre alten Mieter zu tun, konnten die Treuhänder sie nicht verbessern, da sie kein Geld hatten. Einige Jahre bevor die kirchlichen Kommissare geplant hatten, Kiesgrubenholz (heute Highgate Wood) als Wohnsiedlung zu entwickeln, war dies jedoch auf solchen Widerstand gestoßen, dass sie sich zurückzogen. Stattdessen gaben sie 1886 alle 69 Hektar Wald der Öffentlichkeit. Zur gleichen Zeit boten sie an, Churchyard Bottom Wood für 25.000 Pfund an den Hornsey Urban District Council zu verkaufen, aber das war zu viel für Hornsey, um es alleine aufzuziehen. Der Rat sagte, daß die Menschen, die außerhalb von Hornsey lebten, auch das Holz genossen, und andere Behörden sollten helfen, aber es wurde keine Hilfe gegeben.<br/><br/>Karte, die die Muswell Hill Cottages zeigt, die das Zentrum der Kontroverse waren.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road um 1880<br/><br/>Es scheint wahrscheinlich, dass diese drei Paare von Hütten waren diejenigen, die im Mittelpunkt des Streits.<br/><br/>Die kirchlichen Kommissare wollten Geld für ihre kirchliche Arbeit in Großbritannien und im Ausland sammeln. Sie waren der Ansicht, dass ihnen das Land gegeben worden war, das für die Propogation der Religion verwendet werden sollte, und wenn dies den Verkauf von Land oder Wäldern bedeutete, war es ein geringeres Übel, als die Arbeit der Kirche einzuschränken. Sie hatten Gravel Pit Wood der Öffentlichkeit gegeben: An seiner Stelle würden sie Churchyard Bottom Wood entwickeln.<br/><br/>Die Trustees der Hornsey Charities wollten ein Einkommen erzielen, um ihren armen Leuten zu helfen, also machten sie den Commissioners ein Angebot. Ihr dreieckiges Stück Land war zu unbeholfen geformt, um wirtschaftlich entwickelt zu werden, aber wenn die Kommissare ihnen etwas mehr Land gewähren würden, um es zu einem quadratischen Standort zu machen, würden sie fünfundzwanzig ordentliche Villen bauen. Die Kommission ist der Ansicht, daß die Kommission in der Lage sein wird, eine Reihe von Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um die Arbeitslosigkeit zu verringern, und daß die Kommission in der Lage sein wird, die Arbeitslosigkeit zu verringern und die Arbeitslosigkeit zu verringern.<br/><br/>Als dieses Angebot bekannt wurde, reagierten die Menschen sofort mit Alarm.<br/><br/>Am 16. Dezember 1893 fragte der Abgeordnete Carvell Williams im House of Commons, ob die kirchlichen Kommissare zugestimmt hätten, einen Landstreifen an die Hornsey Charities Trustees zu verkaufen, unter der Bedingung, dass eine bestehende Straße auf 40 Fuß erweitert wird, ob dies ein Vorentwurf für ein Bauprogramm sei und ob das House of Parliament die Möglichkeit hätte, eine Meinung zu äußern.<br/><br/>Herr Leveson Gower, ein Kommissar für Kirchenstände, antwortete: "Ja" zum ersten Teil.<br/><br/>Mr. Carvell Williams: "Verstehe ich, dass es die Absicht ist, diesen Teil von Highgate Woods zu zerstören, indem man darauf baut?"<br/><br/>Zwei Tage später veröffentlichte The Star einen Artikel, der jeder modernen Boulevardzeitung würdig ist.<br/><br/>Der Star<br/>18. Dezember 1893<br/><br/>Das Parlament muß die alten Vandalen und Konföderierten der Predigerkommissare genau im Auge behalten, die immer ein Stück Land entfremden oder die Bauleute gegenüber der breiten Öffentlichkeit bevorzugen. Die Kommissare würden das Churchyard Bottom-Holz nicht an die Steuerzahler verkaufen, sondern schlagen jetzt vor, "es zu öffnen", indem sie zwei breite Straßen im Zusammenhang mit einem ihrer zahlreichen Bauvorhaben durchschneiden. Wird nicht jemand im Parlament eine Frage stellen und die Politik der Kommissare überprüfen?<br/><br/>Als dies gedruckt wurde, war die Frage gestellt worden und die Antwort war entweder unwahr oder hinterhältig. Andere Papiere nahmen die Geschichte auf. Die Times sagte in einem langen Bericht, dass die Kommissionsmitglieder nicht bereit seien, sich zu verpflichten, dass das Parlament oder eine andere öffentliche Stelle die Möglichkeit haben sollte, jede Art von Bauplan auf dem Gelände des Holzes in Betracht zu ziehen.<br/><br/>Die Situation schwelgte achtzehn Monate lang, bis die kirchlichen Kommissare gezwungen waren, eine Untersuchung einzuleiten, die am 31. Mai 1895 in Highgate unter dem Vorsitz eines stellvertretenden kirchlichen Kommissars begann. Die Untersuchung brachte eine Flut von Zeitungsbriefen hervor, von denen dies die wichtigste war.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle vom 5. Juni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMUS BEI HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Werden Sie uns helfen, eine Katastrophe abzuwehren, die nicht nur für den unmittelbaren Bezirk, sondern für den gesamten dicht besiedelten Norden Londons eine Katastrophe wäre? In keinem Teil der Metropole war der Bauherr aktiver als in Crouch End und Hornsey. Die schönen Wiesen von vor ein oder zwei Jahren sind jetzt Häuser und Geschäfte. Ballasthaufen haben den Platz von stattlichen Ulmen und Kastanien eingenommen, und einst angenehme Dörfer teilen das Schicksal von Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury und Islington.<br/><br/>---- Das Objekt ist der Bau von zwei vierzig-Fuß-Straßen durch den Wald. Wir in diesem Bezirk kennen die Bedeutung von vierzig-Fuß-Straßen durch den Wald. Es bedeutet, dass der Wald zum Scheitern verurteilt ist. Vor zehn Jahren Agitation rettete die Schwester-Holz von fünfundsechzig Acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - und niemand, der die Bank Holiday Massen strömen die Archway Road von den tristen Straßen von Holloway, Islington und Clerkenwell sah, und beobachtete die scharfe Freude der Kinder und Familienfeste Picknick auf dem Gras und unter den Bäumen, konnte es versäumen, den immensen Segen zu erkennen, dass die Gewährung durch die Ecclesias Wood hat die ganze North Commissionäre von London. ----<br/><br/>Die Ecclesiastical Commissioners besitzen fast ein Drittel der großen Pfarrei von Hornsey. Durch die liberalen Ausgaben der Zinszahlergelder bei der Straßeneröffnung und der allgemeinen Entwicklung des Kreises ist der Wert ihres Eigentums enorm gestiegen, und aus diesem unverdienten Zuwachs ziehen sie jedes Jahr große Einnahmen. Sicherlich können die Steuerzahler, deren Geld so bei der Schaffung des immensen Nachlasses geholfen hat, im Gegenzug eine liberale Behandlung erwarten.<br/><br/>Dein Gehorsam,<br/><br/>Unterzeichnet vom Vikar von St. James, Muswell Hill, dem Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, einem in Onslow Gardens lebenden Anwalt und drei Mitgliedern des Bezirksrates.<br/><br/>Es war ein Schuss direkt über die Bögen der kirchlichen Kommissare. Ihre eigenen religiösen Führer und der Bezirksrat, alle in den Armen sagen in der Tat, dass die Kirche zu reich war und sollte wohltätig sein, nicht gierig. Die Einbeziehung der beiden Geistlichen war ein kluger Schachzug. Denken Sie daran, dass dies noch auf dem Höhepunkt der Darwin-Kontroverse war. Darwin hatte den Glauben an die Lehren der Kirche gespalten, und viele Menschen hätten die Macht der Kirche allein von diesem Standpunkt aus geärgert.<br/><br/>Die Abendnachrichten vom 7. Juni 1895 sagten:<br/><br/>"Wenn die kirchlichen Kommunisatoren nicht sofort in Angriff genommen werden, wird der Baukrake einen Griff des Holzes bekommen, das später sehr schwer zu lösen sein wird, ---. Daher ist es die Pflicht der Londoner, aufzustehen und etwas zu tun, wenn sie eine ihrer schönsten rustikalen Landschaften retten würden. Die öffentliche Untersuchung wird auf Donnerstag vertagt, und vorher muss etwas getan werden, um die Kommissare davon zu überzeugen, dass die Bürger Londons die Beschlagnahme eines ihrer Lieblingsspielplätze nicht tolerieren werden.<br/><br/>Ein Brief in der Daily Chronicle am nächsten Tag sagte:<br/><br/>.... Es war mit großer Erleichterung, dass die Bewohner vor etwa zehn Jahren hörten, dass der Kauf des Oberwaldes erfolgt war; und wie herrlich ein Segen dies bewiesen hat, jeder, der sie besuchte, kann bezeugen, aber alle, die sich bemühten, diese oberen Wälder zu retten, die auf der Westseite der Muswell Hill Road liegen, fühlten, dass ihr Sieg unvollständig war, solange die sechzig Morgen auf der Ostseite in Gefahr blieben. Es ist sozusagen ein Zufall, dass der Wald durch eine breite Hauptstraße geteilt wird. Kann jemand bezweifeln, was die Wirkung wäre, wenn der Friedhof Bodenholz durch Reihen von kleinen Villen ersetzt würde, die jeweils ihren Beitrag von Rauch und Ruß aussenden? Kann jemand auch den ernsten Unterschied bezweifeln, den es in der malerischen Umgebung des gekauften Waldes machen würde, wenn eine Reihe von starrenden neuen Häusern direkt vor ihre grüne Fassade geführt würde? "<br/><br/>Dies drückte die Meinungen vieler Menschen aus. In der Tat war der Kiesgrubenwald, den der Schriftsteller den "Oberen Wald" nennt, nicht gekauft worden, sondern dem Bezirk von der Kirchlichen Kommission gegeben worden, ein Punkt, den sie im Laufe der Jahre immer wieder wiederholen sollten, aber die meisten Leute ignorierten es. Die Kommission wollte kein zweites Holz verschenken, was auch immer jemand gesagt hat, und hielt diese Position bis zum Ende.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain von 5 Cranley Gardens drängte in einem Brief an die Times vom 8. Juni 1895 auf den Kauf.<br/><br/>Ich weiß, dass es üblich ist, hart von den kirchlichen Kommissaren zu sprechen, aber als Treuhänder eines Fonds sind sie verpflichtet, es zum größten Vorteil zu verwalten, und daher, wenn etwas getan werden soll, um den Abriss des Holzes zu retten, scheint es mir, dass es nur durch den Kauf des Eigentums von den Comnussioners durchgeführt werden kann, die ich kenne, sind voll lebendig zum Schutz der freien und offenen Räume für die Menschen,<br/><br/>(Dies bezieht sich auf die Crouch End Playing Fields, die einige Jahre später gesichert worden waren.)<br/><br/>Als Vorsitzender der Muswell Hill Conservative Association stehe ich ständig in Kontakt mit den Einwohnern, und ich kann mit Sicherheit bestätigen, dass jede Person, die in der Nachbarschaft wohnt, alles tun würde, um sie zu erhalten.<br/><br/>(Alles, was er persönlich wollte, war wohltätiges Einkommen, um seine armen Leute zu unterstützen. Er verlangte seinen Morgen Land - nicht viel sicher - er glaubte die Versicherung der Kommissare, dass das Holz nicht in Gefahr war.)<br/><br/>"Muswell Hill Road war eine der besten in Hornsey und würde gleich schön bleiben, Häuser oder keine Häuser."<br/><br/>(Und dann kam die große rhetorische Blüte.)<br/><br/>Sind die Armen wegen der sentimentalen Einwände und des hysterischen Schreis des Wolfs, den Ihre Korrespondenten gerade erhoben haben, zu leiden? Ein Hektar Hinterland, das dem Wohltätigkeitsgrundstück hinzugefügt wird, würde für das verbleibende Land keinen spürbaren Unterschied machen, während der daraus erzielte Gewinn vielen armen alten und verdienstvollen Personen in ihren rückläufigen Jahren helfen und es uns ermöglichen würde, unseren Nachfolgern einen Nachlass zu übergeben, der in ferner Zukunft von großem Wert wäre bei der Bereitstellung von wohltätiger Hilfe für die verdienstvollen Armen der Gemeinde Hornsey. "<br/><br/>Wenn man seinen Brief liest, spürt man eine Hysterie ganz in der Nähe der Oberfläche. Warum dachten die Kommissare, sie wollten eine Straße bauen? Warum sollten sie all das Geld ausgeben, wenn nicht, um Häuser zu bauen? Er schien nie zu erkennen, dass für einen Morgen Land das ganze Holz verloren gehen würde, aber er hatte das Problem schon lange. Er war die Person, der die Kommissare das Angebot zum Verkauf für £ 25.000 Jahre zuvor gemacht hatte, und es ist sein Name, der in einer Plakette auf Crouch End Clock Tower für die Rettung des Holzes geehrt wird, aber sein Vertrauen in die kirchlichen Kommissare scheint naiv. Es ist traurig, dass er bei der Untersuchung als Teufel geworfen werden sollte.<br/><br/>Die Untersuchung wurde fortgesetzt<br/><br/>Die Vertagung wurde am 15. Juni 1895 in Highgate eröffnet. In Erwartung einer großen Versammlung war die Ratskammer vollständig verändert worden. Die üblichen Tische waren entfernt und der Raum mit Stühlen gefüllt worden. Um halb sieben war der Raum überfüllt, und die Leute drängten sich um Sitze.<br/><br/>Herr Murray, der Kommissar, sagte, die Untersuchung sei wirklich eine einfache: Hornsey Parochial Charities wollte ein Stück Land neben ihrem Wohltätigkeitseigentum auf der Rückseite kaufen. Die Frage war, ob die Wohltätigkeitskommission, die alle Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen kontrollierte, genug Macht hatte, sie zu stoppen. Die Beauftragten der Kirche waren bereit, das Land zu sehr günstigen Bedingungen zu verkaufen, und das Einkommen der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation würde sehr beträchtlich erhöht werden.<br/><br/>Dagegen gab es drei Klassen von Einwänden.<br/><br/>Der ursprüngliche Trust diente der Bereitstellung von Häusern für die Armen, aber die Treuhänder schlugen vor, Villen zu bauen, die für die Armen zu teuer wären. Es lag jedoch in der Macht der Treuhänder, die Bedingungen des Trusts zu ändern, so dass sie Villen bauen konnten, wenn sie dachten, dass die Armen am Ende davon profitieren würden. Die armen Leute selbst mögen einwenden, aber liberale Bestimmungen waren ihnen bereits versprochen worden. Der dritte Einwand bezog sich auf die ästhetische und öffentliche Seite der Frage. Er nahm es aus dem, was er gelesen hatte, dass die Wohltätigkeitskommission eingreifen sollte, um die kirchlichen Kommissare daran zu hindern, ihr eigenes Ermessen im Umgang mit ihrem eigenen Eigentum auszuüben.<br/><br/>Die Untersuchung erörterte die Einzelheiten, aber die Redner kamen immer wieder auf das Hauptproblem zurück, die Zerstörung des Holzes zu verhindern. Der Vestry Clerk von Islington, der 300.000 Menschen repräsentierte, protestierte formell gegen einen Teil des Holzes, der für die Menschen in Islington und Hornsey so wertvoll ist, dass er für private Zwecke verwendet wurde. Wilfred White sagte, wenn die Kommissare ihnen Zeit geben würden, könnten sie das Geld aufbringen, um die Treuhänder zu entschädigen.<br/><br/>Herr Beaumont sagte, sie wollten keine Villen, sie wollten Cottages für arme Leute, die aus dem Bezirk vertrieben wurden. Andere sagten, dass es kein Geld gäbe, um Häuser zu bauen, um die heutigen zu ersetzen, aber Villen wären ein wirtschaftlicher Vorschlag. Andere erwiderten, dass es eine Reihe von Villen gäbe, um Highgate zu betreten. Der Wald war heilig. Bleiben Sie bei der Frage nach dem Holz.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher sagte, der Schrei unter den Werktätigen sei, dass es nirgendwo hingehen könne. Werktätige kamen mit dem Schrei zu ihm: "Wir werden aus Highgate vertrieben und sind verpflichtet, nach Highgate New Town zu gehen." Wenn die Muswell Hill Road Fassade verkauft wurde, gab es keine Frage, aber dass Straßen direkt durch den Wald in Richtung Hornsey geschnitten werden könnten, aber wenn die Kommissare das Land nicht von der Wohltätigkeitskommission bekommen konnten, konnten sie die Straße nicht schneiden.<br/><br/>Er war sich sehr sicher, dass die Hütten in einen geeigneten Reparaturzustand versetzt werden konnten. Er wurde von den armen Leuten, von der Polizei und von einer Reihe von Arbeitern gebeten, diese beiden Punkte zu vertreten, dass Cottage-Unterkunft in Highgate sehr dringend benötigt wurde und dass, wenn sie einmal erlaubten, das Land zu verkaufen, es keine Ahnung gab, wo die Hand des Erbauers bleiben würde.<br/><br/>(Laute und langanhaltende Jubelrufe).<br/><br/>Zahlreiche andere Leute sprachen und der Comnussioner fasste zusammen, indem er sagte, er sei der Meinung, dass die vorherrschende Meinung für die Beibehaltung der Hütten sei, aber die Versammlung sollte keine Schlussfolgerungen aus dem ziehen, was er gesagt hatte (Groans).<br/><br/>Andere sagten, dass die Treuhänder der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation in ihren Pflichten versagt hätten, indem sie die Hütten verfallen ließen.<br/><br/>Herr H.R. Williams, der Treuhänder, der zuvor an die Zeitung geschrieben hatte, sagte, dass er es unter der besten Autorität habe, dass die Kirchenkommissare überhaupt keine Straßen machen würden und dass sie nicht von den Aktionen der Wohltätigkeitskommissare profitieren würden. Andere waren weit weniger vertrauensvoll und das Treffen schloss nach fast drei Stunden.<br/><br/>Wir sind mit der Tatsache konfrontiert, dass es in Highgate und Muswell Hill eine Reihe von Personen gibt, die den Churchyard Bottom Wood wollen und nicht glücklich sein werden, bis sie ihn bekommen haben - während niemand bereit zu sein scheint, einen Farthing auszugeben, um dafür zu bezahlen. Jeder sagt, es wäre eine feine Sache, das Holz als offenen Raum zu haben, aber jeder denkt, es sei die Pflicht eines anderen, es zu einem zu machen. Die Islington Vestry hat sich zu diesem Thema "entschlossen", aber die Islington Vestry bietet kein Penny-Stück für den Kauf an. "Es gibt kein schwierigeres Problem für die Gemeinschaft oder das Individuum zu lösen, als wie man das Eigentum anderer Leute in Besitz nimmt, ohne dafür zu bezahlen."<br/><br/>Die Kosten dafür waren in der Tat das Problem, da Churchyard Bottom Wood Gegenstand intensiver lokaler und nationaler Debatten wurde. Ein gemeinsames Komitee wurde gebildet, um Geld zu sammeln, um das Holz zu retten. Am 20. November 1896 wurde C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, schrieb an The Standard, eine damalige Tageszeitung, die um Hilfe bat. Er erinnerte alle an die Gefahr, das Holz zu verlieren, und sagte, es könne nur durch den Kauf gerettet werden. Die Kirchenkommissare würden für 25.000 Pfund und einen zusätzlichen Preis verkaufen (5.000 wären für das Fechten und die Entwässerung erforderlich, was insgesamt 30.000 Pfund entspricht. Die Wälder waren von unschätzbarem Wert für ganz Nord-London, so appellierte er an öffentliche Stellen und Privatpersonen, die verbleibenden 20.000 Pfund zu erhöhen. Er warnte, dass das vorliegende Angebot der Kirchenkommissare erst Ende 1898 offen war. Danach würden die Bauherren einziehen.<br/><br/>Der Aufruf wurde von der Presse sehr begrüßt. Eine Privatrechnung wurde durch das Parlament gehetzt und der Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, wurde Gesetz. Das Conunittee hatte nun das Recht, für Beiträge zum Kauf und zur Erhaltung des Holzes zu werben.<br/><br/>In relativ kurzer Zeit wurde fast das gesamte Geld aufgebracht, aber die letzten paar Tausend waren sehr schwierig zu beschaffen, und die Frist für die Kommissionsmitglieder war eine Frage von Wochen. Herr Cory-Wright schrieb für mehr Zeit plädieren, wurde aber nur drei Monate gewährt und dann nur, wenn Zinsen von 4 Prozent für die zusätzliche Zeit auf den vollen Betrag bezahlt wurde. Am Ende machte der London County Council, der ursprünglich 2.500 Pfund angeboten hatte, dies auf 5.000 Pfund und die Summe wurde erreicht, aber es war eine enge Sache.<br/><br/>Der Rat beschloss, den Wald zu Ehren von Königin Victorias Diamond Jubilee in "Queen's Woods" umzubenennen, und Hornsey zeigte eine feine Bunting-Darbietung, als die Herzogin von Albany den Wald offiziell für "für die freie Nutzung der Öffentlichkeit für immer" erklärte.<br/><br/>Während die Kampagne zur Rettung von Churchyard Bottom Wood von Einheimischen geleitet und geleitet wurde, die sich leidenschaftlich für dieses besondere Stück Wald interessierten, riefen sie die Hilfe und Erfahrung eines riesigen Netzwerks von Menschen auf, von denen einige seit über dreißig Jahren an ähnlichen Kampagnen zusammengearbeitet hatten. Der Ausschuss veröffentlichte einen Appell, der auf sehr gutem Papier gedruckt war und einige berühmte Namen trug.<br/><br/>Die Fragen des offenen Raums und der öffentlichen Gesundheit waren Hauptthemen der viktorianischen Vision.<br/><br/>Die Open Spaces Bewegung<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, der große Wohnungsreformer, der mit drei alten Häusern in Marylebone begonnen hatte, die Jolm Ruskin für sie gekauft hatte, war schnell zu einem Experten für die Unterbringung armer Menschen unter den gesündesten Bedingungen geworden. Ihr Weg war, Pachtverträge zu kaufen und dann einige der überfüllten Häuser niederzuschlagen, um Licht und Luft zum Rest zu bringen, da sie glaubten, dass frische Luft und Sonnenlicht der einzige Weg seien, um arme Menschen vor dem "trockenen Fieber" zu retten. Sie hatte dies als Kind von ihrem Großvater Southwood Smith gelernt, der seine Theorien im Fever Hospital am King's Cross entwickelte.<br/><br/>Er hatte die ersten industriellen Wohnungen für arme Leute gebaut und hatte statistisch bewiesen, dass gute Luft und anständige Entwässerung Leben retteten. Gibson Gardens in der Northwold Road ist ein direktes Ergebnis von Southwood Smiths Ideen. Mehr Informationen über Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Die Bedeutung von Open Air<br/><br/>Freiräume und die Möglichkeit, saubere Luft zu atmen, waren für die Menschen in einem oder zwei überfüllten Räumen unerlässlich. Octavia Hill nahm ihre Ladungen von den Lisson Grove Slums, die Fitzjohn's Avenue hinauf nach Hampstead Heath. Sie liebte die Felder der Fitzjohn's Avenue so sehr, dass sie versuchte, sie als öffentlichen Park zu kaufen. Sie sollten £ 10.000 kosten und innerhalb von drei Augustwochen waren £ 8.500 gesammelt worden. Es brauchte nur das Ende der Sommerferien und die Rückkehr aus dem Urlaub von sympathischen Freunden und die weiteren 1.500 Pfund wären aufgebracht worden, aber die Besitzer zogen plötzlich ihr Angebot zurück. Trotz aller Bitten waren die Felder mit großen Häusern bedeckt.<br/><br/>Daraus entwickelte sich die Kampagne, um Parliament Hill, den nächsten offenen Raum nördlich von Lisson Grove, zu retten, und kaufte Felder auf dem Weg der Bauherren, um eine permanente Schnur gegen die vorrückenden Ziegelsteine zu machen. Die Parliament Hill Fields Kampagne war so erfolgreich, dass die Hampstead Heath Bill verabschiedet wurde und es Geld von der Berufung gab. Aus diesem Geld und dem Impuls in Richtung Freiräume sollte der National Trust entwickelt werden. Octavia Hill war seit Jahren daran interessiert, Gebiete wie Church Bottom Wood zu schützen, also war sie eine natürliche Verbündete im Kampf um die Rettung des Waldes.<br/><br/>Auch die Commons Preservation Society war mit dieser Art von Agitation und Geldsammlung vertraut. Sie hatten Fechten abgerissen, als Herren des Herrenhauses Stücke von gemeinsamem Land eingeschlossen hatten, sowohl legale als auch illegale Kämpfe gegen die arrogante Privatisierung von Land traditionell frei führend. Robert Hunter, ihr Ehrenanwältin von 1868, war immer daran interessiert, große oder kleine Freiräume für die Öffentlichkeit zu sichern. Er, jetzt Sir Robert Hunter, wurde Vorsitzender des Church Bottom Appeal. Der Vorsitzende der Commons Preservation Society war Herr Shaw-Lefevre MP (später Lord Eversley), der eine große Rolle in dieser und anderen Kampagnen im House of Commons spielte. Octavia Hill war seit etwa 1875 an ihrer Arbeit beteiligt.<br/><br/>Gleichzeitig setzte sich Octavia Hill für ein Bestattungsgesetz ein.<br/><br/>Stadtfriedhöfe waren so voll geworden und eine so ernste Gefahr für die Gesundheit, indem Brunnen verunreinigt wurden, aus denen die Menschen ihr Trinkwasser schöpften, dass Stadtbestattungen nicht mehr erlaubt waren. Stattdessen wurden Friedhöfe am Stadtrand geschaffen. Abney Park Cemetary war einer von ihnen. Es gab dann eine Bewegung, um die Grabsteine an den Rändern der Altstadt Cemetries zu entfernen, re-inter die Körper anderswo und verwandeln die Cemetries in Gärten und Freiflächen, anstatt auf ihnen zu bauen. Dieses Land im Zentrum von London war sehr wertvoll und Spekulanten waren begierig darauf, es zu erhalten: Sogar die Quäker hatten über einem ihrer Friedhöfe gebaut und drohten, dies durch den Bau über Bunhill Fields wieder zu tun. Octavia Hill hatte ein Netzwerk von Verbündeten in einem Dutzend Feldern, so dass ihre Hilfe zur Rettung der Church Bottom Wood von unschätzbarem Wert gewesen sein muss.<br/><br/>Die 1882 gegründete Metropolitan Gardens Society hatte bis 1890 etwa zweihundert kleine Gärten in den Innenstädten angelegt, die später den örtlichen Behörden übergeben wurden, so dass ihre Unterstützung für den Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal von Anfang an gesichert war.<br/><br/>Die Kyrle-Gesellschaft ist jetzt vergessen, hatte aber zu ihrer Zeit großen Einfluss auf die Stadtplanung und die Open-Space-Gesetzgebung. Die Gesellschaft war um 1875 gegründet worden, um „die Verbreitung der Schönheit“ zu fördern, Farbe und Interesse in das Leben der Menschen zu bringen, die in einer langweiligen, düsteren Umgebung leben. Helle Farbe an Wänden und Dekoration, guter Gesang, Freiräume, Natur, Literatur und Kunst. All dies fiel in den Zuständigkeitsbereich der Gesellschaft. Es gab einen dekorativen Zweig, für den William Morris Vorlesungen hielt; einen musikalischen Zweig, um Chöre und Happy Evenings für Menschen in örtlichen Schulgebäuden zu fördern; und einen Literaturzweig. Die Gesellschaft appellierte regelmäßig durch Briefe in der Times an die "reicheren Klassen" für Bücher und Zeitschriften, die an Jungen- und Mädchenclubs, Almosenhäuser und anderswo verteilt werden sollten, aber das Open Spaces Committee war das aktivste. Der Name "Kyrle" stammt von Papst Der Mann von Ross, dem Philanthropen, der seinen Geburtsort den Menschen als öffentlichen Park gab. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

I really enjoyed seei... | Mit Thanksgiving um die Ecke, hier sind einige festliche Aktenordner Spiele, die wir für die Mädchen gemacht haben. Beide Thanksgiving-Spiele konzentrieren sich auf mathematische Fähigkeiten. Und ich bin meinem Mann Ed noch einmal dankbar, dass er alle Cliparts für mich gemacht hat.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Muster machen<br/><br/>Wie der Name schon sagt, geht es in diesem Spiel darum, Muster zu erstellen. Die Kleinen lernen nur über Muster, können die Bilder einfach auf die Musterstreifen abstimmen, während andere das Muster mit den Bildkarten auf den leeren Streifen fortsetzen können.<br/><br/>Um den Dateiordner zu erstellen, möchten Sie das Raster der Bilder ausschneiden, um die Kartenstücke zu erstellen. Ich empfehle, sie zu laminieren, um ihnen zu helfen, länger zu halten. Kleben Sie dann die Musterstreifen auf den Dateiordner.<br/><br/>Ich wollte auch die leeren Musterstreifen haben, damit die Mädchen sehen konnten, wo sie das Muster fortsetzen und wie viele sie auslegen sollten. Ich befestigte sie an der Seite des Ordners mit Klebeband, so dass sie sich zusammenfalten konnten, um das Spiel zu packen und das Muster zu layouten.<br/><br/>Ich habe auch ein zusätzliches leeres hinzugefügt, damit die mädchen auch ihr eigenes muster machen können.<br/><br/>Türkei Nummer Spiel<br/><br/>In diesem Spiel fügen die Mädchen die Federn zum Truthahnkörper hinzu, während ich das Zählen und die Zahlenerkennung praktiziere. Ich habe die farblosen Federn verwendet, um als Leitfaden dafür zu dienen, wo die Federn hinzugefügt werden sollen und damit die Mädchen mit den Zahlen übereinstimmen können. Und stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie beim Verkleben des Putenkörpers nur in der Mitte kleben, damit die Flügelstücke unter den Körper gleiten können.<br/><br/>Sobald alle Federn angelegt sind, üben wir einige einfache Arithmetik, wie zum Beispiel drei Federn wegzunehmen und zu sehen, wie viele noch übrig sind, dann fügen wir zwei zurück, um zu sehen, was es ist.<br/><br/>Zusätzlich zu den schwarzen und weißen Flügeln haben wir auch einen farblosen Truthahn hinzugefügt, falls Sie die Kleinen ihr eigenes Set färben möchten. Anstelle eines Ordnerspiels können Sie dies in ein Handwerk verwandeln, die Stücke färben, sie ausschneiden und zusammenkleben.<br/><br/>Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, die Stücke zu verwenden, um eine felt board Geschichte zu machen. Wir singen manchmal eine Truthahn-Version von 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>So sieht es aus:<br/><br/>Wer bin ich?<br/><br/>Ich denke, hier soll ich etwas Witziges über mich sagen. In meinem Vorschulleben war ich Lehrerin und ich habe jetzt unsere Kinder zu Hause unterrichtet. Ich bin auch mit Ed verheiratet, der derzeit in der Luftwaffe dient und die Liebe meines Lebens ist (es wäre peinlich, wenn er es nicht wäre). Unsere Familie ist groß auf Bücher, Handwerk und Spaß zusammen. Ich dachte nur, ich würde unsere Aktivitäten in meiner eigenen kleinen Ecke des Internets teilen.<br/><br/>Zoe scheint alles zu haben - reich, gutaussehender Ehemann, einfaches New Yorker Leben - aber sie hat Fehler in ihrer Vergangenheit gemacht und diese Fehler kommen in ihrem neuen Leben wieder hoch. Ich befand mich für den größten Teil des Buches am Rand meines Sitzes und war überrascht...<br/><br/>Ich habe dieses Buch geliebt, ich liebe die Geschichte, und ich bin dankbar, dass Margot Shetterly es ans Licht gebracht hat.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkoholkonsum von Personen unter 21 Jahren wurde als ein großes Problem der öffentlichen Gesundheit identifiziert. Studien stellen fest, dass es das Risiko für Behinderungen erhöht und für das sich entwickelnde Gehirn schädlich sein kann. Minderjährige, die trinken, begehen eher Selbstmord, brechen das Gesetz oder werden Opfer von Gewalt. Alkohol ist an fast einem Drittel der Todesfälle durch Jugendverkehr beteiligt. Die jährlichen Gesamtkosten für das Trinken Minderjähriger werden auf 62 Milliarden US-Dollar geschätzt. Während die meisten Gesetze, die das Trinken von Minderjährigen verhindern sollen, auf staatlicher Ebene verabschiedet werden, gab es auf Bundesebene gesetzgeberische Aktivitäten und Interessen, um die Bemühungen der Staaten zur Eindämmung des Problems zu unterstützen. Dieser Bericht beschreibt das Ausmaß des Alkoholkonsums Minderjähriger, die jüngsten Gesetzgebungsmaßnahmen zu diesem Thema und verschiedene politische Auswirkungen. Er wird aktualisiert, sobald neue Daten verfügbar werden. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite. The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: echtes Essen<br/><br/>Letzte Woche habe ich über das Nordic Food Manifesto geschrieben, und wie Dänemark eine starke "echte" Essenskultur geschaffen hat, hauptsächlich aus einer absichtlichen Anstrengung von Claus Meyer. Es waren nicht politische Lobbyarbeit oder öffentliche Petitionen, die zu einer Ernährungsreform führten, sondern eine Graswurzelbemühung, die von Bürgern geleitet wurde, die die Macht hatten, Veränderungen tatsächlich umzusetzen und umzusetzen.<br/><br/>Ich beendete den Beitrag mit der Anspielung auf eine Frage: Warum ist es für uns so schwer, dies selbst zu tun, als Individuen? Wenn ein ganzes Land eine gemeinsame Sichtweise auf Lebensmittel umsetzen und verbreiten kann, warum können wir nicht?<br/><br/>Es gibt nichts, was uns wirklich davon abhält, Dänemarks Erfolg nachzuahmen. Das Problem ist, wir sind überschwemmt mit so vielen Nachrichten darüber, was wir essen sollten und wie wir leben sollten, es ist schwer zu wissen, wo wir anfangen sollen. Anstatt erfolgreichen Rahmenbedingungen zu folgen, die nachweislich funktionieren (wie das Nordic Food Manifesto), springen die meisten Menschen von Diät-Wahnsinn zu Diät-Wahnsinn und versuchen, den "richtigen Weg zum Essen" zu finden.<br/><br/>Aber wie war Claus Meyer erfolgreich? Was war die geheime Soße, die dem Manifest geholfen hat? Und ist es vernünftig zu denken, dass wir diese Lektionen auf unser eigenes Leben anwenden können?<br/><br/>Teilen Sie dies mit:<br/><br/>Mein Messer stürzte in das Rindfleisch mit einem hörbaren Knirschen, Pop und brutzeln.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>Ich schaute zu meiner Schwester auf, als wir beide überrascht lachten, und lächelte weiter, als ich meinen ersten Bissen zu Ende schnitt. Die einzigartige äußere Knusprigkeit des Fleisches wich einem perfekt saftigen Innenraum, was zu einem Klang führte, der dem Schneiden in eine Calzone ähnelte als ein Hackfleischpatty.<br/><br/>Wir saßen in Kopenhagens ältestem Pub, das sich eher wie ein zwangloses Bistro als eine Bar anfühlte, und ich wollte das von unserer Kellnerin / Bartender / Eigentümerin empfohlene Gericht probieren?<br/><br/>"Das Paris-Rindfleisch, es ist sehr gut", hatte sie gesagt.
