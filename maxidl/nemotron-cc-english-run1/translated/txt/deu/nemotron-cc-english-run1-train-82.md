In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR Zertifizierung Blog<br/><br/>Datum: 23.

In einfachen Worten, der Zustand ist gekennzeichnet durch: man entwickelt eine Nierenerkrankung und unterzieht sich einer Nierentransplantation und anderen Krankheiten, die mit der sauren Konzentration im Blut und Gicht verbunden sind. In der Theorie wird die Bedingung auftreten, auch wenn die genetische Veränderung von einem Elternteil vererbt wird und sporadisch auftritt, wenn es keine Familiengeschichte gibt.<br/><br/>Häufige Namen der autosomal dominanten interstitiellen Nierenerkrankung<br/><br/>Die Bedingung hat auch andere Namen, nämlich: medulläre zystische Nierenerkrankung, obwohl dieser Name nicht so oft verwendet wird, weil die meisten Menschen, die an dieser Bedingung leiden, keine medullären Zysten haben. Es wird auch als juvenile hyperurikämische Nephropathie bezeichnet. Die Krankheit betrifft tendenziell Menschen im Alter von 20 bis 50 Jahren. Der letztgenannte Zustand tritt bei kleinen Kindern auf, was bedeutet, dass beide Eltern es bekommen.<br/>Zystische Nierenerkrankung ist eine vererbte Erkrankung, bei der die Zysten in der Mitte jeder Niere allmählich ihre Fähigkeit verlieren, richtig zu funktionieren. Zysten beziehen sich auf abnormale Flüssigkeitsblasen in der Niere. Der Zustand erschreckt die Niere weiter, so dass sie nicht in der Lage ist, den Urin zu konzentrieren und als Folge zu viel Urin zu produzieren. Zu den Symptomen gehören übermäßiges Wasserlassen, Verlangen nach Salz, Schwäche, Verwirrung, Blutungen, Müdigkeit, häufiger Schluckauf, niedriger Blutdruck, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Kopfschmerzen, blasse Haut, vermindertes Gefühl in den Händen, Gewichtsverlust unter vielen anderen. Andere Komplikationen sind: Anämie, Geschwüre, Verlust der Knochendichte, Unfruchtbarkeit und andere Herzprobleme.<br/>Seine Analyse umfasst Bluttests zur Überprüfung auf Natriumspiegel und allgemeine Nierenfunktionen, Urintests zur Überprüfung der Konzentration und anderer Ungleichgewichte, Röntgenstrahlen zur Überprüfung auf die Größe der Nieren, die aufgrund erhöhter Urinkonzentrationen verändert werden können, Nierenbiopsie und genetische Tests zur Überprüfung eventueller genetischer Veränderungen, die möglicherweise rechtzeitig stattgefunden haben.<br/>Während die Krankheit keine Schnitt- und Trockenbehandlung hat, kann man sich auf die Kontrolle von Maßnahmen konzentrieren, einschließlich der Einnahme von Flüssigkeiten und Salz, um die verlorene zu ergänzen, wenn die Krankheit in die letzten Stadien fortschreitet. Andere Behandlungen umfassen die Einnahme von verschriebenen Medikamenten und Ernährungsumstellungen sowie die minimale Aufnahme von Lebensmitteln, die Phosphor und Kalium enthalten. Weitere Komplikationen können auch eine Nierentransplantation erfordern. Grundsätzlich handelt es sich nicht um eine heilbare Krankheit, sondern um eine überschaubare Krankheit, die in den frühen Stadien erkannt wird.<br/><br/>Der gemeinsame, aber unterschiedliche Faktor der autosomal dominanten interstitiellen Nierenerkrankung<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis und medulläre zystische Nierenerkrankung werden hauptsächlich zusammen gruppiert, weil sie im Wesentlichen die gleichen Merkmale haben, aber mit einem leichten Unterschied in Bezug auf Vererbungsmuster zu den ersteren, die Kinder betreffen, und die letzteren, die junge Erwachsene und ältere Altersgruppen betreffen. Ähnliche Merkmale für beide sind ADH-resistente Urinkonzentration, die zu Polyurie und Polydipsie, Anämie und Nierenerkrankungen führt.<br/>Die erste oben genannte Bedingung ist Autosomal rezessive Bilanzierung von 15% der chronischen Krankheiten und verursacht ESRD in der frühen Kindheit, während letztere ist Autosomal dominant mit ein paar sporadischen neuen Mutationen und verursacht ESRD für Menschen im Alter zwischen 30 und 50 Jahren. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Lockes Bericht über den Stand der Natur<br/><br/>Thema: PhilosophieWorte: 2539Seiten: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes und Locke gehören zu den einflussreichsten politischen Philosophen, die jemals auf Englisch geschrieben haben. Der Naturzustand, der der Organisation der komplexen Gesellschaften vorausgeht, ist die gemeinsame Prämisse, die sowohl Hobbes als auch Locke teilen, aber auf unterschiedliche Weise interpretieren. Erstere betrachten den Menschen in seinem natürlichen Zustand als ebenso gefährlich und frei, seine egoistischen Ziele uneingeschränkt durch die nicht existierenden Begriffe der Gerechtigkeit zu verfolgen, weshalb sein natürlicher Zustand auf den "Krieg eines jeden Menschen gegen jeden Menschen" hinausläuft (Hobbes76). Letztere hingegen betrachtet den Menschen in seinem ursprünglichen Zustand als ebenso wertvoll und schränkt die natürliche Freiheit durch die Idee der Gerechtigkeit ein, die es erfordert, anderen keinen Schaden zuzufügen, was es erlaubt, den Zustand der Natur als "gegenseitige Hilfe und Erhaltung" und nicht als Krieg zu definieren (Locke 15). Der Hauptunterschied zwischen den Berichten der beiden Philosophen über den natürlichen Zustand besteht darin, dass Locke ethische Überlegungen anwendet, während Hobbes dies nicht tut, und es führt Hobbes schließlich dazu, sich einen Staat vorzustellen, der unbegrenzte Macht über Menschen ausübt, während Locke die Regierung durch die moralischen Prinzipien begrenzt, die er für ein Naturgesetz hält.<br/><br/>Hobbes stützt seine Annahmen über den Zustand der Natur auf die Tatsache, dass alle Menschen in ihren körperlichen und geistigen Fähigkeiten ungefähr gleich sind. Er gibt zu, dass einige Individuen größere körperliche Stärke oder überlegenen Intellekt zeigen können, besteht aber darauf, dass "wenn alles zusammengerechnet wird, der Unterschied zwischen Mensch und Mensch nicht so beträchtlich ist" (Hobbes 74). Da Menschen in ihren Fähigkeiten ungefähr gleich sind, haben sie auch ähnliche Hoffnungen, ihre Ziele zu erreichen und ihre Bedürfnisse zu befriedigen (Hobbes 75). Als logisches Ergebnis dieser Gleichheit, wenn die Menschen anfangen, um knappe Ressourcen zu konkurrieren, kann sich niemand in seinem Besitz völlig sicher fühlen. Selbst wenn es einem mächtigen, listigen und fähigen Menschen gelingt, „die Menschen aller Menschen, die er kann“, zu unterwerfen, garantiert er dennoch nicht die ultimative Sicherheit (Hobbes 75). Da kein Mensch eine solche Überlegenheit über die anderen erlangen kann, die ihn oder sie völlig immun gegen seine Stärke des Intellekts macht, kann sich kein Mensch völlig sicher fühlen, wenn er von seinen oder ihren Gleichen umgeben ist. Hobbes 'Gleichheit im natürlichen Zustand ist die Gleichheit der Angst, wo sich alle Menschen als gefährliche Konkurrenten betrachten.<br/><br/>Genau wie Hobbes hält Locke alle Menschen für grundsätzlich gleich, weist dem Begriff aber eine ganz andere Bedeutung zu: Aus seiner Sicht geht es nicht um die Gleichheit der Fähigkeiten, sondern um die Gleichheit des Wertes. Er meint, dass die Menschen "promiscuously geboren, um alle die gleichen Vorteile der Natur" logischerweise genießen die perfekte Gleichheit unter ihnen, da es keinen Grund gibt, jemand von Natur aus wertvoller (Locke 8) zu betrachten. Die einzige mögliche Grundlage, um einige Menschen als den anderen überlegen zu bezeichnen, wäre, wenn Gott "durch eine offenkundige Erklärung seines Willens einen über den anderen stellt" (Locke 8). Da eine solche göttliche Sanktion der Überlegenheit fehlt, kommt Locke zu dem Schluss, dass die natürliche Gleichheit aller Vertreter der Menschheit nicht in Frage gestellt werden darf. Hobbes nähert sich der Gleichheit pragmatisch und betont, dass Menschen in ihrem natürlichen Zustand gleichermaßen gefährlich sind, aber Locke verwendet einen ethischen Ansatz und betont, dass Menschen in Gottes Augen gleichermaßen wertvoll sind. Diese Meinungsverschiedenheit ist nur der erste Unterschied zwischen den beiden Autoren, der auf der Tatsache beruht, dass Locke Gott als Prämisse in seine politische Philosophie einbezieht, während Hobbes dies nicht tut.<br/><br/>Ein weiteres charakteristisches Merkmal von Hobbes' Darstellung des natürlichen Zustands ist seine Interpretation der Freiheit. Laut Hobbes bedeutet der Zustand der Natur unbegrenzte Freiheit, alles zu tun, was für das Fortbestehen notwendig ist. Der Philosoph definiert Freiheit als "die Abwesenheit von äußeren Hindernissen", wenn man seine Fähigkeiten benutzt, um seine Ziele zu erreichen (Hobbes 79). Die Freiheit Hobbes’ bedeutet daher die ungehinderte Gelegenheit, alles zu tun, was nach eigenem Ermessen am besten geeignet wäre, Leben und Besitz zu erhalten (Hobbes 79). Die einzige Einschränkung der Freiheit ist, dass eine Person nichts tun kann, was der Erhaltung ihres Lebens oder der Zerstörung "der Mittel zur Erhaltung derselben" widerspricht (Hobbes 79). Abgesehen davon gibt es keine Grenzen, und jeder hat "ein Recht auf alles, sogar auf den Körper des anderen", wenn das sein Überleben fördert (Hobbes 80). So ist die natürliche Freiheit, wie Hobbes sie sieht, die Abwesenheit von äußerlich erzwungenen Hindernissen, wenn man sein Recht auf alles verfolgt, um sein Fortbestehen zu erhalten und zu sichern.<br/><br/>Locke hält auch die Idee der natürlichen Freiheit aufrecht, nähert sich ihr aber nicht überraschend auf eine Weise, die sich erheblich von der von Hobbes unterscheidet. Sobald er anfängt, über Freiheit im Naturzustand zu diskutieren, stellt er sofort fest, dass ein Zustand der Freiheit nicht "einen Zustand der Lizenz" gleichsetzt (Locke 9). Der Philosoph identifiziert zwei spezifische Einschränkungen der menschlichen Freiheit im Naturzustand. Die erste ist identisch mit der von Hobbes eingeführten: Wie frei und unabhängig eine Person auch sein mag, sie "hat dennoch nicht die Freiheit, sich selbst zu zerstören" (Locke 9). Laut Locke hat jeder Mensch eine natürliche Verpflichtung, "einen anderen in seinem Leben, seiner Gesundheit, Freiheit oder seinem Besitz nicht zu schädigen" (9). Genau wie bei seiner Interpretation der Gleichheit gründet der Autor diese Behauptung auf ethischen und religiösen Gründen: Die Menschen sollten sich gegenseitig die Existenz bewahren, da sie alle Schöpfungen desselben "allmächtigen und unendlich weisen Schöpfers" sind (Locke 9). So schränkt Locke die Freiheit im natürlichen Zustand viel strenger ein als Hobbes, indem er die Verpflichtung einführt, sich selbst und den anderen nicht zu schaden.<br/><br/>Die Unterschiede zwischen den beiden Autoren manifestieren sich auch in ihren Berichten über Gerechtigkeit im natürlichen Zustand der Menschheit. Was Hobbes betrifft, ist die Abgrenzung gerechter und ungerechter Praktiken nur Sache des Gesetzes. Es gibt keine Rechtsprechung im Naturzustand, und das einzige Gesetz, das den Menschen in seinem ursprünglichen Zustand regiert, ist ein Naturgesetz, das ihn nur verpflichtet, persönliche Sicherheit zu suchen. Infolgedessen kann nichts im ursprünglichen Zustand der Menschheit ungerecht sein: "Worte von richtiger und falscher Gerechtigkeit und Ungerechtigkeit" haben keinen Platz und keinen Sinn in Abwesenheit des streng durchgesetzten Gesetzes (Hobbes 78). Solange die Menschen ihre nahezu unbegrenzte Freiheit nutzen, um rücksichtslos um Ressourcen zu konkurrieren, auf die sie gleichermaßen Anspruch haben, haben sie keine Kriterien, um zwischen gerechten und ungerechten Handlungen zu unterscheiden. Daher widersetzt sich der Hobbessche Naturzustand selbst der Idee der Gerechtigkeit, da der Autor sie als bloße Funktion des formalisierten und etablierten Gesetzes interpretiert.<br/><br/>Locke weist der Justiz eine andere Bedeutung zu und betrachtet sie nicht so sehr in gesetzgeberischer als in ethischer Hinsicht. In diesem Papier wurde bereits erwähnt, dass Locke im Gegensatz zu Hobbes ethische Vorstellungen anwendet und seine politische Philosophie im Allgemeinen eher auf moralische als auf rein praktische Vermutungen stützt. Lockes Naturgesetz verpflichtet im Gegensatz zu Hobbes die Menschen, sich umeinander zu kümmern, anstatt jeden einfach für sich selbst zu sorgen. Infolgedessen gibt es in seinem Naturzustand einen Platz für Gerechtigkeit und Ungerechtigkeit. Der Autor weist selbst auf diese Tatsache hin, wenn er feststellt, dass niemand einen anderen seines Lebens der Mittel berauben sollte, es zu bewahren, "es sei denn, einem Täter gerecht zu werden" (Locke 9). Diese Aussage zeigt mit größter Klarheit, dass es nach Locke Gerechtigkeit im Zustand der Natur gibt, und darüber hinaus müssen die Menschen sie aktiv bewahren. Das Kriterium der Gerechtigkeit, die Hobbes 'natürlichen Zustand fehlt, ist die zweite Einschränkung der natürlichen Freiheit von Locke auferlegt: eine Aktion ist ungerecht, wenn sie eine ungerechtfertigte Bedrohung für das Leben und den Besitz einer anderen Person darstellt.<br/><br/>Diese Unterschiede in der Behandlung der beiden Autoren von Gleichheit, Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit oder Ungerechtigkeit gipfeln in ihrer Interpretation der Beziehung zwischen dem Naturzustand und dem Kriegszustand. Aus Hobbes Sicht sind die beiden gleichbedeutend, weil der rücksichtslose Wettbewerb das einzige logische Ergebnis ist, wenn Menschen mit gleichwertigen Fähigkeiten und ähnlichen Bedürfnissen in ein Umfeld mit begrenzten Ressourcen gebracht werden. Er stellt diese Verbindung direkt fest: "Wenn irgendwelche zwei Männer dasselbe wünschen, das sie dennoch nicht beide genießen können, werden sie Feinde" und sind deshalb im Zustand des Krieges mit einander (Hobbes 75). Doch da die Menschen zahlreich sind und alle ähnliche Fähigkeiten und Bedürfnisse besitzen, manifestiert sich dieser Wettbewerb nicht nur in den individuellen Interaktionen, sondern auch auf der Ebene der Menschheit als Ganzes. Solange alle Menschen gleiche und unbegrenzte Rechte auf alle Ressourcen und sogar auf den Körper und das Leben des anderen haben, ist der Naturzustand ein Krieg "jeder Mensch gegen jeden Menschen" (Hobbes 76). Diese grimmige Interpretation ergibt sich direkt aus Hobbes 'Darstellung des Zustands der Natur, wie sie ausschließlich von den egoistischen Trieben der Individuen regiert wird.<br/><br/>Locke hingegen unterscheidet zwischen dem Naturzustand und dem Kriegszustand und weist darauf hin, dass sie zwar gleichzeitig auftreten können, aber kein Grund ist, sich miteinander zu identifizieren. Lockes Definition des Kriegszustandes ist praktisch identisch mit der von Hobbes: "Wer versucht, einen anderen Mann in seine absolute Macht zu bringen, versetzt sich damit in einen Kriegszustand mit ihm" (14). Diese Erklärung stimmt perfekt mit der Hobbesschen Vorstellung überein, dass das universelle Recht eines jeden auf alles, einschließlich der Körper und Leben der anderen Menschen, zum Kriegszustand führt. Doch Locke weigert sich, den Kriegszustand und den Naturzustand gleichzusetzen, gerade weil er Hobbes’ Interpretation der natürlichen Freiheit leugnet. Da Lockes natürlicher Zustand die Menschen davon abhält, sich gegenseitig durch die zweite Einschränkung der Freiheit zu schaden, ist ein Versuch auf die Freiheit einer anderen Person eine Übertretung gegen das Naturgesetz. Während für Hobbes der Krieg standardmäßig der Zustand der Menschheit ist, stellt Locke ihn eher als eine Perversion des Naturzustands als als dessen Herrschaft dar.<br/><br/>Diese Unterschiede bei der Abgrenzung des Staates zur Natur und ihren Bestandteilen wie Freiheit, Gleichheit, Gerechtigkeit und Krieg ebnen den Weg für die Autoren, die gegensätzliche Darstellungen der Regierung darstellen. Aufgrund seiner pessimistischen Einschätzung des Naturzustandes kommt der Autor von Leviathan zu dem Schluss, dass es unter den Bedingungen des Krieges keine definitive Hoffnung geben kann, "die Zeit zu leben, die die Natur den Menschen normalerweise zu leben erlaubt" (Hobbes 80). Die Lösung besteht darin, das universelle Recht auf alles festzulegen und jedem „so viel Freiheit gegen andere Menschen zu lassen, wie er es anderen Menschen gegen sich selbst erlauben würde“ (Hobbes 80). Die Teilnehmer des sich daraus ergebenden Gesellschaftsvertrags investieren die unbegrenzten Freiheiten, die sie sich ergeben haben, in einen Souverän – den Träger der höchsten Macht, deren Ziel es ist, den erreichten Status quo zu bewahren, indem er alle Übertretungen gegen ihn bestraft. Die Macht des Souveräns ist absolut: Der Herrscher hat die Autorität, "alles zu tun, was er für notwendig hält", um den Frieden zwischen seinen Untertanen zu fördern, so dass niemand das Leben oder Eigentum eines anderen angreifen würde (113). Hobbes kommt zu dem Schluss, dass es ohne eine so unangreifbare Person, die berechtigt ist, irgendetwas mit den Untertanen zu tun, keinen Frieden und keine Garantie für Sicherheit geben kann.<br/><br/>Während Locke mit der Notwendigkeit einverstanden ist, politisch organisierte Gesellschaften zu schaffen, stellt er dennoch die Idee von Hobbes der souveränen Macht als unbegrenzt und unangreifbar entgegen. Wie oben erwähnt, ist Lockes Naturzustand nicht annähernd so schrecklich wie der, den Hobbes wegen der Verpflichtung des Volkes gemalt hat, nicht nur sich selbst, sondern auch einander zu bewahren. Daher ergibt sich das Bedürfnis nach sozialem Vertrag nicht aus der Angst vor den anderen, sondern aus der bloßen Bequemlichkeit. Kleine Gemeinschaften benötigen möglicherweise nicht viele Gesetze, um Konflikte zu lösen, und "Offiziere, um den Prozess zu überwachen", aber größere Verbände finden es ratsam, Regierungen zu diesem Zweck einzurichten (Locke 57). Doch die Macht der Regierung kann nicht unbegrenzt sein, weil sie die Untertanen einem "unbeständigen, unsicheren, unbekannten, willkürlichen Willen eines anderen Mannes" unterwerfen würde (Locke 17). Eine solche Regierung würde eine doppelte Verletzung des Naturgesetzes darstellen. Indem er der absoluten Macht eines anderen Menschen über sein Leben zustimmt, würde ein Subjekt seine erste Beschränkung verletzen, die es verbietet, sich selbst zu schaden. Was den Herrscher betrifft, so würde die Zerstörung der Freiheit einer anderen Person einen direkten Schaden darstellen und als solcher der zweiten Einschränkung widersprechen.<br/><br/>Als direkte Fortsetzung seines Falles für eine unbegrenzte Regierungsbehörde bestreitet Hobbes die Gewaltenteilung als Prinzip. Aus seiner Sicht besitzt der Souverän, sobald er eingesetzt ist, "die ganze Macht, die Regeln vorzuschreiben", die das Leben der Untertanen oder, in kürzeren Begriffen, die gesetzgebende Gewalt regeln (Hobbes 114). Der Souverän behält sich auch das Recht vor, "alle Kontroversen zu hören und zu entscheiden" - das heißt, die Justizgewalt (Hobbes 114). Schließlich, da der ganze Zweck des Souveräns darin besteht, die Untertanen zu zwingen, sich gegenseitig nicht zu schaden, kann es keinen Zweifel daran geben, dass die Exekutivgewalt auch sein ausschließliches Vorrecht ist. Die Gewaltenteilung als Konzept ist Hobbes aufgrund seiner Ansichten über den Zustand der Natur fremd. Die Schaffung einer politischen Einheit, in der sich die Exekutive, Legislative und Judikative gegenseitig überprüfen würden - das heißt, konkurrieren - würde bedeuten, den Hobbesschen Zustand der Natur als Krieg auf einer höheren Ebene wiederherzustellen. Da die Menschen einen Gesellschaftsvertrag eingehen und eine Regierung einsetzen, um den Zustand der Natur hinter sich zu lassen, nicht in einer anderen Form wieder einzusetzen, widerspricht die Gewaltenteilung Hobbes' Ansichten direkt.<br/><br/>Locke hingegen nimmt die Gewaltenteilung als ein grundlegendes Prinzip seiner politischen Theorie an, was sich in der Diskussion über die Grenzen der gesetzgebenden Gewalt zeigt. Wie Locke es ausdrückt, wäre es kaum ratsam, "für die gleichen Personen, die die Macht haben, Gesetze zu machen, auch die Macht in ihren Händen zu haben, sie auszuführen" (76). Der Philosoph weist auf die Unvollkommenheiten der menschlichen Natur und den inhärenten Wunsch hin, als Begründung für diese Vorsichtsmaßnahme "an der Macht zu greifen" (Locke 76). Genau wie in Hobbes Fall stammt Lockes Bericht über die Gewaltenteilung direkt aus seiner Interpretation des Naturzustandes. Wenn es bereits Gerechtigkeit im Naturzustand gibt und die Menschen sie verstehen können, unterliegt jede Regierung unweigerlich demselben Naturgesetz. Da die absolute Macht über die Menschen beide Beschränkungen dieses Gesetzes verletzt, ist es ratsam, es zu trennen und zu verteilen, damit die Regierung angemessen funktioniert.<br/><br/>Dieses Papier hat gezeigt, dass, während die Unterschiede zwischen Hobbes' und Locke's Berichte über den natürlichen Zustand der Menschheit zahlreich sind, sie letztlich auf das Vorhandensein von moralischen Prämissen hinauslaufen. Hobbes betrachtet den natürlichen Zustand als den der unbegrenzten Freiheit, in der Menschen, die mit gleichen Fähigkeiten ausgestattet und nicht an moralische Vorstellungen wie Gerechtigkeit gebunden sind, unaufhörlich um die Ressourcen konkurrieren. Locke interpretiert jedoch Gleichheit und Freiheit eher ethisch als praktisch und meint, dass Krieg eine Perversion des natürlichen Zustands ist, da das Naturgesetz den Menschen verpflichtet, sich gegenseitig nicht zu schaden. Hobbes beharrt auf einem allmächtigen Herrscher, denn ohne ethische Einschränkungen könnte keine andere Autorität die Menschen zwingen, sich gegenseitig nicht zu schaden. Lockes Ansicht nach würde die Gewährung unbegrenzter Befugnisse der Regierung jedoch im Widerspruch zu den ethischen Beschränkungen stehen, die im Naturgesetz verankert sind, weshalb er im Gegensatz zu Hobbes die Gewaltenteilung befürwortet. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Fashion Police: Was Game of Thrones aufgab<br/><br/>Der kanadisch-französische Sänger Abbas Hasan hat sich bei der Fashion Parade 2014 blendend bemüht, die gesamte Menschheit zu überstrahlen. Daran ist nichts falsch, außer Sicherheit hat Priorität und der Musiker ist hier ein Gesundheitsrisiko.<br/><br/>Wir bekommen, dass er ein Star sein will. Leider hat er das Memo nicht bekommen, in dem sie den Verzweifelten und den berüchtigten erzählen, dass Ruhm eine Metapher ist. Sie müssen nicht wie einer aussehen und buchstäblich unseren Anblick in Brand setzen. Auch die All Pakistan Aunty Association hat offiziell eine Beschwerde gegen ihn eingereicht. Der lokale Markt ist von gefälschten Kristallen und Pailletten-Monstrositäten ausgetrocknet. Sie haben nichts zu ihren zweiwöchentlich hohen Tees zu tragen und sie behaupten, er sei schuld. Anscheinend ist das Outfit von Game of Thrones inspiriert. Kann er bitte traurige Lieder über den toten Hund seines Nachbarn komponieren, anstatt Outfits zu entwerfen? Oder vielleicht ist es das Trauma, den Hund zu verlieren, dessen Tod er eindeutig nicht vorbei ist, da er immer noch seinen Kadaver trägt.<br/><br/>Das Charge Sheet Outfit<br/><br/>Niemand kann entscheiden, wo das Outfit beginnt und wo Abbas endet. Sie starren fasziniert in einen tiefen Abgrund und fragen sich, warum er Lederhosen trägt. Wessen Pferd hat er getötet, um den Sattel zu stehlen, der über seine Schultern drapiert ist? War er kurz vor seinem Erscheinen im Gefängnis und vergaß, die Ketten abzunehmen? Wie wird er den synthetischen Leder- und Post-Sequin-Ausschlag überleben, der in so hoher Dosierung tödlich sein muss? Warum lebe ich noch?<br/><br/>Idee<br/><br/>Seine Inspiration war anscheinend Game of Thrones, aber am Ende sah er aus, als würde er aus einem Viking-Restaurant geworfen. Wäre er auf einen der Charaktere aus der Show gestoßen, wäre er in den ersten fünf Sekunden der ersten Episode getötet worden.<br/><br/>Die psychische Gesundheit oder der Mangel daran: Jemand bringt ihn so schnell wie möglich zu einem Berater! Er scheint davon auszugehen, dass das Tragen eines toten Hundes bedeutet, dass der einzige Freund, den er in seinem Leben hatte, noch am Leben ist. Lieber Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Leugnung ist kein Fluss in Ägypten<br/><br/>2. Deine gequälte Psyche hilft deiner Musik nicht, also hol dir Hilfe<br/><br/>3. Versuchen Sie imaginäre Freunde<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>Wir alle im Hauptquartier der Modepolizei sind schwer traumatisiert. Abbas ist jemand, den wir nicht gerne verhaftet haben. Er ist derzeit in Haft und versucht sich zu rächen, indem er Kleidung aus anderen Fantasy-Shows anzieht. Er glitterte nur, um wie Edward Cullen aus Twilight auszusehen. Als öffentliche Botschaft und um weitere Nervenzusammenbrüche zu verhindern, gaben wir ihm die folgenden Beispiele von Männern vom roten Teppich des gleichen Ereignisses.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Wenn Sie Zweifel haben, spielen Sie auf Nummer sicher. Der Sänger sieht aus wie Ihr durchschnittlicher Onkel bei einem Shaadi. Ein schlichter schwarzer Anzug ohne Zubehör, auch wenn er etwas unverhältnismäßig ist, ist praktikabel. Zohaibs Look fügt sich in alles und nichts ein, und wenn Sie keinen Sinn für Mode oder das Geld haben, einen Stylisten einzustellen, ist das in Ordnung. Es birgt nicht das Risiko eines Herzstillstands für andere Teilnehmer einer Veranstaltung. Angesichts Abbas' heikler mentaler Verfassung ist dieser Blick das, was er anstreben sollte. Immer und für immer.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Eines Tages, nach Jahrzehnten der Therapie, könnte Abbas danach streben, Kleidung wie Ali Zafars zu tragen. Der elegante Sommerlook ist nahezu perfekt. Ali sah fast aus wie ein Maître d in einem französischen Restaurant mit seiner weißen Sommerjacke mit schwarzem Revers, aber das Hemd rettet es, ganz zu schweigen vom Satin. Seine Hose wäre lächerlich gewesen, wenn sie nicht an den Knöcheln gefaltet worden wäre. Die Schuhe sind das, woraus Hipster Chic Happy End besteht. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Bestimmung der bodenhydraulischen Eigenschaften mit verschiedenen Benetzungsflüssigkeiten: Eine Dissertation, die in teilweiser Erfüllung der Anforderungen für den Master of Science an der Lincoln University eingereicht wurde<br/><br/>Abstrakt<br/><br/>Bodenhydraulische Eigenschaften wie hydraulische Leitfähigkeit, Wasserretention und Pflanzenwasserverhältnisse dominieren die Wasserbewegungsprozesse, zum Beispiel die Infiltration, Verdunstung und der Wasserfluss im Boden. Als ein weit verbreitetes Phänomen im Boden verändert die Bodenwasserabweisung die hydraulischen Funktionen des Bodens, indem sie dem Wasserfluss in den Boden widersteht. Darüber hinaus hängen die hydraulischen Eigenschaften nicht nur vom Porensystem des Bodens ab, sondern werden auch von den physikalisch-chemischen Eigenschaften der Porenoberflächen beeinflusst. Im Vergleich zu Wasser wird Ethanol aufgrund seiner geringeren Oberflächenspannung nicht durch die Wasserabweisung beeinflusst. Der Zweck der Verwendung von Ethanol besteht darin, die Wirkung der Bodenwasserabweisung auf die Messung der hydraulischen Eigenschaften zu eliminieren. Die Anwendung von reinem Ethanol in natürlichen Boden kann jedoch die organischen Materialien des Bodens abbauen und zu Veränderungen der physikalischen Eigenschaften führen. Daher können die wässrigen Ethanollösungen eine Alternative sein. Dennoch bleibt die Möglichkeit, wässriges Ethanol zur Bestimmung der Bodenflüssigkeitsrückhaltekurve zu verwenden, unbekannt. Ziel dieser Studie ist es, die Durchführbarkeit der wässrigen Ethanollösungen (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % und 100 % v/v) für die Bestimmung der Flüssigkeitsrückhaltekurve unter einem kleinen Bereich des angewandten Drucks in groben Sandproben mit unterschiedlicher Benetzbarkeit und organisch modifiziertem Naturboden (Templeton Silt Loam (TSL) mit Pilzkompost, Biokohle, Milchabwässern und kommunalem Kompost, die Einsatzrate betrug 15 Gew.) zu testen. Das Ergebnis zeigte, dass die Desorption von wässrigen Ethanollösungen im Vergleich zu Wasser um etwa das 1- bis 3-fache schneller war, basierend auf dem Flüssigkeitsgehalt bei dem gleichen angewandten Druck und der Zeit für das Erreichen jedes Gleichgewichts. Die Ergebnisse des Sandversuchs legten nahe, dass, wenn die Konzentration der wässrigen Ethanollösung unter 50 % lag, die Verdampfungsverluste weniger als 1 % und die relativen Unterschiede zwischen Prüfflüssigkeit und Wasser weniger als 10 % betrugen. Die Verdampfungsverluste betrugen jedoch 11,06 % bzw. 24,6 %, und die relativen Unterschiede lagen in 50 % bzw. 100 % Ethanollösung bei rund 15 % bzw. 30 %. Im Gegensatz dazu erhöhten die organischen Änderungen in Templeton-Schlamm nicht nur die Wasserrückhaltefähigkeit, sondern reduzierten auch die Verdunstungsverluste. Die Verdunstungsverluste im TSL-Boden und im TSL-Boden mit organischen Veränderungen betrugen 1 % in Lösungen mit weniger als 50 % Ethanolgehalt, die Verdunstungsverluste von 50 % bzw. 100 % Ethanol betrugen 2,8 % bzw. 2,9 %. Die relativen Unterschiede zwischen Wasser und Prüfflüssigkeit waren ähnlich wie beim Sandversuch, als die Prüfflüssigkeitskonzentrationen unter 50 % lagen. Die relativen Unterschiede bei 50 % und 100 % Ethanollösung waren jedoch geringer als bei der Sandprobe mit etwa 10 % bzw. 15 %. Darüber hinaus deutete die Analyse der relativen Differenz darauf hin, dass fast alle wässrigen Ethanollösungen einen geringeren volumetrischen Flüssigkeitsgehalt bei demselben zugeführten Druck hatten als Wasser, was eine Reflexion der wässrigen Ethanollösungen war, die unter äquivalentem Druck schneller desorbiert wurden als Wasser. Daher könnten 10 % bis 40 % der Ethanollösungen als Alternative zur Bestimmung der hydraulischen Eigenschaften des Bodens angesehen werden, da sie eine schnellere Desorptionsrate aufweisen und nicht durch die Bodenwasserabweisung beeinträchtigt werden. Aufgrund der Verdampfung und Auflösung von organischem Material waren wässrige Ethanollösungen über 50% Konzentration nicht für groben Sand oder mittelstrukturierten Boden geeignet....
