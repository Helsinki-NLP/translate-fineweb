Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigation posten<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" gewinnt Best Writing Award<br/><br/>Das von Len Grant ins Leben gerufene Blog-Projekt "Life Without Papers" zeigt Geschichten von Migrantenfamilien und jungen Menschen ohne Papiere. Migranten ohne Papiere haben nichts. Sie dürfen nicht arbeiten. Sie haben weder Anspruch auf staatliche Leistungen noch auf einen Platz zum Leben. Sie sind unsichtbar und möglicherweise die verletzlichste Gruppe in Großbritannien heute.<br/><br/>Zu den undokumentierten (oder irregulären) migranten gehören diejenigen, die in den sexhandel oder zur häuslichen knechtschaft verschleppt werden; dazu gehören visumübertreter; diejenigen, deren asylanträge abgelehnt wurden und andere, die im einwanderungssystem versagt haben. All dies könnte ursprünglich legal nach Großbritannien gekommen sein.<br/><br/>"Illegale Einwanderer" - diejenigen, von denen man annimmt, dass sie auf dem Rücken von Lastwagen ins Land gekommen sind - machen einen kleinen Teil der Undokumentierten aus.<br/><br/>Tatsächlich deuten einige Quellen darauf hin, dass die Hälfte der geschätzten 120.000 undokumentierten Kinder in Großbritannien tatsächlich hier von undokumentierten Eltern geboren wurden. Diese Kinder sind von Geburt an benachteiligt, allein durch ihren Einwanderungsstatus.<br/><br/>Der Blog erzählt die Geschichten der Undokumentierten. Er zeigt ihre täglichen Kämpfe und Verwundbarkeiten, aber auch ihre Stärke und Widerstandsfähigkeit.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbatschulunterricht<br/><br/>In Galater befasst sich Paulus mit Fragen wie Freiheit, der Rolle des Gesetzes bei der Erlösung, unserem Zustand in Christus und der Natur des vom Geist geführten Lebens sowie der uralten Frage: Wie können sündige Menschen vor einem heiligen und gerechten Gott gerecht gemacht werden?<br/><br/>Viele Gelehrte glauben, dass Galater der früheste Brief des Paulus sein könnten. Es wurde im Jahre 49 n. Chr. geschrieben, kurz nach dem berühmten Jerusalemer Konzil (Apg 15). Daher könnte das Buch das älteste bekannte christliche Dokument sein. Wie Apostelgeschichte und Galater deutlich machen, befand sich die frühe Kirche in einem erbitterten Kampf um die Natur des Heils, besonders im Falle der Heiden. Nach einer Gruppe von jüdischen Gläubigen, die als Judenmacher bekannt sind, war der Glaube an Jesus allein nicht gut genug für die Heiden, auch die Heiden müssen beschnitten werden und den Gesetzen Moses folgen (Apg 15,1).<br/><br/>Der Bibelstudienführer dieses Viertels lädt uns ein, mit dem Apostel Paulus zu reisen, während er die Galater bittet, Jesus treu zu bleiben. Es gibt uns auch die Möglichkeit, über unser eigenes Verständnis der Wahrheiten nachzudenken, die den Weg für Martin Luthers endgültigen Bruch mit Rom und die Wiederherstellung des biblischen Evangeliums ebneten. |

Sie hatten auch Probleme, Sachsen-Hildburghausen war durch die katastrophale Politik von Fredericks Vorgängern finanziell ruiniert worden. Die Empfänger erlaubten dem Herzog und der Herzogin nur eine reduzierte Bürgerliste, Charlottes Vater und zwei Brüder blieben oft bei Charlotte in Hildburghausen. 1787 zog sie dauerhaft nach Hildburghausen und wurde Präsidentin des Kreditausschusses. 1792 flohen Charlottes Großmutter und ihre Schwestern vor dem vorrückenden französischen Heer von Darmstadt nach Hildburghausen. Ihre Großmutter bemerkte Charlottes Ehemann. Von all seinen Pflichten erfüllt er seine ehelichen Pflichten mit Eifer. Charlotte, die diesen Mann nie geliebt hat, ist immer schwanger, die Familie verbrachte mehrere unbeschwerte Wochen in Hildburghausen. 1793 kehrte Charlottes Großmutter aus dem Exil zurück und reiste mit Charlottes Schwestern nach Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte hatte eine sehr intime und liebevolle Beziehung zu ihrer Schwester Friederike und Verwandten in Strelitz. In den Jahren 1803 und 1805 besuchte das preußische Königspaar Hildburghausen, zu diesem Anlass erlaubten die Empfänger dem herzoglichen Paar, einige ihrer Möbel zu erneuern. Louise hatte bei der Ausarbeitung der Kriegserklärung mitgeholfen, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg war ein Freund des herzoglichen Paares und Pate von Charlottes Sohn Edward. Viele Zuschauer waren gekommen, um die bayerische Kronprinzessin zu sehen, als Truchseß seine Gäste empfing und versuchte, die untere Charlotte zuerst in sein Schloss zu führen, aber sie lehnte es ab, sich auf ihre Tochter beziehend. Truchseß entgegnete: Eure Hoheit wird mir verzeihen, aber solange dieses Schloss hier gestanden hat, griff Therese die Barone an den anderen Arm, und die drei gingen zusammen durch das Tor. Die Herzogin gab etwa die Hälfte ihres Einkommens den Armen, Rentnern<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Prinz Charles von Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Prinz Karl von Hessen-Kassel war ein Kadettenmitglied des Hauses Hessen-Kassel und ein dänischer Generalfeldmarschall. Aufgewachsen mit Verwandten am dänischen Hof, verbrachte er den größten Teil seines Lebens in Dänemark und seine Mutter war eine Tochter von König Georg II. von Großbritannien und Caroline von Ansbach und eine Schwester von Königin Louise von Dänemark. Sein Vater, der zukünftige Landgraf, verließ die Familie 1747, 1755 beendete er offiziell die Ehe mit Maria. Der Großvater, Wilhelm VIII., Landgraf von Hessen, gewährte die Grafschaft Hanau und ihre Einnahmen an Maria, den jungen Prinzen Karl und seine beiden Brüder, Wilhelm und Friedrich, wurden von ihrer Mutter aufgezogen und seit 1747 von protestantischen Verwandten gepflegt. 1756 zog Maria nach Dänemark, um sich um die minderjährigen Kinder ihrer Schwester, Königin Louise von Dänemark, zu kümmern. Mit ihr nahm sie ihre Söhne, die am Hof des Schlosses Christiansborg in Kopenhagen aufwuchsen. Die hessischen Fürsten blieben später in Dänemark und wurden zu ihren wichtigen Herren. Nur der älteste Bruder Wilhelm kehrte 1785 nach Hessen zurück, als er die Landgrafschaft bestieg. Charles begann eine Karriere in Dänemark. Im Jahre 1758 wurde er Oberst, im Alter von 20 Generalmajor, auch im Jahre 1766 wurde er zum Generalgouverneur von Norwegen ernannt, eine Position, die er bis 1768 hielt, aber die meist Titel blieb, da er nie nach Norwegen während dieser Zeit ging. Im Jahr 1763 heiratete sein älterer Bruder William ihren ersten Cousin, Charles folgte am 30. August 1766 im Christiansborg Palace - seine Frau war Louise von Dänemark, und Charles wurde damit Schwager seines Cousins, König Christian VII. Die Ehe fand trotz Ratschlägen statt, die gegen sie gegeben wurden, aufgrund von Vorwürfen der Ausschweifung durch Prinz Charles. Kurz darauf geriet Charles am Hof in Ungnade, und Anfang 1767 bekamen er und sie dort ihr erstes Kind, Marie Sophie, 1767 und dann ihr zweites Kind, William, 1769. 1768 kaufte Karl das Gut und Dorf Offenbach-Rumpenheim von der Familie Edelsheim, 1771 ließ er das Gut zu einem Schloss und Fürstensitz ausbauen und seine Mutter Maria lebte bis zu ihrem Tod 1772 im Schloss. 1781 verkaufte Karl das Schloss Rumpenheim an seinen jüngeren Bruder, Karl ließ sich mit seiner Familie auf Schloss Gottorp in Schleswig nieder. 1771 bekamen sie dort ihr drittes Kind Friedrich, 1770 schenkte König Christian VII. seiner Schwester das Gut Tegelhof in Güby zwischen der Stadt Schleswig und Eckernförde. Von 1772 bis 1776 ließ Charles eine Sommerresidenz auf dem Gelände bauen, die er Louisenlund zu Ehren seiner Frau nannte, im September 1772 wurde Charles zum Oberbefehlshaber der norwegischen Armee ernannt und er und Louise zogen nach Christiana. Die Zuweisung war eine Folge des Staatsstreichs von König Gustav III. von Schweden am 19. August 1772, während in Norwegen Prinzessin Louise 1773 ihr viertes Kind Juliane zur Welt brachte.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Louise Caroline von Hessen-Kassel<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline wurde in Gottorp im Herzogtum Schleswig als Tochter des Landgrafen Karl von Hessen-Kassel und dessen Frau Prinzessin Louise von Dänemark geboren.<br/>–<br/>Prinzessin Louise Caroline<br/><br/>19.<br/>Prinz Friedrich von Hessen<br/>–<br/>Landgraf Friedrich<br/><br/>20.<br/>Prinz Wilhelm von HessenPrinz Wilhelm von Hessen<br/>–<br/>Wilhelm von Hessen-Kassel<br/><br/>212223.<br/>Prinzessin Louise24.<br/>Sophia Frederica von Mecklenburg-Schwerin<br/>–<br/>Sophia Frederica von Me252627 maternal28.<br/>Albert Azzo II., Markgraf von Mailand<br/>–<br/>Alberto Azzo II., Markgraf von Mailand und Ligurien, Graf von Gavello und Padua, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice und Montagnana, alias Albertezzo II., war ein mächtiger Adliger im Heiligen Römischen Reich. Er gilt als der Gründer der Casa dEste, nachdem er das Oberhaupt der ersten Familie war, die Este beherrschte, Alberto Azzo II. war der einzige Sohn von Albert Azzo I., Markgraf von Mailand. Er erbte die Ämter seines Vaters um 1020 und vergrößerte kontinuierlich seine Besitzungen in Norditalien, in den Jahren 1069-1070 versuchte er, Maine für seinen Sohn Hugh zu erwerben, weil seine Frau Garsende eine Miterbin der früheren Grafen von Maine war. Hugh wurde zum Grafen erklärt, aber er konnte sich nicht gegen Robert, den Herzog der Normandie, im Investiturstreit zwischen Heinrich IV., dem Heiligen Römischen Kaiser, und Papst Gregor VII., Azzo, durchsetzen versuchte zu vermitteln, aber später schloss er sich der Seite des Papstes an. Um 1073 machte er ein Schloss in Este zu seiner Residenz, aus dem das Haus Este vor seinem Bauprojekt Este kaum mehr als ein Dorf war. Sein Sohn Welf zog zuerst nach Kärnten und dann nach Bayern, was zu einer der wichtigsten Familien in der europäischen Geschichte führte, ein anderer Sohn, Fulk I. von Mailand, machte den ersten dokumentierten Gebrauch des Titels Marquis dEste. Azzo II heiratete Kunigunde, die Tochter von Welf II., Graf von Altdorf, und sie hatten ein bekanntes Kind, Welf Herzog von Bayern von 1070 bis 1077 und von 1096 bis zu seinem Tod, der das erste Mitglied der Welfen Zweig des Hauses Este war. Seine zweite Ehe war mit Garsende, Tochter von Herbert I, Graf von Maine, und sie hatten die folgenden bekannten Söhne, Fulco I, Markgraf von Mailand, Vorfahr des italienischen Zweiges des Hauses von Este Hugh V, Graf von Maine, hatte kein Problem. Einige Quellen sagen, dass er auch Vitalia Orseolo heiratete, Tochter von Peter Orseolo, und er hatte eine außereheliche Affäre mit Matilda, Schwester von William, Bischof von Padua, mit dem er eine Tochter namens Adelasia hatte, die Guglielmo Adelardi heiratete.

Er war das erste Mitglied der Welfenniederlassung des Hauses Este, in der Genealogie des Alten Hauses Welf wird er als Welf IV gezählt. Welf war der Sohn von Azzo II. von Este und dessen Frau Kunigunde von Altdorf, als Welfs Onkel mütterlicherseits, Welf, Herzog von Kärnten, kinderlos starb, Welf sein Eigentum erbte. Welf heiratete Ethelinde von Northeim, Tochter von Otto II., Herzog von Bayern, als sein Schwiegervater, Herzog Otto, ein Feind von König Heinrich IV. geworden war und sein Herzogtum verwirkte, blieb Welf dem König treu. In Übereinstimmung mit Henrys Befehlen lehnte er seine Herzogin Ethelinde ab und ließ sich scheiden, und dieses Ereignis fand 1070 in Goslar statt, als sich die Staaten Bayerns leise dem neu gebildeten Herzog unterwarfen, der der Vertreter einer der ältesten Familien der Provinz war. Seine Ablehnung der Herzogin, die als ein Akt der Ungerechtigkeit hätte angesehen werden können. Papst und Kaiser wurden im Jahr 1076 oberflächlich versöhnt, aber im Jahr sah sie wieder in aktiven Feindseligkeiten engagiert. Henry, in Folge der wiederholten Akte der Rebellion, erklärte Welf abgesetzt in seinem neu erworbenen Herzogtum. Unterstützt von seinen treuen Bayern und unterstützt von seinem Vater in Italien, konnte Welf seinen Platz behaupten, aber Gregor starb 1085 und seine Nachfolger nahmen eine weniger intensive Rolle in den Angelegenheiten Deutschlands ein. Nach der Scheidung heiratete Welf 1070 Judith von Flandern, Tochter von Balduin IV., Graf von Flandern, und die Witwe von Tostig Godwinson, Graf von Northumbria. Im Jahr 1089 heiratete Welfs Sohn Welf Matilda von der Toskana, so dass die Stärkung der Beziehungen mit dem Papst, aber nach der jüngeren Welf geschieden Matilda im Jahr 1095, Welf machte Wiedergutmachung mit König Heinrich IV und wurde in seiner Position als Herzog von Bayern bestätigt. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters Azzo im Jahr 1097 versuchte Welf, seinen Vätern Eigentum südlich der Alpen zu erwerben, im Jahr 1099 schloss sich Welf dem an, was als Kreuzzug von 1101 bekannt werden sollte, zusammen mit Wilhelm IX. von Aquitanien, Hugh von Vermandois und Ida von Österreich. Sein Haupterfolg war, einen Zusammenstoß zwischen Mitkreuzfahrern zu verhindern, die byzantinisches Territorium auf ihrem Weg nach Konstantinopel geplündert hatten, Welf selbst entkam dem Fiasko, starb aber auf seinem Weg zurück in Paphos, Zypern, im Jahre 1101 und wurde in Weingarten Abbey begraben.

Als junger Mann verwaltete er die Familien Este südlich der Alpen, durch seine Heirat mit Wulfhilde, Tochter des Herzogs Magnus von Sachsen, um 1095 erwarb er einen Teil der Billung Stände um Lüneburg. Er strebte danach, seinem Schwiegervater als sächsischer Herzog nachzufolgen, als Magnus 1106 ohne Erben starb. Herzog Heinrich hielt dennoch enge Beziehungen mit der regierenden Salian-Dynastie aufrecht, 1116 schloss er sich Kaiser Heinrich Vs zweitem italienischen Feldzug an, um die Stände der verstorbenen Markgräfin Matilda von der Toskana zu beschlagnahmen. Er folgte seinem älteren Bruder Welf II als bayerischer Herzog, als dieser 1120 kinderlos starb, war Heinrich auch maßgeblich an der Herbeiführung des Konkordates von Worms im Jahr 1122 beteiligt und beendete damit den langjährigen Investiturstreit zwischen Papst und Kaiser. Die Ehe wurde im Mai 1127 geschlossen, die Entfremdung zwischen den Dynastien Welf und Hohenstaufen dauerte bis ins 13. Jahrhundert.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Folgen Sie uns<br/><br/>SIND SIE EIN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Heißer Zucker? Hier ist, was Ihr Körper versucht, Ihnen zu sagen<br/><br/>von<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Abgesehen von der Gewichtszunahme durch außer Kontrolle geratene Heißhunger kann es frustrierend sein, ständig nach etwas Ungesundem zu streben und nicht zu wissen, warum. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass es normalerweise einen Grund gibt, der diesem brennenden Wunsch zugrunde liegt, eine Tüte Kartoffelchips unterzubringen, oder das Gefühl, dass Sie tatsächlich sterben könnten, wenn Sie nicht sofort eine Gurke bekommen (auch wenn Sie nicht schwanger sind). Wenn Sie zum Beispiel Visionen von Milchstraßenriegeln haben, könnte dies bedeuten, dass Ihnen ein sehr spezifischer Nährstoff in Ihrer Ernährung fehlt. (Yup - es ist komplizierter als gesagt, dass Schokoriegel so verdammt lecker sind.)<br/><br/>Wir sprachen mit der in Los Angeles ansässigen Ernährungsberaterin Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., um einige häufige Heißhungerattacken zu vermeiden, und was Sie tun können, um den Hunger zu stillen, ohne über Bord zu gehen. Scrollen Sie weiter, um einige wirklich gute Informationen zu erhalten!<br/><br/>Wenn Sie sich nach Schokolade sehnen<br/><br/>Es bedeutet: Es könnte Ihnen Magnesium in Ihrer Ernährung fehlen, sagt Lenchewski. "Magnesium ist ein essentielles Mineral, das an der Energieproduktion, dem Glukosestoffwechsel und der Muskelfunktion beteiligt ist. Dies gilt insbesondere für diejenigen, die hart ins Fitnessstudio gehen", erklärt sie. Darüber hinaus ist der Magnesiumspiegel in den prämenstruellen Wochen Ihrer Periode niedriger, was erklärt, warum PMS so oft mit Schokoladengelüsten einhergeht.<br/><br/>Stattdessen sollten Sie nach hochwertiger, zuckerarmer dunkler Schokolade greifen, die natürlich reich an Magnesium ist. „Ich empfehle, bei 75 Prozent Kakao oder höher zu bleiben und sie mit einer anderen magnesiumreichen Quelle wie Sonnenblumenkernen zu kombinieren“, sagt Lenchewski. Sie schlägt die Schokoladenmarke Hu vor, ein kleines Lebensmittelunternehmen, das sich auf hochwertige Zutaten konzentriert, die vor Ort hergestellt werden. "Es ist ein wenig teuer, aber umso mehr Grund, Portionen in Schach zu halten", sagt sie. "Es ist mein persönlicher Favorit." Wir sind auch große Fans von Superfood-verpackten Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie sich nach Süßigkeiten sehnen<br/><br/>Es bedeutet: "Die Zerkleinerung von reinem Zucker ist ein gutes Zeichen dafür, dass Sie wenig Energie haben", sagt Lenchewski. "Denken Sie darüber nach. Was juckt Sie nach einer schrecklichen Nachtruhe oder gegen 16 Uhr während eines stressigen Arbeitstages? Die Antwort ist normalerweise Zucker, weil er als sofortiger Brennstoff für die Zellen unseres Körpers verwendet wird.<br/><br/>Greifen Sie stattdessen nach Äpfeln mit Nussbutter. "Wenn Sie den Süßigkeitenstau Ihrer Kollegen überfallen, empfehle ich ein langsameres Kohlenhydrat mit einer Fett- oder Proteinquelle", sagt Lenchewski. "Im Gegensatz zu einfachem Zucker wird dies Ihre Zellen anheizen und gleichzeitig den Post-Zucker-Crash vermeiden. Zwei Optionen, die für große Pick-me-ups machen das nächste Mal, wenn Sie Süßigkeiten sehnen: ein geschnittener Apfel mit Ihrer Wahl von Nussbutter oder Beeren mit 2% ungesüßtem griechischen Joghurt. Wir mögen es auch, einen süßen Zahn mit diesen süchtig machenden Kokosnusschips zu schlagen - sie füllen sich, sind frei von Zuckerzusatz und einfach so gut.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie sich nach Salz sehnen<br/><br/>Es bedeutet: "Wenn nichts als die salzigste Gurke tut, trinken Sie vielleicht nicht genug H2O", sagt Lenchewski. "Salz hilft dem Körper, sich an Wasser zu halten, also sehnen wir uns danach, wenn wir Flüssigkeit brauchen."<br/><br/>Greifen Sie stattdessen nach Wasser. "Bleiben Sie hydratisiert, besonders wenn wir uns den Sommermonaten nähern", sagt sie. Wenn das nächste Mal ein Verlangen aufkommt, versuchen Sie es (buchstäblich) mit ein paar erfrischenden Gläsern zu löschen und Sie könnten feststellen, dass die Dringlichkeit von Natrium Binge verschwindet. "Wenn Sie mit klarem Wasser gelangweilt sind, geben Sie Minze, Zitrone oder gefrorenes Obst hinzu, um es zu vermischen", sagt Lenchewski. Und wenn das immer noch nicht der Fall ist, gibt es eine gesündere Alternative zu Chips oder Pommes. "Wenn Sie sich wirklich nur nach Salz sehnen, ist gerösteter Seetang eine großartige kalorienarme Option", sagt sie.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie sich nach stärkehaltigen Kohlenhydraten wie Pasta sehnen<br/><br/>Es bedeutet: "Weil kohlenhydratreiche Lebensmittel das Wohlfühlhormon Serotonin steigern, kann das Verlangen nach Stärke ein Zeichen dafür sein, dass Sie einen Stimmungsbooster benötigen", sagt Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Greifen Sie stattdessen nach einem Bad! "Entleeren Sie die Bittersalze, denn es ist Zeit für eine ernsthafte R + R", sagt Lenchewski. "Vertrauen Sie mir. Das Einlassen einer Stärke für alle fühlt sich im Moment wirklich gut an, aber es wird Sie wahrscheinlich am nächsten Tag mehr austricksen." (Wie jeder, der jemals ein Verlangen nach Pizza oder Pasta zu sehr genossen hat, weiß.) Das nächste Mal, wenn Sie also den Kopf zuerst in eine Schüssel mit Kohlenhydraten tauchen möchten, ziehen Sie ein Bad, zünden Sie eine Kerze an und gönnen Sie sich ohne Bedauern oder dichte Kalorien.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie sich nach Eiscreme sehnen<br/><br/>5/6<br/><br/>Es bedeutet: "Ihr Körper kann Ihnen sagen, dass er etwas gesundes Fett braucht."<br/><br/>"Ich bin ein Realist, also wenn Sie sich nach Eis sehnen, werde ich nicht eine Handvoll Walnüsse empfehlen, die natürlich voller gesundem Fett sind", sagt Lenchewski. "Für Eiscreme-Notfälle empfehle ich Kokosnuss-Eiscreme mit niedrigem Zuckergehalt wie Coconut Bliss oder Kippys Drei-Zutaten-Eiscreme in Los Angeles." Wir können dafür bürgen, dass Kokosnuss-Eiscreme unglaublich schmeckt und genau wie das echte Ding.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie sich nach einem Burger sehnen<br/><br/>Es bedeutet: Du brauchst Eisen. "Wenn du nicht aufhören kannst, an rotes Fleisch zu denken, besteht die Möglichkeit, dass dein Körper sich nach Eisen, B12 und Folsäure sehnt", sagt Lenchewski. "Dies gilt besonders während oder um diese Zeit des Monats."<br/><br/>Stattdessen sollten Sie nach einem gesünderen Burger greifen. "Ich bin einmal pro Woche ein Befürworter von grasgefüttertem, antibiotischem und hormonfreiem rotem Fleisch", sagt Lenchewski. "Versuchen Sie, mit einem offenen Bison-Burger zu experimentieren - der, geschnitten für den Schnitt, schlanker ist und mehr Eisen als Rindfleisch hat." Versuchen Sie, eine Art pflanzliche Eisenergänzung in Ihre Routine zu integrieren, wie Spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Web-Services, Anbieter und Cyber-Gesetze!<br/><br/>Aktualisiert am:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Die Computerisierung dieser Welt hat das menschliche Leistungsszenario stark verändert und das auch über die Messung hinaus. Zum Beispiel können Sie jetzt wichtige Informationen mit einem einzigen Mausklick auf der ganzen Welt senden, dank der Internetverbindung. Leider ist es diese breite Konnektivität und Popularität unter den Menschen, Internet hat auch die Chancen für Computerverbrechen erhöht. Internet-Verbrechen oder Computerverbrechen sind weithin als "Cyber-Verbrechen" bekannt.<br/><br/>Cyber-Gesetze sind etwas Neues im Justizsystem, haben aber in letzter Zeit viel Aufmerksamkeit gewonnen. Der Begriff Cyber-Kriminalität ist etwas sehr Synonyms für konventionelle Kriminalität, der einzige Unterschied ist das Medium der Hinrichtung. Es gibt hauptsächlich zwei Arten von Cyberkriminalität, die erste ist, bei der Computer die Hauptziele sind und dazu gehören Fälle von Datenschäden, bösartigem Code und sogar kriminellem Datenzugriff. Der zweite ist, in dem Computer nur ein Werkzeug ist, mit dem herkömmliche Verbrechen für zB Cyber-Terrorismus, Spamming, Cyber-Stalking und vieles mehr begangen werden.<br/><br/>Dies ist, wo ein Website-Berater oder ein Anbieter in Szene tritt. Obwohl nicht alle Cyber-Gesetze bis heute kennen, kann ein Website-Anbieter Sie über einige der wichtigsten Cyber-Gesetze beraten, während Sie Ihre Website erstellen.<br/><br/>Dies kann das allgemeine Wissen über Kopierrechte oder sogar den Schutz des Inhalts Ihrer eigenen Website umfassen. Die Erklärung aller Rechte, die Sie als Website-Inhaber besitzen, ist auch eine der Aufgaben, die ein Website-Anbieter bei der Entwicklung Ihrer Website ausführen kann. Ein Anbieter kann Ihnen auch helfen, indem er Ihnen Informationen zu verschiedenen Cybergesetzen zum Schutz von Daten zur Verfügung stellt. Darüber hinaus kann ein Anbieter Ihnen auch Informationen zu neuen Cybergesetzen zur Verfügung stellen, die Sie möglicherweise erst kennen. Cyber-Gesetze können von Nation zu Nation variieren, ein aktuelles Beispiel kann das in Großbritannien veröffentlichte Cookie-Gesetz sein, das verhindert, dass die Website Browsing-Daten von Benutzern speichert. Gemäß dem Cookie-Gesetz können Websites in Großbritannien keine Cookie-Dateien ohne die Zustimmung des Surfers speichern.<br/><br/>Es ist nach der Umsetzung eines solchen Gesetzes, Websites haben jetzt ein Pop-up-Fenster, das die Zustimmung des Besuchers für die Speicherung von Cookies-Dateien sucht. Solche Dateien werden von Websites verwendet, um das Surfmuster von Besuchern zu analysieren, basierend darauf, welche Anzeigen dann in einem Benutzerfenster veröffentlicht werden. Da Hacking für uns alle keine neue Sache mehr ist, glauben Sie, dass solche Regeln und Vorschriften Online-Fälschungen oder Cyberkriminalität verhindern können? Die Technologie hat sich rasant entwickelt, aber die Leute bevorzugen es immer noch nicht, online zu kaufen, weil sie Angst haben, dass persönliche oder Bankkontodaten gehackt werden. Mit dem Anstieg der Cyberkriminalität ist auch der Bedarf an strengen Cybergesetzen gestiegen, um das gleiche einzudämmen und ein risikofreies Einkaufserlebnis zu fördern.<br/><br/>Klassen von Cyber-Kriminalität<br/><br/>Im Laufe der Jahre gab es drei Hauptkategorien von Cyber-Kriminalität:<br/><br/>Unbefugter Zugriff auf Computersystemfälle, bei denen Benutzernamen und Passwörter gehackt oder gestohlen werden, um Zugriff auf persönliche Informationen des jeweiligen Benutzers zu erhalten. Diese Art von Backdoor-Zugriff wird mit Hilfe von Trojan Horse organisiert. Freisetzung bösartiger Programme wie Trojan House, Würmer oder Computerviren usw. Die letzte Klasse umfasst Cyber-Stalking eines Benutzers oder Online-Belästigung.<br/><br/>Direkte Auswirkungen von Cyber-Kriminalität<br/><br/>Umsatzrückgang<br/><br/>Reduzierung der Mitarbeiterleistung aufgrund von Netzwerkverzögerungen<br/><br/>Verlust personalisierter Informationen wie Forschungsarbeiten<br/><br/>Störung im Kommunikationsprozess<br/><br/>Indirekte Auswirkungen von Cyber-Kriminalität<br/><br/>Glaubwürdigkeit in unserem Finanzsystem<br/><br/>Markenimage wird auf dem Markt getrübt<br/><br/>Cyber-Kriminalität beeinflusst Geschäftsbeziehungen auf dem Markt<br/><br/>Das Gefühl des Vertrauens in die staatliche Politik und die Regierungsbehörden ist verloren<br/><br/>Verhinderung von Cyberkriminalität<br/><br/>Als Netizens gibt es bestimmte Vorsichtsmaßnahmen, die wir für eine sichere Online-Erfahrung in Betracht ziehen sollten. Hier sind einige von ihnen:<br/><br/>Das erste, was zu tun ist, ist, persönliche informationen für sich selbst zu behalten und zu vermeiden, die gleichen online zu teilen.<br/><br/>Vermeiden sie es, fotos mit online-chat-freunden oder fremden zu teilen.<br/><br/>Die Installation der neuesten Version von Anti-Virus auf Ihrem System kann Ihnen eine gute Verteidigungslinie gegen Internetbedrohungen wie Viren und Malware bieten.<br/><br/>Die Sicherung Ihrer wertvollen Daten ist eine gute Option, um Probleme wie Viruskontamination zu vermeiden.<br/><br/>Vermeiden Sie es, Kreditkarteninformationen an Websites zu senden, die ungesichert sind und über kein gültiges Zertifikat verfügen.<br/><br/>Installation eines Sicherheitsprogramms, das Ihnen die Kontrolle über Website-Cookies bietet und Sie davor bewahrt, von Websites verfolgt zu werden.<br/><br/>Wenn Sie hostbasierte Intrusions-Erkennungsgeräte auf Servern installieren, können Sie Unregelmäßigkeiten auf Ihrem Website-Traffic verfolgen.<br/><br/>Die Verwendung von Firewalls wird empfohlen.<br/><br/>Warum sind Cyberangriffe so beliebt?<br/><br/>Günstiger als herkömmliche Betrugsmethoden<br/><br/>Die Verfolgung von Cyberkriminalität ist nicht einfach<br/><br/>Exakte Standorte lassen sich nicht einfach nachverfolgen<br/><br/>Fehlende physische Barrieren in der Welt des Internets<br/><br/>Cyberkriminalität betrifft eine große Anzahl von Menschen<br/><br/>Schlussfolgerung<br/><br/>Die Tatsache, dass der menschliche Geist eine unergründliche Macht hat, ist unbestreitbar, weshalb die Internetkriminalität enorm zunimmt. Sogar die Geschichte hat einige der größten Internet-Sicherheit erlebt, die von Hackern kaputt wurden, die auch leicht davongekommen sind. Die einzige Möglichkeit, solche Verbrechen einzudämmen, besteht darin, sich der Cybergesetze bewusst zu bleiben, die wir heute haben, die entweder über das Internet oder über Website / IT-Anbieter erfolgen können. Das Informationstechnologiegesetz muss so ausgewogen sein, dass es sich für Menschen, die an Cyberkriminalität beteiligt sind, als zu streng erweist und gleichzeitig das Wachstum der Internetindustrie niemals behindern sollte.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri leitet derzeit ein hochwertiges Webdesign-Unternehmen mit Sitz in Neu-Delhi, Indien.
