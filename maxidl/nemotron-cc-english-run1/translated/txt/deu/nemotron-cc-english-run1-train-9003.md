| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses. What an exciting hub. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko from Texas on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Following Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"The pure white of the lily's skin<br/><br/>Speaks of no beauty from within<br/><br/>Just Monet's way or goal<br/><br/>For feasting eyes<br/><br/>Not feasting for the soul"<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for returning Kim, I'm so pleased with the responses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense. If it does not work, please feel free to delete and I will try again. | Das Meisterwerk: eine Herausforderung für die Kettendichtung<br/><br/>John schreibt seit seiner Schulzeit Gedichte und wurde mit den "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards ausgezeichnet.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in einem japanischen Kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Eine kurze Geschichte der kollaborativen, kollektiven oder Kettendichtung<br/><br/>Kollaborative, kollektive oder Kettenpoesie ist eine alternative und kreative Technik, um Gedichte von mehr als einer Person zu schreiben. Das Hauptziel dieser Art von Poesie ist es, Gedichte durch die Zusammenarbeit verschiedener Autoren / Dichter zu schaffen, die versuchen, eine einheitliche Stimme zu bilden, während sie ihre individuellen Stimmen beibehalten.<br/><br/>Beispiele für Zusammenarbeit gibt es in der japanischen Poesie. Obwohl die genauen Berichte und Aufzeichnungen über viele solcher Ereignisse entweder verloren gehen oder fehlen.<br/><br/>Eines der bekanntesten Beispiele für kollektives Gedichtschreiben war die Gedichtsammlung Ralentir Travaux der surrealistischen französischen Dichter André Breton, Paul Éluard und René Char. Diese drei Dichter arbeiteten 1930 zusammen, um die Gedichte in dieser Sammlung über nur fünf Tage zu schreiben.<br/><br/>Während der 1940er Jahre erfand Charles Henri Ford, ein amerikanischer Dichter, was er das "Kettengedicht" nannte, wo jeder Dichter eine Zeile schrieb und dann das Gedicht an eine andere Person in einem anderen Teil der Welt per Post schickte.<br/><br/>Im Jahr 2007 wurde eine Sammlung von amerikanischen Collaborative Poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry von Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton und David Trinidad herausgegeben.<br/><br/>Collaborative Poetry Writing wurde in Schulen und Colleges verwendet, um den Schülern Teamarbeit zu vermitteln und Wege zu finden, wie sie miteinander verbunden sind.<br/><br/>Studie einer Figur im Freien: Frau mit Sonnenschirm, nach links, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain oder Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Das Ziel dieses Artikels und wie man die Herausforderung angehen kann<br/><br/>Vor ein paar Jahren schrieb ich einen Artikel mit dem Titel "Gedicht ohne Ende", der ein Weihnachtsgedicht enthielt, das ich geschrieben hatte, das dazu diente, hinzugefügt zu werden. Ich war erstaunt über die Antwort, da ich zu diesem Zeitpunkt nur ein paar Anhänger hier hatte. Die Leute schrieben eine Strophe mit Gedichten, jeweils in "Kommentaren" auf der Nabe, um der Strophe des vorherigen Kommentators zu folgen. Es hat sehr gut geklappt und am Ende habe ich alle Beiträge zu einem einzigen Gedicht als Teil der Nabe zusammengestellt.<br/><br/>Ähnliche Herausforderungen wurden seitdem herausgegeben, darunter eine von Frank Atanacio namens "Spirits Sat as Mourners", die ebenfalls sehr erfolgreich war. Der Unterschied besteht darin, dass die Mitwirkenden in diesem Fall ihre eigenen Hubs für ihre Strophe der Poesie schrieben und einen Link auf Franks ursprünglichem Hub platzierten.<br/><br/>Für diese besondere Herausforderung erwarte ich nicht, dass jeder wertvolle Zeit damit verbringt, separate Hubs für eine Strophe Poesie zu schreiben (es sei denn, Sie möchten es wirklich). Das Hauptproblem ist, dass Sie, um es effektiv zu machen, die zuvor geschriebenen Teile des Gedichts auf Ihren Hub kopieren müssen und wahrscheinlich mit dem Label "Duplizierung" versehen werden.<br/><br/>Also, das ist der Fall, und auch, um zu sparen, Links überall zu verlassen, bitte ich nur, dass jeder, der teilnehmen will, schreiben Sie einfach ihre Strophe hier in "Kommentare." Überprüfen Sie den letzten Kommentar vor Ihnen, der zur Herausforderung beiträgt und folgen Sie weiter. Wenn ich mehr als eine Folge aus derselben Strophe sehe, werde ich meine poetische Lizenz nutzen, um sie so zu bearbeiten, wie ich es für am besten halte.<br/><br/>Irgendwann, wenn ich das Gefühl habe, dass genug Strophen hinzugefügt wurden, werde ich wahrscheinlich der Herausforderung ein Ende bereiten und sie dann alle als fertiges Gedicht als Teil des Artikels zusammenstellen (auch jedem Mitwirkenden Anerkennung zollen).<br/><br/>Blühende Flussufer, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Die Herausforderung!<br/><br/>Jetzt kommt der interessante Teil. Wenn Sie sich dieser Kettenpoesie-Herausforderung anschließen, müssen Sie versuchen, den Stil und die Stimme des Gedichts so nah wie möglich an den vorherigen Versen zu halten, so dass es für uninformierte Leser den Anschein hat, dass nur ein Autor das gesamte Gedicht geschrieben hat.<br/><br/>Klingt einfach, sagen Sie? Nun, vielleicht wäre es, wenn das Gedicht einen traditionellen Stil, Reim oder Meter hatte. Aber das hier nicht! Das Gedicht, das Sie hinzufügen werden, wurde von einem Bekannten von mir Andriealphus als "Kettengedicht Herausforderung" anderswo gestartet. Zum Zeitpunkt des Schreibens war ich die einzige andere Person, die die Herausforderung angenommen hatte, und weil ich das Thema liebte, dachte ich, dass es eine große Herausforderung für meine Mitautoren sein würde und beschloss, es hier zu verwenden und zu sehen, ob die Antwort besser wäre. (Ich kenne einige Dichter hier, deren Schreiben zu diesem Stil passen würde)<br/><br/>Regeln:<br/><br/>Verfolgen Sie die vorherige Strophe in Kommentaren<br/><br/>Versuchen Sie, die Stimme und den Stil des Gedichts zu behalten<br/><br/>Halten Sie Ihre Strophe/Verse ungefähr so lang wie zuvor<br/><br/>Claude Monet war einer der berühmtesten Maler in der Kunstgeschichte und eine führende Figur in der impressionistischen Bewegung.<br/><br/>1883 zog Monet nach Giverny, wo er in den Gärten, die er mitgestaltete, gerne im Freien malte. Die Seerosen, die im Teich gefunden wurden, hatten eine besondere Anziehungskraft, und er malte mehrere Serien von ihnen während des Rests seines Lebens; die Brücke im japanischen Stil über den Teich wurde auch Gegenstand mehrerer Werke.<br/><br/>1912 malte Monet eine Serie von 12 Seerosengemälden, die von der Orangerie des Tuileries, einem Museum in Paris, in Auftrag gegeben wurden. Er entschied sich, sie in einem sehr großen Maßstab herzustellen und als "Hafen friedlicher Meditation" zu dienen. Dieses Projekt verbraucht viel von Monets späteren Jahren. Monet sagte einmal: "Diese Landschaften von Wasser und Reflexion sind zu einer Obsession für mich geworden. Es ist jenseits meiner Stärke als alter Mann, und doch möchte ich wiedergeben, was ich fühle."<br/><br/>Seine Gesundheit war jetzt auch ein Hindernis. Fast blind, mit beiden Augen ernsthaft von Katarakten betroffen, Monet schließlich vereinbart, sich einer Operation für die Krankheit im Jahr 1923.<br/><br/>Monets berühmte Seerosen wurden röter, als seine Katarakte vorankamen. Nach einer korrigierenden Operation zerstörte er die meisten der "roten Lilien" -Gemälde, wütend, dass niemand es ihm wirklich sagte. Ironischerweise waren diese Gemälde wahrscheinlich das, was seinen impressionistischen Stil in dieser Zeit so berühmt machte - Künstler begannen in dieser Zeit mehr Risiken mit Farbe und dergleichen einzugehen.<br/><br/>Das Meisterwerk<br/><br/>"Der Junge, der hinter dir sitzt, sagt, dass du wie ein Meisterwerk aussiehst.<br/><br/>Fragen Sie ihn, hat er jemals einen Monet aus der Nähe gesehen?<br/><br/>Nah genug, um nichts als verworrene Striche des grasigen Seeufers zu sehen?<br/><br/>Nah genug, um seine Finger in die Grate zu tauchen<br/><br/>wo Ölfarben unter dem Blick eines Künstlers gehärtet werden?<br/><br/>Nah genug, um auf die Blutlilien zu atmen?<br/><br/>Fragt ihn, warum er sie rot gemalt hat?“ (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Er grinste wie Carrolls Cheshire-Katze.<br/><br/>"Durch getrübte und blutunterlaufene Augen stelle ich mir vor.<br/><br/>Sei meine Seerosen!", sagt er.<br/><br/>"Fühle meinen Atem und lass meine Finger eintauchen,<br/><br/>Werde stattdessen mein Meisterstück.<br/><br/>Ein Pinsel hat noch nie eine Leinwand so fein berührt wie Ihre helle Haut.<br/><br/>Mögen die Herren weinen vor Eifersucht,<br/><br/>und Van Gogh schneidet sein Ohr vor Neid auf die Schönheit deiner Nacktheit.“ (Jodah)<br/><br/>Selbstporträt mit bandagiertem Ohr<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Antworten<br/><br/>Jetzt sind Sie dran.

Und die Schönheit, die wir heute noch von all seinen Arbeiten genießen können.<br/><br/>Das ist eine große Herausforderung! Ich freue mich wirklich darauf, dazu beizutragen.<br/><br/>Ich wollte zuerst reinkommen und euch das wissen lassen, ganz sicher.<br/><br/>Und vielen Dank für all die Herausforderungen, um dem Rest von uns zu helfen, unsere mentale Energie fließen zu lassen und es zu trainieren! Du bist der Beste.<br/><br/>Die Informationen über LuLu und die kostenlose ISBN-Nummer ist ein beantwortetes Gebet! Also, lächeln mein Freund. Sie sind ein Geschenk!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 12. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo wieder Marj. Ich denke, ich habe vielleicht alle Verse, die kommen werden. Ich habe mein Bestes getan, um sie so zu arrangieren, wie ich es am besten mit nur ein wenig Bearbeitung denke. Ich werde wahrscheinlich das fertige Gedicht als separaten Hub mit einem Link dazu posten. Mein Buch ist auf Lulu und iBooks verfügbar... es gibt einen Link zu einem der früheren Kommentare. Ich würde es wirklich zu schätzen wissen, wenn Sie eine Kopie verfolgen würden. Denken Sie daran, es ist mein erstes eBook, so dass die Formatierung usw. nicht perfekt ist, aber es hat mich sieben Revisionen genommen Ich denke, es zu bekommen, wo es ist. Es wird alles beim nächsten Mal einfacher sein. Wenn Sie Hilfe brauchen, lassen Sie es mich wissen.<br/><br/>travmaj aus Australien am 12. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo John, Sie haben sicherlich einige ausgezeichnete Antworten auf Ihre Herausforderung gehabt - ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie es ganz schön verschmelzen werden, obwohl ich mir eine schwierige Aufgabe vorstelle. Ich interessiere mich auch für deine Poesiebücher - ich muss wirklich technologisch zusammenkommen - ich werde versuchen, alles zu überprüfen...<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 11. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo Jo, beide Bücher 'On the Wings of Eagles' und "I Laughed a Smile" haben meist den gleichen Inhalt... außer das erstere hat ein zusätzliches Gedicht. Ursprünglich waren sie in verschiedenen Formaten, ein ePub, das andere PDF, aber jetzt sind sie beide ePub. Sie sind über Lulu und iBooks verfügbar, bald Barnes and Noble und Nook (nicht Amazon). Ich kann versuchen, ein anderes Buch über Amazon bald zu veröffentlichen, nur um zu sehen, wie es sich vergleicht. Nochmals vielen Dank.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues aus Lincolnshire, Großbritannien am 11. August 2015:<br/><br/>John, vielen Dank, die Informationen über das Veröffentlichen mit Lulu werden sehr nützlich sein, da ich an das Veröffentlichen denke, aber ich bin derzeit zwischen Amazon und Lulu hin- und hergerissen. Ich wollte eines Ihrer Bücher kaufen, aber ich konnte sie auf Amazon nicht finden. Aber ich werde es wahrscheinlich von Lulu bekommen. Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg, Sie verdienen es.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 11. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, danke fürs Zuschreiben. Ich mag es, ein perfektes Ende des Gedichts, denke ich.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 11. August 2015:<br/><br/>Danke, Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 11. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo Jo, ich denke, ich habe das Gedicht zufriedenstellend aussortiert. Ich warte nur darauf, ob es noch mehr zu ergänzen gibt. Das Veröffentlichen mit Lulu war nicht schlecht und jetzt, wo ich es einmal getan habe, wird es beim nächsten Mal einfacher sein. Die Formatierung im eBook war am schwierigsten, obwohl Sie es einfach in ein Word-Dokument eingeben und Lulu automatisch die Inhaltsseite erstellt und das Dokument in ePub oder PDF konvertiert, können Sie nur bestimmte Schriftarten verwenden und müssen sicherstellen, dass sich die Kapitelnamen oder Gedichttitel in Überschrift 1 befinden. Sie bieten auch eine kostenlose ISBN-Nummer, wenn Sie möchten. Insgesamt war es jedoch einfacher als erwartet.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues aus Lincolnshire, Großbritannien am 11. August 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, das ist prägnant und schön, ich liebe es. Shyron hat auch einen ausgezeichneten Job gemacht, ich dachte, ich hätte ihren Vers bereits kommentiert, aber ich hatte es nicht.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle brennt aus der hohen Wüste von Nevada. am 10.

August 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, wunderschön gemacht, finde ich es unglaublich, wie jemand mit so begrenzter Vision uns so viel über Schönheit, Licht und Schatten lehren kann. John, ich freue mich darauf, das Endergebnis zu lesen.<br/><br/>Übrigens, Congtats über die Veröffentlichung Ihrer Gedichte. Wie haben Sie den Prozess der Veröffentlichung mit Lulu gefunden?<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 10. August 2015:<br/><br/>Nein, es ist noch nicht zu spät, ich kompiliere immer noch das letzte Gedicht, also sollte es für alle in ein oder zwei Tagen zu sehen sein.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper aus dem Süden der USA am 10. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo John,<br/><br/>Ich entschuldige mich für meine späte Einreichung hier zu Ihrer wunderbaren Herausforderung. Ich bin ein paar Tage von der Arbeit und beschloss, dies zu versuchen, während mein Mann von der Knieoperation ruht.

Vielen Dank an alle, die dazu beigetragen haben.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 02. August 2015:<br/><br/>Vielen Dank Genna. Es scheint, Monet ist ein Lieblings-Arist von vielen hier. Ich hoffe, Sie werden an dieser Herausforderung auch teilnehmen :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 02. August 2015:<br/><br/>Vielen Dank für einen tollen Beitrag Shyron. Dies ist ein sehr schöner Vers. Gut gemacht.<br/><br/>Genna East aus Massachusetts, USA am 02. August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo John...<br/><br/>Ich fing an, diese wunderbare Herausforderung zu lesen (Monet ist einer meiner Lieblingskünstler), dann kam ich zurück, um einige der schönen Beiträge zu lesen, die diesem Gemälde eine atemberaubende Stimme durch Wahrnehmung und die Sinne geben.

August 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo John, 'sublime' wird sich gut machen. Ich bin so froh, dass dir mein Beitrag gefällt. Das ist eine sehr gute Idee, ich weiß, dass du Spaß daran haben wirst, alles zusammenzustellen. Pass auf dich auf und mein Bestes.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>Danke Deb, ja, ich bin beeindruckt von dem Standard der Einreichungen. Ich freue mich darauf, alles zusammenzustellen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Ann, es ist gut zu sehen, dass die Dichter unter uns die Herausforderung mit einigen großartigen Beiträgen annehmen. Ich hoffe nur, dass Imcan es gerecht machen kann, wenn es darum geht, es zusammenzustellen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>Gut gemacht Jo. Das Wort "erhaben" kommt mir in den Sinn. Ich hoffte, dass alle Dichter in den Vordergrund treten würden, und das haben sie. Lieben Sie es, danke für Ihren Beitrag.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt aus Stillwater, OK am 1. August 2015:<br/><br/>Ich freue mich zu sehen, was Sie hier am Ende.

August 2015:<br/><br/>Großartig, Jo!<br/><br/>Du bringst alle in Bewegung, John, und nicht mich, wenn du das alles zusammenstellst, aber es wird ein Gedicht summen, wenn es endlich zu Ende geht - wenn es das jemals tut! Du hast wirklich etwas angefangen.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues aus Lincolnshire, Großbritannien am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>Ich hoffe, es liest sich gut.<br/><br/>Und der Junge begann wegzugehen<br/><br/>Aber in seinem Kielwasser hörte ich ihn sagen<br/><br/>"Ich habe eine Reise nach Orangerie<br/><br/>Wo der Geist von Monet noch wohnt<br/><br/>Ich setzte mich hin und schaute eine Weile<br/><br/>Bis ich eine leise Stimme weinen hörte.<br/><br/>"Haben Sie schon einmal einen flüssigen Traum gesehen?<br/><br/>Wo sich Licht zu dem entwickelt, was es berührt<br/><br/>Wo Gelassenheit durch bewölkten Schleier fließt<br/><br/>Wo die Bürste des Magiers wie Aufhellung Eile<br/><br/>Hast du jemals einen erhabenen Anblick gesehen?<br/><br/>Ein Kind, das aus verzerrter Illusion geboren wurde<br/><br/>Dieser blühende Teich, der das Licht einfängt<br/><br/>Das hebt das Herz und winkt die Seele<br/><br/>Eine abstrakte Pulchritude aus der Nähe<br/><br/>Kehren Sie zurück, siehe, eine solche ruhige Freude.

Mein Bestes...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues aus Lincolnshire, Großbritannien am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>Alles klar!<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>Ja, Jo, bitte. Jeder ist willkommen, mehr als eine Strophe zu machen. Ich kann eine andere hinzufügen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues aus Lincolnshire, Großbritannien am 01. August 2015:<br/><br/>John, ich habe beschlossen, es zu versuchen, aber es sind ungefähr 16 Zeilen, kann ich es in zwei Strophen nach Kims wunderbarer Einreichung tun? Du kannst es immer später bearbeiten.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 31. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo Jo, es tut mir leid zu hören, dass du im Moment unter dem Wetter bist. Ich habe es nicht eilig, diese Herausforderung zu beenden, also werde ich sie offen halten, bis du wieder auf allen Zylindern feuerst und in der Lage bist, etwas beizutragen. Sie sind einer der Hubber, auf die ich mich gefreut habe, eine Antwort zu bekommen, von der ich dachte, dass sie passen würde. Vielen Dank für Ihre freundlichen Worte, und bald wieder gesund zu werden.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues aus Lincolnshire, Großbritannien am 31. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Ich kann nicht glauben, dass ich deine unglaubliche Herausforderung fast verpasst hätte. Dies ist etwas, an dem ich gerne teilgenommen hätte, da Claude Monet einer meiner Lieblingskünstler aller Zeiten ist. Leider muss ich weinen. Ich bin ein bisschen unter dem Wetter mit einem Kopf voller Watte, oder so scheint es. Wenn die Herausforderung noch offen ist, wenn ich diese lästige Grippe los werde, kann ich es versuchen, aber ich muss sagen, der Standard ist außergewöhnlich hoch. Maj brachte es auf eine andere Ebene, aber alle Einreichungen sind brillant. Kudos an Sie Andriealphus und die anderen Autoren, die bisher in diesem künstlerischen und kreativen Meisterwerk teilgenommen.<br/><br/>Mein bestes immer Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 31. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo wieder Maj, froh, dass dieses Gedicht dich inspiriert hat, und ja, es schlägt das Cricket zu beobachten, vor allem mit den Aussie Batsmen schlecht in diesem dritten Test. Es wird eine interessante Übung für mich sein, alle Strophen zusammen zu verschmelzen, aber sollte gut sein.<br/><br/>travmaj aus Australien am 30. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>John, danke, ich bin sehr froh, dass dir mein Angebot gefällt. Ich fand das Gedicht faszinierend und fühlte mich plötzlich inspiriert, meine Version im gleichen Modus zu schreiben. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob ich vorher eine Fortsetzung aus der Strophe geschrieben habe (immer erforschend), aber ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie sie zusammenfügen werden, wenn die Zeit gekommen ist. Ich habe kein kreatives Schreiben für Yonks geschafft, kann es kaum erwarten, von vorne anzufangen, brauche nur etwas Zeit. (schlägt auch das Cricket an!!!) Cheers John, werde einchecken -<br/><br/>John Hansen (Autor) aus Gondwana Land am 30. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>Vielen Dank für die Überprüfung Dana. Ich bin zufrieden mit der Qualität der Antworten so weit. Ich muss nur warten und sehen, wie viele mehr kommen. Das Finale, Gedicht sollte groß sein.<br/><br/>Dana Tate von LOS ANGELES am 30. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>Ich checke nur ein, um zu sehen, wie es läuft, ich kann es kaum erwarten, das fertige Produkt zu sehen. Ich habe an einem Poesiekurs teilgenommen und wir haben das auch gemacht, es hat wirklich Spaß gemacht.<br/><br/>ocfireflies aus North Carolina am 29.

Ich bin so zufrieden mit der Qualität der Antworten so weit.<br/><br/>ocfireflies aus North Carolina am 29. Juli 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Ich hatte dies früher vor travmajs tollem Beitrag geschickt, aber vielleicht funktioniert es immer noch (ich habe ein wenig gezwickt)<br/><br/>Im Gegensatz zu früher - ich weiß nicht, ob<br/><br/>Ich mache jeden Sinn. Wenn es nicht funktioniert, fühlen Sie bitte sich frei zu löschen und ich werde es erneut versuchen. |

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Zunächst muss EEQT selbst weiterentwickelt werden, um eine theoretische und rechnerische Antwort auf die Bedürfnisse der modernen Quantentechnik und -technologie zu liefern. Wir müssen klassische Systeme mit unendlich vielen Freiheitsgraden einbeziehen - wie elektromagnetisches und/oder Gravitationsfeld. Wir müssen auch unendliche Quantensysteme einbeziehen, um Bose-Gas und seine Phasenübergänge zu verstehen und zu simulieren. Aber es gibt auch Schritte, die weit über das Paradigma von EEQT hinaus unternommen werden müssen.<br/>Wie wir schon so oft betont haben: Die Quantentheorie muss erst noch im Sinne einer "nichtlinearen klassischen Theorie" verstanden werden. Aber was wir mit einer "klassischen Theorie" meinen, ist etwas viel fortgeschritteneres und allgemeineres als die klasische Mechanik oder die klassische Feldtheorie. Unter einer "klassischen Theorie" verstehen wir zunächst eine Theorie, die nicht von Anfang an auf Wahrscheinlichkeiten beruht; eine Theorie, in der Wahrscheinlichkeiten zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt auftreten, abgeleitet von der Theorie; vielleicht in notwendiger Weise abgeleitet. Eine solche Theorie muss nicht nur die mathematischen Objekte und ihre Beziehungen spezifizieren, sondern auch "Vorhersagen" machen.<br/>Eine klassische Theorie ist insbesondere eine Theorie, in der diskrete Ereignisse auftreten können, Ereignisse, die "objektiv" sind. Sie können Ereignisse sein, die hauptsächlich die physische Schicht betreffen, aber sie können auch "mentale Ereignisse" sein, Veränderungen von Zuständen des "Bewusstseins"; was auch immer sie sind, selbst wenn sie sich mit Verzweigungen von Universen befassen - sie HABEN.<br/>Eine solche Theorie, die die Quantentheorie, wie wir sie heute kennen, umfasst, existiert noch nicht, aber wir können uns ihre mögliche Form vorstellen. Nichts dient besser als ein Beispiel, also lassen Sie uns hier ein Beispiel dafür geben, wie eine solche Theorie ausgelegt werden kann.<br/>Stellen Sie sich eine Theorie entwickelt a'la Einsteins einheitliche Feldtheorie, aber mit variabler metrischer Signatur, möglicherweise mit einem komplexen kausalen Netz, mehrere<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (siehe auch [41]) Brücken, Zeitschleifen, Ununterscheidbarkeit, fraktale Struktur, all das zusätzlich kompliziert durch variable Dimensionalität von Raum und "Zeit" (vgl. [42]). Stellen Sie sich eine solche Theorie vor, um alle vier uns bekannten fundamentalen Kräfte aufnehmen zu können, aber sie beinhaltet auch ein zusätzliches Feld, das sich von physischen Feldern unterscheidet und das in dem Sinne nicht lokal ist, dass es nicht überlebt, wenn es eine makrodurchschnittliche Grenze nimmt, wenn die kausale Raum-Zeit-Struktur von Einsteins allgemeiner Relativität wiederhergestellt wird. Dieses zusätzliche Feld wäre ein Ort für "Gedankenformen" und unsere Theorie würde diese Gedankenformen mit mehr "physischen" Realitätsebenen koppeln.<br/>"Zeit" würde nur in einer bestimmten begrenzenden Struktur entstehen. Nichts hindert eine Theorie eines solchen Typs daran, mathematische Strukturen zu haben, die reich genug sind, um Bewusstsein und Geist zu akkommodieren. Aufgrund seiner Komplexität, Dichte von Zeitschleifen, blasenartige kausale Struktur, Vorhersagen in einer solchen Theorie ist nur durch die Anwendung von Wahrscheinlichkeit möglich -<br/>wie es bei Systemen der Fall ist, die sich nach deterministischer, aber chaotischer Dynamik entwickeln. Quantenwellenfunktion würde in einer solchen Theorie als eine effektive Art der Vorhersage auftauchen. Diese Art der Erklärung des Quantenindeterminismus wurde vor langer Zeit von I. J. Good postuliert.<br/>[3] er spekuliert, dass Quantenindeterminismus verstanden werden kann, wenn wir zugeben, dass einzelne Quantenereignisse, die tatsächlich hier und jetzt auftreten, auch in Zukunft fortgeschrittene Ursachen haben, in der Vergangenheit verzögerte Ursachen haben.<br/>Ein Blick auf einen solchen Gedanken mag Alan Turing aufgefallen sein, als er seinen berühmten, bereits zitierten Satz schrieb: "Vorhersage muss linear sein, Beschreibung muss nichtlinear sein."<br/>Eine Theorie, die teilweise in diese Richtung geht, wird von L. Nottale entwickelt.<br/>[43] Wer stellt die Beobachtung, zugeschrieben Feynman, dass "die typischen Pfade der quantenmechanischen Teilchen sind kontinuierlich nicht differenzierbar." Dann setzt er seine Entwicklung fraktaler Raum-Zeit-Ideen fort, um zu schließen: "Das Quantenverhalten wird in dieser Theorie zu einer Manifestation der fraktalen Geometrie der Raum-Zeit, ebenso ist die Gravitation in Einsteins Theorie der allgemeinen (Bewegungs-)Relativität eine Manifestation der Krümmung der Raum-Zeit.<br/>Ein weiterer Schritt in diese Richtung kommt von der Arbeit russischer Wissenschaftler - die mit den originellsten Ideen von N.A. Kozyrev begann [44]<br/>und A. Sacharow [45], und wird in Moskau, dem Ural und Sibirien entwickelt, siehe z.B. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Beste Ernährung und Bewegung zum Abnehmen<br/><br/>Wie ist das Frühstück wirklich gesund?<br/><br/>Am Morgen wie ein Kaiser, am Mittag wie ein König, am Abend wie ein Bettler – lautet ein bekanntes Sprichwort. Eine Studie der medizinischen Organisation Endocrine Society bestätigt die Kernaussage des Sprichworts: Es zeigt, dass das Frühstück eine wichtigere Rolle spielt, als oft angenommen wird. Am Morgen hat der menschliche Körper tatsächlich mehr als doppelt so viel metabolische Aktivität wie zu anderen Tageszeiten: Ein großes Frühstück hält Sie nicht nur lange satt, auch der Blutzucker- und Insulinspiegel steigen langsam an. Der Appetit auf Süßigkeiten ist reguliert, wir essen weniger Snacks während des Tages. Daher sollte das Frühstück auch während einer Diät nicht übersprungen werden.<br/><br/>Natürlich bedeutet ein großes Frühstück nicht, dass wir am Morgen mehrere Croissants mit Nuss-Nougat-Creme und süßen Frühstückspfannkuchen haben sollten. Das Frühstück ist am besten gesund, wenn es reich an Proteinen und Ballaststoffen ist und Vitamine und Mineralien liefert. Vollkornbrot oder Müsli, Haferflocken, Früchte und Nüsse sind Energielieferanten, die gut für Sie sind und Sie lange satt halten.<br/><br/>Die Tatsache, dass ein großes Frühstück besser ist als ein großes Abendessen, bedeutet nicht unbedingt, dass das Frühstück wichtig ist, um Gewicht zu verlieren. Eine Meta-Analyse aus dem Jahr 2019 ergab, dass die tägliche Gesamtenergieaufnahme von Menschen, die frühstücken, im Durchschnitt höher ist als die von Menschen, die kein Frühstück frühstücken. Letztere waren im Durchschnitt knapp ein halbes Kilo leichter. Nach den Ergebnissen dieser großen Studie müssen Sie also nicht unbedingt frühstücken, wenn Sie abnehmen möchten.<br/><br/>Abnehmen mit der richtigen Diät – so einfach ist es, gesund auf den Teller zu legen<br/><br/>Gesund essen heißt keineswegs weniger Geschmack: Frisches Gemüse, Fisch oder Fleisch als Eiweißquelle und andere gesunde Zutaten zaubern Geschmack im Topf und ein Lächeln auf die Lippen – idealerweise auch beim Schritt auf die Waage. Eine US-Studie hat gezeigt, dass Menschen, die ihr eigenes Essen kochen und bewusst mit dem umgehen, was sie essen, einen Body-Mass-Index im normalen Bereich haben. Restaurantbesuche oder Fastfood hingegen locken schnell in die Zuckerfalle: Oftmals gibt es keinen Hinweis darauf, wie viel Zucker in Salatdressings steckt, wie viel Fett die Kartoffeln eingebraten wurden oder ob das Fleisch nicht behandelt wurde.<br/><br/>Ein gesundes Mittagessen besteht aus drei Teilen - der größte Teil ist Obst oder Gemüse und sollte die Hälfte des Tellers bedecken. Ein Viertel der Mahlzeit sollte aus Protein bestehen, d. H. Fisch, Fleisch oder Tofu. Das restliche Viertel besteht aus Kohlenhydraten und wird idealerweise aus Vollkornprodukten hergestellt. Wichtig: Essen Sie nicht am Schreibtisch im Büro, sondern stimulieren Sie Ihren Stoffwechsel und machen Sie idealerweise einen kurzen Spaziergang vor oder nach dem Mittagessen.<br/><br/>Wann sollten Sie essen, um Gewicht zu verlieren?<br/><br/>Am Abend sollten Sie sich auf leichte Mahlzeiten konzentrieren, die eher kohlenhydratarm sind. Diese verursachen am wenigsten Insulin in die Höhe, was unserem Körper gut tut. Gemüse, Milchprodukte und Nüsse sind beispielsweise dafür gut geeignet.<br/><br/>Sie sollten auch darauf achten, nicht zu spät zu Abend zu essen. Es ist am besten, bis 19 Uhr gegessen zu haben – dann kann sich der Körper entspannen und sich auf die Nacht vorbereiten. Ausreichend Schlaf ist wichtig für eine gesunde Gewichtsabnahme. Eine US-Studie ergab, dass Menschen, die etwa acht Stunden pro Nacht schliefen, bessere Fettablagerungen hatten. Gute Nacht! Gönnen Sie sich mehr als sechs Stunden Schlaf, damit Sie den nächsten Tag fit und erfrischt beginnen können.<br/><br/>Abnehmen ohne Sport – ist das wirklich möglich?<br/><br/>Es wäre so einfach, wenn das Traumgewicht einfach durch die Senkung der Kalorienzufuhr erreicht werden könnte. Aber Sie wissen wahrscheinlich, dass Diät nur eine Seite der Medaille ist und Bewegung die andere. So hilft nichts: Ziehen Sie Ihre Sportbekleidung an und los geht's!<br/><br/>Wer neben dem Sportprogramm wie Joggen, Spazierengehen oder Schwimmen auch den Aufzug alleine gehen lässt und die Treppe nimmt, einen kleinen Umweg macht oder das Fahrrad anstelle des Autos benutzt, der tut es gutwird auch etwas Gutes genannt. Auch einfaches Gehen ist gut für die Gesundheit. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Warum wir den Anvil App Server geöffnet haben<br/><br/>Warum Open Source?<br/><br/>Vor einiger Zeit haben wir den Anvil App Server geöffnet. Die Reaktion der Community war großartig, sogar ein wenig überwältigend (ja, jede Antwort auf diese Ankündigung ist wirklich in meinem Posteingang gelandet!). Wir haben bereits eine Reihe dieses Feedbacks in unsere Version 1.2 integriert. Aber wir werden immer wieder gefragt: "Warum haben Sie einen solchen Kernteil Ihres Produkts geöffnet? "<br/><br/>Warum tun Sie das überhaupt?<br/><br/>Anvil ist ein Tool, das es so einfach wie möglich macht, eine Web-App zu erstellen. Wir tun dies, indem wir es Ihnen ermöglichen, die gesamte Anwendung in einer Sprache, Python, zu erstellen.<br/><br/>Einfaches Hosting ist ein Teil davon.<br/><br/>Die Web-Plattform ist kaputt, und Anvil ist unser Versuch, es zu beheben. Und weil es so viel Komplexität bei der Bereitstellung einer Web-App gibt, war ein Cloud-gehosteter Service der beste Weg, um die Einfachheit zu bieten, die wir wollen. Auf diese Weise können Sie Ihre App im Anvil Editor erstellen und mit einem Klick im Internet verfügbar machen.<br/><br/>Aber wir hörten immer wieder von Leuten, die sagten: "Das ist großartig, aber..."<br/><br/>"...aber ich muss dies auf einer Offshore-Plattform ohne zuverlässigen Internetzugang laufen lassen"<br/><br/>"...aber ich möchte meine App in ein IoT-Gerät verpacken, das ich verkaufe"<br/><br/>oder einfach, "...aber wenn ich meine Eier in diesen Korb lege, wie kann ich sicher sein, dass ich meine App in zehn Jahren noch laufen lassen kann?"<br/><br/>Das sind alles gute Punkte! Ein Cloud-Service ist nicht für jeden die richtige Lösung. Wenn wir diese Benutzer bedienen wollen, muss es einen Weg für sie geben, ihre Apps aus Anvil herauszuholen und sie lokal unter ihrer eigenen Kontrolle zu betreiben.<br/><br/>Open Source: Fluchtluke, kein Auswerfersitz<br/><br/>Wir glauben an Fluchtluken, nicht an Auswerfersitze. Auf Konferenzen werden wir manchmal gefragt: "Kann ich dies als Flask + JS-App exportieren?". Sicher, es wäre möglich – wir könnten ein Serverpaket generieren, die clientseitige Python nach Javascript kompilieren und eine klassische Web-App ausspucken. Aber es hätte schwerwiegende Nachteile, denn:<br/><br/>Keine bequeme Fahrt.<br/><br/>Codegenerierung ist ein Auswerfersitz. Generierter Code ist besser als nichts – zumindest können Sie ihn bearbeiten! Aber sobald Sie diesen Code bearbeiten, verlieren Sie alle Vorteile des Systems, das ihn generiert hat. Wenn Sie Anvil wegen seines Drag-and-Drop-Editors und Python im Browser verwenden, warum sollten unsere lokal gehosteten Benutzer Vim und Javascript verwenden?<br/><br/>Also haben wir es richtig gemacht: Wir haben die Laufzeit-Engine von Anvil geöffnet. Es ist derselbe Code, der Ihrer App in unserem gehosteten Dienst dient, und er repräsentiert Ihre App auf die gleiche Weise. Sie können Ihren Code mit einem Texteditor bearbeiten, ausführen und dann in unsere Online-IDE zurückschieben. Es ist kein Auswerfersitz: Es gibt keinen explosiven Übergang. Es ist eine Fluchtluke: Sie können herausklettern und direkt wieder hineinklettern.<br/><br/>Was ist mit unserem Geschäftsmodell?<br/><br/>Anvil war nie dazu gedacht, eines dieser Low-Code-Systeme für Unternehmen zu sein, die Ihnen 20 US-Dollar pro Monat für jede Person berechnen, die Ihre App verwendet. Anvil ist ein Entwicklertool. Die von Ihnen entwickelten Apps gehören Ihnen. Es ist cool, sie auf einem Raspberry Pi laufen zu lassen, aber es ändert nichts an unserem Geschäftsmodell.<br/><br/>Wir machen das, was wir schon immer waren: Wir entwickeln und verkaufen ein Entwicklungstool, das das Erstellen von Webanwendungen drastisch vereinfacht. Wir bieten Hosting für Anvil-Apps. Wir bieten die gesamte Entwicklungs- und Hosting-Plattform vor Ort für Unternehmenskunden. Und natürlich bieten wir einen kostenlosen Plan an, damit jeder Anvil für Hobby- oder Bildungszwecke nutzen kann - oder um etwas zu bauen und zu sehen, wie es läuft.<br/><br/>Wir haben den Anvil App Server für die (relativ kleine) Anzahl von Personen, die ihn benötigen, geöffnet und die ultimative Versicherungspolice zur Verfügung gestellt. Sicher, Sie können eine App mit vim erstellen und selbst hosten, ohne auch nur ein Konto bei uns zu registrieren (wir haben Dokumente, die Ihnen zeigen, wie!). Aber der Anvil Editor ist der weltweit einfachste Weg, eine Web-App zu erstellen, und unser gehosteter Service ist der einfachste Weg, sie bereitzustellen – das erwarten wir von den meisten unserer Nutzer auch weiterhin. Und Sie können mit Zuversicht bauen, da Sie wissen, dass der Open-Source-Code genau dort ist, wenn Sie ihn brauchen.<br/><br/>Probieren Sie es selbst aus<br/><br/>Wenn unsere Entwicklungsphilosophie bei Ihnen ankommt, warum probieren Sie Anvil nicht selbst aus? |
