| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Durch die Bibel C2000 SerieSollen wir uns dem Buch der Apostelgeschichte, Kapitel eins, zuwenden, während wir unser Studium der frühen Kirche beginnen.<br/>Luke, der Autor der Apostelgeschichte, ein Begleiter von Paulus dem Apostel, der auch Autor des Evangeliums nach Lukas war, schrieb diese beiden Abhandlungen an einen Freund, Theophilus. Theophilus ist ein griechischer Name. Es ist ein Name, der eine schöne Bedeutung hat. Der Name bedeutet Liebhaber Gottes. Es gibt einige, die glauben, dass es überhaupt kein Mensch war, sondern dass das Evangelium und das Buch der Apostelgeschichte an die Liebhaber Gottes gerichtet waren, wer auch immer du sein magst. Es gibt andere Traditionen, die sagen, dass Theophilus tatsächlich Lukes Meister war. Dass in jenen Tagen Ärzte Sklaven waren, in der Regel der Sklave eines wohlhabenden Gönners. So dass Lukes Meister Theophilus war, und er Luke freigab, um mit Paulus auf den Missionsreisen zu sein. So schreibt Luke zurück zu seinem ehemaligen Meister. Dies ist eine frühe Tradition der Kirche, aber es ist natürlich unmöglich zu beweisen, wie so viele der Traditionen.<br/>Es gibt auch diejenigen, die glauben, dass, als Paulus in Troas war und er eine Vision von einem Mann erhielt, der zu ihm rief und sagte: "Komm nach Mazedonien und hilf uns", dass dieser Mann in Pauls Vision kein anderer als Lukas war. Der erste, den Paulus wirklich traf, als er nach Mazedonien kam, war Lukas. Und wie wir in der Apostelgeschichte sind, werden Sie feststellen, dass Lukas, wenn wir zu diesem Teil der Apostelgeschichte kommen, beginnt, mehr in der ersten als in der dritten Person zu schreiben. So ist es offensichtlich, an diesem bestimmten Punkt in der Apostelgeschichte, dass Lukas wurde ein Begleiter von Paulus und begann mit ihm zu reisen.Er begann, die Pronomen "wir" und "uns" anstelle von "sie" und "sie" zu verwenden. Dies ist zweifellos der Ort, an dem Lukas ein Teilnehmer und ein Augenzeuge jener Dinge wurde, die von diesem Punkt an geschahen. Wir werden euch dies mitteilen, wenn wir zu diesem Punkt kommen.<br/>Er beginnt die Apostelgeschichte, indem er sie mit dem Evangelium nach Lukas verbindet. Es ist interessant, dass das allerletzte, was Lukas in seinem Evangelium aufzeichnet, das allererste ist, was er in der Apostelgeschichte aufzeichnet. Das Lukasevangelium schließt sich, als Jesus seinen Jüngern sagt, dass sie in Jerusalem warten sollen, bis sie mit Kraft aus der Höhe ausgestattet sind. Und dann ist Jesus in den Himmel aufgefahren, und so schließt er das Evangelium. Als er die Apostelgeschichte öffnet, schreibt er:<br/>Die frühere Abhandlung [das heißt, das Evangelium nach Lukas] habe ich euch geschrieben, o Theophilus, von allem, was Jesus zu tun und zu lehren begann (Apg 1,1),<br/>Das Schlüsselwort beginnt. Das Evangelium nach Lukas ist nicht die ganze Geschichte des Dienstes Jesu Christi. Es ist nur der Anfang des Dienstes Jesu Christi. Jesus dient weiterhin den Bedürfnissen der Menschen. Jesus heilt weiterhin die Kranken. Jesus erweckt weiterhin die Toten. Jesus dient weiterhin der Welt Seine Liebe und Sein Evangelium. Erst jetzt dient Er durch jene Jünger, die mit Seinem Heiligen Geist gesalbt wurden. Aber der Dienst Christi geht weiter; im Grunde genommen ist dies die Voraussetzung, die Lukas in die Apostelgeschichte aufnimmt. Die frühere Abhandlung über alles, was Jesus begann, sowohl zu tun als auch zu lehren.<br/>Aus diesem Grund ist die Apostelgeschichte ein unvollendetes Buch, in dem der Herr heute weiterhin durch das Leben derer wirkt, die sich als Werkzeuge Gottes hingegeben haben. Von Seinem Heiligen Geist geführt und geführt und gesalbt zu werden, um den Dienst Jesu in der heutigen Welt fortzusetzen. Jetzt hat Gott angeordnet, dass Sein Werk durch menschliche Werkzeuge vollbracht werden soll. Ich sage nicht, dass es vollbracht werden muss. Gott kann Engelwesen für Sein Werk gebrauchen, und es wird eine Zeit kommen, in der Gott während der Offenbarung Engel benutzen wird, um Sein Evangelium den Menschen auf der ganzen Welt zu verkünden. Offenbarung, Kapitel 14, „Der erste Engel, der durch die Mitte des Himmels fliegt und das ewige Evangelium hat“ (Offenbarung 14:6). Aber in der heutigen Zeit hat Gott sich entschieden, menschliche Werkzeuge zu benutzen. So unvollkommen sie auch sein mögen, doch das ist es, was Gott verordnet hat. Das Spannende daran ist, Gott wird mich gebrauchen und Gott wird dich gebrauchen. So oft betteln wir ab: "O Herr, ich kann nicht sprechen. Ich konnte noch nie sprechen, Herr." Als Moses versuchte, den Ruf Gottes abzubitten. Jeremia sagte: „Herr, ich bin nur ein Kind; niemand wird mir zuhören.“ Und wir alle haben unsere Entschuldigungen, warum wir nicht gebraucht werden können. Nicht wahr? Wir alle kennen die Gründe, warum Gott uns nicht gebrauchen konnte.<br/>Einmal, als der Herr einen Propheten zu seinem Werk rief, sagte er: „Herr, sende, wen du willst.“ Der Herr sagte: „Hey, ich habe dich gerufen.“ „Herr, gute Idee, sende, wen du willst.“ So oft sind wir in dieser Position: „Herr, sende durch die Hand von wem du willst, jeder außer mir Herr.“ Und doch hat Gott uns dazu bestimmt, uns zu benutzen.<br/>Jetzt kann jeder von uns seine eigenen Unvollkommenheiten zeigen. Jeder von uns kann auf seine eigenen Unfähigkeiten hinweisen, und wir alle können eine Entschuldigung finden, warum Gott mich nicht benutzen möchte. Aber Gott hat sich entschieden, dich zu benutzen. Dass er sich durch dein Leben einer bedürftigen Welt offenbaren könnte. Du fragst dich, wann Gott solche Werkzeuge hat, um zu benutzen, wie Er jemals die Arbeit erledigt hat, nicht wahr?<br/>Bis zu dem Tag, an dem er aufgenommen wurde, nachdem er durch den Heiligen Geist den Aposteln, die er erwählt hatte, Gebote gegeben hatte (Apg 1,2):<br/>Damit beendete er das Lukasevangelium: An dem Tag, an dem Jesus aufgenommen wurde, nachdem er den Aposteln gesagt hatte, sie sollten auf die Gabe der Macht warten.<br/>Dem er sich auch nach seinem Leiden durch viele unfehlbare Beweise lebendig zeigte (Apg 1,3).<br/>Es ist schwierig, die Tatsache der Auferstehung Jesu Christi zu leugnen. Ich war amüsiert, sowie verärgert und irritiert, durch einen Artikel, den ich am vergangenen Samstag im Santa Ana Register gelesen habe. Von den Schöpfungswissenschafts- und Evolutionstheorien, die in den County-Schulen präsentiert werden. Wie das, dieser Professor sagte, dass er eine Wissenschaftsklasse unterrichtet, und so handeln sie nur in Fakten, und dass sie keinen Platz für Theorien haben. Weil die Wissenschaft auf Fakten basiert und die Schöpfung auf religiösem Aberglauben basiert. Es braucht viel Glauben, um den religiösen Theorien zu glauben. Wenn man es mit Fakten zu tun hat, kann man sie einfach akzeptieren. Ich dachte: "Sehr interessant in diesem Wissenschaftskurs, sie lehrten mich, dass die Welt vier Milliarden Jahre alt war. Jetzt lehren sie, dass die Welt zwölf Milliarden Jahre alt ist. Und es ist noch gar nicht so lange her, dass ich zur Schule gegangen bin."<br/>Es ist interessant, dass die Bibel nie überarbeitet oder aktualisiert werden musste, um den aktuellen Daten zu entsprechen, die Männer entdeckt haben. Und doch, wenn Sie heute meine Highschool-Lehrbücher nehmen und versuchen würden, einen Wissenschaftskurs von ihnen zu unterrichten, würden Sie feststellen, dass viele der Dinge, die als wissenschaftliche Tatsache gelehrt wurden, als ich in der Highschool war, nicht mehr als wissenschaftliche Tatsache anerkannt werden. Das einfache Zell-Protoplasma ist nicht mehr eine einfache Zelle, sondern äußerst komplex. Wenn es irgendeine Tatsache gibt, die in der Geschichte bezeugt werden kann, ist es die Tatsache der Auferstehung Jesu Christi von den Toten.<br/>Wir haben ein Rechtssystem, das auf Zeugenaussagen basiert. Wenn ein Mann eines Verbrechens beschuldigt wird und es Menschen gibt, die dieses Verbrechen bezeugt haben, während es begangen wurde, und sie werden zum Standard gebracht, und sie schwören, die Wahrheit, die ganze Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit zu sagen, so hilf ihnen Gott. Und als sie fragten, sagten sie: "Ich sah den Mann in der Bank am 23. Mai. Ich sah ihn eine Pistole aus seinem Mantel ziehen. Ich hörte, wie er verlangte, dass ihm das ganze Geld gegeben werde. Ich sah ihn, als er die Bank verließ. Ich sah ihn, wie der Beamte ihn draußen festnahm.“ Und wenn du drei oder vier Zeugen dazu bringen kannst, auf diesen Mann zu zeigen und ihr Zeugnis unter Kreuzverhör zu halten, wird dieser Mann für schuldig befunden. Er ist es, der es getan hat. Wir haben zwei oder drei Zeugen, die die gleiche Geschichte über diesen Mann bezeugen, und es wird als Tatsache akzeptiert, dass er derjenige ist, der das Verbrechen begangen hat und schuldig ist.<br/>Nach dem Tode Jesu, als er wieder auferstand, erschien er vielen verschiedenen Leuten, die geschworen hatten, daß sie ihn sahen, daß sie mit ihm redeten, daß er ihnen unter verschiedenen Umständen an verschiedenen Orten erschien. Und vierzig Tage lang war er bei ihnen. Und auf einmal, bis zu fünfhundert Menschen, die an einem Ort versammelt waren, erschien Er. Es ist schwierig, das Zeugnis dieser Leute einfach beiseite zu werfen oder zu leugnen. Dies zu tun bedeutet, unser gesamtes Rechtssystem zu diskreditieren. Aber nicht nur das, diese Männer, die bezeugten, dass sie den auferstandenen Herrn sahen, dass sie mit Ihm sprachen, dass sie mit Ihm aßen, sie alle, mit Ausnahme eines, trafen gewaltsame Todesfälle durch die Hände anderer Menschen, weil sie behaupteten, dass die Geschichte, die sie erzählten, wahr sei. Sie sprechen von Zeugen, die geschworen haben, die Wahrheit zu sagen, die ganze Wahrheit, nichts als die Wahrheit. Wenn das Leben eines Menschen wegen dieses Zeugen bedroht wäre, und es war eine Lüge, hätte mindestens einer von ihnen unter dem Druck gebrochen. Sie hätten den ganzen Schwindel gestanden. "Er zeigte sich nach seiner Leidenschaft durch viele unfehlbare Beweise lebendig."<br/>40 Tage lang von ihnen gesehen zu werden und ihnen von den Dingen zu erzählen, die das Reich Gottes betreffen (Apg 1,3):<br/>Manchmal beschuldigen wir die Jünger wegen ihrer Fragen über den Zeitpunkt des Reiches Gottes. Lasst uns daran erinnern, dass das Reich Gottes das Lieblingsthema Jesu Christi war. Er hat immer über das Reich Gottes gesprochen, und es ist eine große Hoffnung, dass Er in die Herzen aller Menschen gepflanzt hat. Die Dinge werden nicht immer so verdorben bleiben, wie sie sind. Die Welt wird nicht für immer unter der Macht der Finsternis, unter der Knechtschaft des Bösen gehen. Gott wird eines Tages sein Reich auf Erden errichten. Ein Reich der gerechten Freude und des Friedens. "Jesus wird herrschen, ehe die Sonne aufeinanderfolgende Reisen unternimmt, und sein Reich wird sich von Land zu Land erstrecken." Und dieser Tag wird der herrlichste Tag sein, den die Welt je gesehen hat, wie Krankheit und Leid und Schmerz in Seinem Reich abgeschafft werden, wie Sünde und Gier und diese Dinge, die die Welt zu einem so unerträglichen Ort gemacht haben, in Seinem Reich abgeschafft werden. Der gottlose Kommerzialismus, die Ausbeutung des Menschen, all diese Dinge wurden in Seinem glorreichen Königreich abgeschafft, als Er regierte. Kein Wunder, dass die Jünger bestrebt waren, es weiterzuführen. Ich bin bestrebt, es weiterzuführen; Ich bin bestrebt, dass Sein Königreich kommt. Und Jesus sagte uns, wenn wir beten, ist die erste Bitte: „Dein Reich komme, dein Wille geschehe auf Erden, wie es im Himmel ist“ (Mt 6,10). Das ist das rechte Verlangen, das wir alle haben sollten. Ich wünsche das Reich Gottes. Und so redete er zu ihnen während dieser vierzigtägigen Zeit vom Königreich.<br/>Und als er sich mit ihnen versammelt hatte, befahl er ihnen, daß sie nicht von Jerusalem weggehen sollten, sondern auf die Verheißung des Vaters warten sollten, die ihr, spricht er, von mir gehört habt (Apg 1,4).<br/>Und er sprach: Siehe, warte hier in Jerusalem, bis du die Verheißung des Vaters empfangen hast. Diese Verheißung, auf die er sich bezieht, ist zweifellos die Verheißung in Joel, wo der Herr verheißen hat: „Und es wird geschehen in den späteren Tagen, spricht der Herr, dass ich meinen Geist auf alles Fleisch ausgießen werde; und deine Söhne und Töchter werden weissagen, und deine Jünglinge werden Träume träumen, deine Alten werden Visionen sehen; und auf meine Knechte und meine Mägde werde ich meinen Geist ausgießen, spricht der Herr“ (Joes 2,28-29). Die Verheißung des Vaters: Der Tag wird kommen, an dem Gott seinen Geist ausgießen wird über alles Fleisch, über alle Gläubigen, und sie werden, jeder von ihnen, diese Dynamik von Gott empfangen.<br/>Denn Johannes hat wahrhaftig mit Wasser getauft; aber ihr werdet in nicht vielen Tagen mit dem Heiligen Geist getauft werden (Apg 1,5).<br/>Die Idee der Taufe war die des Auftauchens, des Taufedzo. Johannes taufte mit Wasser, tauchte die Menschen in Wasser. „Du wirst in nicht vielen Tagen im Heiligen Geist untergetaucht sein.“<br/>Als sie nun zusammengekommen waren, fragten sie ihn und sprachen: Herr, willst du in dieser Zeit das Königreich an Israel zurückgeben?<br/>„Wann wird es sein, Herr? Wann ist die Zeit für diese Wiederherstellung?“ Und Jesus spricht jetzt zu ihnen, nicht über das Königreich, sondern über die Macht, die sie für den Dienst empfangen werden. Und so streicht er ihre Frage beiseite.<br/>und sprach zu ihnen: Es steht euch nicht zu, die Zeiten und die Zeiten zu kennen, die der Vater in seine eigene Macht gesetzt hat (Apg 1,7).<br/>„Es steht euch nicht zu, es zu wissen.“ Sie lebten ständig in der Erwartung der sofortigen Errichtung des Königreichs. Während des gesamten Lebens Jesu erwarteten sie, dass er jeden Moment in die Telefonzelle gehen und als Retter der Welt herauskommen würde. Shazzam! Seine Macht zu zeigen und die Regierungen der Welt zu stürzen, Gottes Königreich auf der Erde zu errichten. Und sie warteten täglich darauf, dass sich diese Veränderung ereignete. Und wann immer Jesus davon redete, nach Jerusalem zu gehen, in die Hände eines sündigen Menschen gegeben zu werden und dann gekreuzigt zu werden: "Oh, oh nein, Herr. Nein, du verstehst das Königreich nicht, Herr. Sei so weit von dir entfernt." Als Jesus am Kreuz starb, waren sie alle sehr enttäuscht.<br/>Die beiden Jünger auf dem Weg nach Emmaus, so traurig. „Hey, Leute. Wie kommt es, dass ihr so traurig seid, als würdet ihr entlanggehen?“ „Was meinst du damit? Du musst hier ein Fremder sein, wenn du nicht weißt, was in letzter Zeit in Jerusalem passiert ist.“ „Was für Dinge?“ "Oh, ein Mann mit dem Namen Jesus von Nazareth...oh Mann, es war mächtig und mächtig. Die Salbung Gottes war auf seinem Leben. Wir hatten gehofft, dass in ihm die Befreiung Israels war, aber sie kreuzigten ihn. Wir hatten gehofft . . . jetzt ist es tot." Nun ist Er auferstanden, und Er sagt: „In ein paar Tagen, Leute, werdet ihr die Verheißung des Vaters empfangen.“ „Oh, welche Verheißung? Die Verheißung der Errichtung des Reiches?“ Ihr seht, es war legitim, dass sie fragen sollten. „Ist das Herr? Ist dies die Zeit? Werdet ihr jetzt euer Königreich aufrichten?« »Nein. Es ist nicht eure Sache, jene Zeiten zu kennen, die der Vater bestimmt hat oder die der Vater in seiner eigenen Macht hat. Aber ihr werdet Kraft empfangen, wenn der Heilige Geist über euch gekommen ist.«<br/>Nun, hier wird die griechische Präposition epi verwendet, um eine neue Beziehung zu bezeichnen, die sie mit dem Heiligen Geist haben sollten. Im Johannesevangelium, Kapitel 14, als Jesus dort verspricht, den Heiligen Geist zu senden, sagte er: „Ich werde euch nicht ohne Trost zurücklassen. Ich werde zu euch kommen, und ich werde den Vater bitten, und er wird euch einen anderen Tröster senden, nämlich den Geist der Wahrheit, den die Welt nicht empfangen kann, weil sie ihn nicht sieht, noch ihn kennt, sondern ihr kennt ihn, denn er wohnt bei euch, und er wird in euch sein“ (Joh 14,17-18). Die gleiche griechische Präposition wie unsere, nur buchstabieren sie es "en" statt "in". Zweifache Beziehung dort in Johannes: Er ist mit dir, aber er wird in dir wohnen. Aber jetzt sagte Jesus, du wirst Kraft empfangen, wenn der Heilige Geist über dich kommt. Die griechische Präposition epi, die in verschiedenen Texten im gesamten Neuen Testament als "auf" oder "über" oder ich mag es, "überfließt" übersetzt wird.<br/>Im siebten Kapitel des Johannesevangeliums heißt es: „Am letzten Tag, dem großen Tag des Festes, als Jesus dort auf dem Tempelberg stand und zum Volk rief: ‚Wenn jemand Durst hat, soll er zu mir kommen und trinken. Johannes aber sprach: Das hat er geredet von dem Geist, der noch nicht gegeben ist, den die an ihn Glaubenden empfangen sollen“ (Joh 7,37-39). Was hat er von dem Geist geredet, daß es wie ein Strom lebendigen Wassers wäre, der herausfließt. Ich mag: "Wenn der Geist über euch überströmt", über euch oder über euch oder über euch. Also die dreifache Beziehung: Er ist vor eurer Bekehrung mit euch, Er ist derjenige, der euch erkennen lässt, dass ihr ein Sünder seid, Er ist derjenige, der auf Jesus Christus als die Antwort zeigt, wie Er die Welt von Sünde, von Rechtschaffenheit und vom Gericht überzeugt. In dem Moment, in dem du dein Leben und dein Herz Jesus Christus öffnest und ihn einlädst, hereinzukommen, kommt der Heilige Geist und beginnt, dir innezuwohnen. Wisset ihr nicht, daß ihr nicht euer eigen seid, so seid ihr um einen Preis erkauft worden; darum verherrlicht Gott in eurem Leibe und in eurem Geiste, der sein ist. Und wisset ihr nicht, daß euer Leib der Tempel des Heiligen Geistes ist, der in euch ist? Seid nicht betrunken vom Wein, in dem Überfluss ist, sondern werdet erfüllt, oder ihr werdet erfüllt mit dem Geist“ (1Kor 6,19-20; Eph 5,18). Aber jetzt ist hier eine dritte Beziehung. Dies ist eine ermächtigende Erfahrung.<br/>Ihr werdet die Dynamik empfangen, wenn der Heilige Geist über euch gekommen ist; und ihr werdet mir Zeugen sein.<br/>Und so ist die Dynamik, ein Zeuge für Jesus Christus zu sein. Es ist interessant, dass das Wort Zeugnis im Griechischen das Wort Martus ist, von wo wir unser Wort Märtyrer bekommen. Und im Griechischen bedeutet es Märtyrer. Ein Zeuge ist jemand, der nicht nur verkündet, was er glaubt, er lebt, was er glaubt, er ist, was er glaubt, und er glaubt es so stark, dass er, wenn nötig, für das sterben wird, was er glaubt. So stark ist sein Glaube. Er ist ein Martus. Er hat keine Angst, für das zu sterben, was er glaubt.<br/>Sie erinnern sich, als Paulus auf dem Weg zurück nach Jerusalem war und Agabus von Cäsarea herunterkam, und er nahm den Gürtel des Paulus und band sich zusammen und sagte: "So ist der Mann, dem dieser Gürtel gehört, gebunden zu sein, wenn er nach Jerusalem kommt." Und Pauls Freunde fingen an zu weinen und sagten: "Oh, Paul, geh nicht, geh nicht." Und er sagte: "Was meinst du mit diesen Tränen? Glaubst du, du wirst mich abschrecken? Glaubst du, ich mache mir Sorgen, gebunden zu sein? Ich bin bereit zu sterben." Er war ein Martus. "Ich bin bereit zu sterben." Für deinen Glauben getötet zu werden, hat dich nicht zum Märtyrer gemacht; weil du ein Märtyrer warst, wurdest du getötet. Weil du ein Zeuge warst, weil du es so stark geglaubt hast. Es hat dich also nicht zu einem Zeugen gemacht, es hat nur bewiesen, was du warst. Du warst die ganze Zeit ein Zeuge. Wenn du kein Martus gewesen wärst, wärst du nie in den Tod gegangen. Du hättest gekündigt; du hättest gesagt: "Whoa, whoa, warte, warte. Ich glaube, ich habe einen Fehler gemacht." Dann sagst du: "Nun, er war kein Martus. Ein Pferd zu stehlen macht dich nicht zum Pferdedieb; es beweist nur, dass du es warst. Niemand stiehlt ein Pferd, es sei denn, er ist ein Pferdedieb. Das Stehlen macht dich also nicht zum Pferdedieb, es beweist nur, dass du die ganze Zeit warst. Märtyrer zu sein beweist nur, was du ein Zeuge warst, ein Martus. „Und du wirst Zeugen sein.“ Und ist es nicht interessant, dass die meisten von ihnen gemartert wurden? „Zeugen zu Mir.“<br/>Der Zeuge sollte sowohl in Jerusalem als auch in ganz Judäa sein (Apg 1,8),<br/>Der Zeuge begann direkt zu Hause. Der schwierigste Ort, nicht wahr? Es ist, direkt zu Hause in Jerusalem zu beginnen, und dann die Gegend um Jerusalem, das Gebiet von Judäa. Und dann sollte es sich in Samaria ausbreiten. Und dann ging es hinaus in die äußersten Teile der Welt. Und wenn wir das Buch der Apostelgeschichte studieren, werden wir genau diesen Fortschritt sehen. Wie das Zeugnis in Jerusalem begann. Das werden wir im nächsten Kapitel erfahren. Und dann werden wir sehen, wie es sich in Judäa auszubreiten begann. Und dann ging Philipp nach Samaria hinauf, und schließlich sind Paulus und Barnabas aufgerufen, in die äußersten Teile der Welt zu gehen. Und so verbreitete sich das Zeugnis durch die Salbung und die Ermächtigung des Heiligen Geistes.<br/>Und als er dies gesagt hatte, während sie zusahen, wurde er emporgehoben; und eine Wolke nahm ihn auf von ihren Augen (Apg 1,9).<br/>Dies ist die letzte Verheißung, die Jesus Seinen Jüngern gegeben hat. Dies ist die letzte Rede vor Seiner Himmelfahrt. Natürlich kam Er später und sprach mit Paulus und anderen, aber vor Seiner Himmelfahrt ist dies Sein letztes Wort. Und als er dies gesagt hatte, während sie ihn beobachteten, wurde er emporgehoben, und eine Wolke nahm ihn von ihren Augen auf.<br/>Und während sie standhaft zum Himmel schauten, als er hinaufging, siehe, da waren zwei Männer, die in weißer Kleidung bei ihnen standen (Apg 1,10).<br/>Wir gehen davon aus, dass es Engel waren.<br/>Und er sprach: Ihr Männer von Galiläa, warum steht ihr auf und schaut in den Himmel? Dieser Jesus, der von euch in den Himmel aufgenommen ist, wird so kommen, wie ihr ihn in den Himmel kommen gesehen habt (Apg 1,11).<br/>Sie sahen ihn, als er in den Himmel auffuhr, und sie werden ihn sehen, wenn er wiederkommt. „Siehe, der Herr kommt mit zehntausenden seiner Heiligen, um Gericht zu halten auf Erden“ (Jud 1,14-15). Und dann: „Dem, der uns geliebt und sich selbst für uns hingegeben hat und der uns zu unserem Gott gemacht hat, zu Königen und Priestern, die mit ihm auf der Erde regieren werden, siehe, der Herr kommt, und jedes Auge wird ihn sehen, und auch die, die ihn durchbohrt haben, werden trauern“ (Offb 1,5-7). So kommt der Herr. Jedes Auge wird ihn sehen. Die Zeugen Jehovas sagen, dass er schon gekommen ist, aber es war ein geheimes Kommen. Da es nur die Jünger waren, die ihn gehen sahen, waren es nur die Jünger der Zeugen Jehovas, die ihn zurückkehren sahen. Jesus aber sprach: Wenn sie zu euch sagen: Er ist im Verborgenen gekommen und ist in eine geheime Kammer gegangen, so glaubt es nicht! (Mat 24:26) So habt ihr zu wählen, um Jesus oder ihnen zu glauben.<br/>Dieser Jesus, der von euch in den Himmel aufgenommen wurde, wird so kommen, wie ihr ihn in den Himmel kommen gesehen habt.<br/>Nun gibt es einen sehr interessanten Vers in 2. Johannes, Vers 1:7: „Denn viele Verführer sind in die Welt gekommen, die nicht bekennen, dass Jesus Christus im Fleisch gekommen ist.“ Das ist leider eine schlechte Übersetzung des Griechischen. Denn dieses Partizip ist im Präsens und sollte übersetzt werden "kommt im Fleisch." Jene, die leugnen würden, dass Jesus Christus im Fleisch kommt. Was sagt Johannes über sie? "Sie sind ein Betrüger und ein Antichrist. Achtet auf euch selbst, daß wir nicht verlieren, was wir getan haben, sondern daß wir vollen Lohn empfangen; denn wer übertritt und bleibt nicht in der Lehre Christi, der hat Gott nicht. Wer in der Lehre Christi bleibt, der hat sowohl den Vater als auch den Sohn; und wenn jemand an eure Tür kommt (am Samstagmorgen) und diese Lehre nicht bringt, so nehmt ihn nicht auf in euer Haus und bittet ihn nicht auf Wiedersehen. Denn wer sich von ihm verabschiedet, nimmt an seinen bösen Taten teil“ (2Joh 1,7-11). Stellen Sie ihnen eine Frage: „Kommt Jesus im Fleisch?“ Stellen Sie ihnen einfach diese Frage. Und wenn sie Nein sagen, denken Sie daran, was Johannes Sie gewarnt hat und was Johannes Ihnen gesagt hat. "Wenn jemand nicht bekennt, dass Jesus Christus im Fleisch kommt." Erinnert ihr euch, als er bei den Jüngern war und sagte: "Gib mir etwas zu essen"? Er sagte: "Weißt du, Geister essen nicht; rühr mich an. Siehst du? Dieser Jesus kommt also wieder auf dieselbe Weise, wie sie ihn in den Himmel kommen sahen, und ich glaube zum einen, dass dieses Kommen sehr bald kommt.<br/>Und sie richteten sie gen Jerusalem von dem Berge, der Ölberg heißt, der von Jerusalem eine Sabbatreise ist. Und als sie hineinkamen, gingen sie hinauf in ein Obergemach, wo sowohl Petrus als auch Jakobus und Johannes und Andreas und Philipp und Thomas und Bartholomäus und Matthäus, Jakobus, der Sohn des Alphäus, und Simon Zelotes und Judas, der Bruder des Jakobus, wohnten. Und diese alle blieben einmütig im Gebet und Flehen, mit den Frauen und Maria, der Mutter Jesu, und mit seinen Brüdern (Apg 1,12-14).<br/>Dies ist die letzte Erwähnung von Maria, der Mutter Jesu. An diesem Punkt und von diesem Punkt an gibt es keine weitere Erwähnung von ihr in der Apostelgeschichte oder in den Briefen. Keine Erwähnung ihres Todes oder ihrer wunderbaren Himmelfahrt ohne Tod. Nichts wird in der Schrift erwähnt. Es ist still.<br/>Seine Brüder würden wahrscheinlich ein Hinweis auf Jakobus und Judas und auf jene anderen Brüder sein, die Söhne von Joseph und Maria waren.<br/>Der obere Raum - es gibt einige, die sagen, dass es der gleiche obere Raum ist, in dem Jesus das Letzte Abendmahl mit seinen Jüngern hatte. Und doch gibt es andere, die an diesem oberen Raum festhalten, der ein Raum in den Tempelbezirken ist, in denen sich die frühe Kirche traf. Entscheiden Sie sich.<br/>Und in jenen Tagen Petrus stand in der Mitte der Jünger, und sagte, (die Zahl ihrer Namen zusammen waren etwa hundertzwanzig,) Männer und Brüder, diese Schrift muss notwendigerweise erfüllt worden, die der Heilige Geist durch den Mund von David sprach vor über Judas, die eine Anleitung für diejenigen, die nahm Jesus (Act 1:15-16).<br/>Auch hier ist Peter immer noch sein ungestümes Selbst. Sie warten im Gebet und Flehen, und Petrus steht auf und sagt: "Freunde, es gibt eine Schriftstelle, die erfüllt werden muss." Und du weißt, dass er weitermachen wird: „Lasst uns das Programm in Gang bringen; lasst uns Lose werfen und herausfinden, wer Judas Platz einnehmen wird.“ Ich habe das Gefühl, dass Petrus wieder im Fleisch war und diese ungestüme Natur manifestierte, die ihm gehörte. Und ich denke, dass die zukünftige Geschichte der Kirche in der Apostelgeschichte darauf hinweist. Ich interessiere mich für Peters Verständnis der Schriften, wie er aus so vielen Orten im Alten Testament zitiert. Petrus offenbart ein sehr großes Verständnis der Schriften des Alten Testaments, was ein Punkt zu seinen Gunsten ist.<br/>Beachten Sie, dass Petrus dem Heiligen Geist die Dinge zuschreibt, die David geschrieben hat. So dass "die ganze Schrift von Gott inspiriert ist" (2Ti 3:16). Nicht Teil der Schriften. Denn wenn du mir sagst, dass ein Teil der Schriften von Gott inspiriert ist, dann muss ich dich fragen: "Welche Teile sind von Inspiration und welche Teile sind nicht von Inspiration?" Und dann bist du die Autorität, die mir sagt, welchen Teil ich glauben kann und welchen Teil ich nicht glauben kann. Und in dem Moment, in dem Gott nicht mehr die Autorität ist, sondern du die Autorität bist, bin ich in Schwierigkeiten. Hütet euch vor denen, die sagen: "Nun, ihr könnt nicht alle Schriften glauben." Die Schriften selbst sagen: "Die ganze Schrift ist von Gott eingegeben." Und hier erklärt Lukas schriftlich, was Petrus sagte, dass David tatsächlich der Sprecher des Heiligen Geistes war. Der Heilige Geist sprach durch den Mund Davids über Judas.<br/>Denn er wurde mit uns gezählt, [er war einer von den Zwölfen] hatte einen Teil dieses Dienstes erhalten. Aber nun kaufte dieser Mann ein Feld mit dem Lohn der Ungerechtigkeit, und fiel kopfüber (Apg 1:17-18),<br/>Er kaufte das Feld, das Feld des Töpfers, wie Zacharias, das elfte Kapitel, erklärt.<br/>Und als er kopfüber fiel, zersprang er in der Mitte, und alle seine Eingeweide strömten heraus (Apg 1,18).<br/>Es gibt diejenigen, die eine Diskrepanz in den Schriften finden, denn in einem der Evangelien wird uns gesagt, dass Judas zurückkam und versuchte, das Geld zurückzugeben, und sie sagten: "Hey, es ist dein Problem. Wir können es nicht nehmen." Und legte es zurück in den Tempelschatz. "Es ist Blutgeld." Dann warf er es auf den Boden des Tempels und er ging hinaus und erhängte sich. Hier sagt uns Petrus, dass er kopfüber gefallen ist und gerade geknallt ist. Und es gibt diejenigen, die sich eine Diskrepanz vorstellen. Ganz einfach, er ging in den Baum, um sich aufzuhängen, band das Seil um seinen Hals und band es an die Gliedmaßen und sprang. Und die Kraft des Sturzes schnappte entweder das Seil oder seinen Kopf, und er fiel in den Canyon und genau wie er es hier sagte.<br/>Es war allen Bewohnern Jerusalems bekannt, daß das Feld in ihrer Zunge Aceldama genannt wird, das heißt das Blutfeld. Denn es steht geschrieben in dem Buch der Psalmen: "Seine Wohnung sei wüst, und niemand soll darin wohnen; und sein Bissen soll ein anderer nehmen" (Apg 1,19-20).<br/>In Wirklichkeit zitiert er hier aus zwei verschiedenen Psalmen. Aus Ps 69:25 stellt er es zusammen mit Ps 109:8. Und wenn er die beiden zusammenstellt, findet er diese Prophezeiungen über Judas.<br/>Darum von diesen Männern (Apg 1,21)<br/>Hier sind sie auf der Suche nach jemandem, der den Platz des Judas als Apostel einnimmt. Hier sind die Qualifikationen, nach denen sie in dieser Zeit gesucht haben.<br/>Darum von diesen Männern, die mit uns die ganze Zeit, dass der Herr Jesus, wenn in und aus unter uns (Apg 1:21),<br/>Nun erinnert ihr euch, dass es viele Jünger gab, viele Jünger, von denen Jesus zehn Apostel wählte. Und das Wort Apostel bedeutet „einer, der ausgesandt wird“. Oder wählte zwölf Apostel, also sandte er die Zwölf aus. Die Zahl der menschlichen Regierung. "Wir haben nur elf. Wir brauchen einen, der den Platz des Judas einnimmt, aber wir brauchen einen, der von Anfang an mit Jesus bei uns war."<br/>Von der Zeit an, als er von Johannes getauft wurde, bis zu dem Tag, an dem er von uns aufgenommen wurde, muss einer zum Zeugen seiner Auferstehung bestimmt werden (Apg 1,22).<br/>Das waren also die Anforderungen, nach denen sie suchten. Jemand, der die ganze Zeit über gewesen war. Von der Zeit der Taufe des Johannes bis zur Himmelfahrt. Und jemand, der den auferstandenen Herrn sah und so die Tatsache der Auferstehung ertragen konnte, ihr Zeugnis für die Tatsache.<br/>Paulus, der Apostel, behauptete später, dass er ein Apostel war, und sagte: „Habe ich den auferstandenen Christus nicht gesehen?“ Das war offensichtlich eine der Anforderungen des Apostelamts. Jemand fragte mich: „Gibt es heute Apostel?“ Nun, ich weiß es nicht. Ich glaube nicht, dass es im selben Sinne wie im Neuen Testament gibt. Sicherlich gibt es heute niemanden, der die Auferstehung so bezeugen kann, wie sie es getan haben.<br/>Und sie bestellten zwei, Joseph genannt Barsabas, der hieß Justus, und Matthias. Und sie beteten und sprachen: Du, Herr, der du die Herzen aller Menschen kennst, zeige, ob du von diesen beiden erwählt hast (Apg 1,23-24),<br/>Ich denke, dass wir oft diesen Fehler machen, dem Herrn zwei Wahlmöglichkeiten zu geben, beide falsch. Gott zu begrenzen, seht ihr. Wir sind so geneigt, dies zu tun. Offensichtlich war Paulus Gottes Wahl. Peter war ungestüm, und als er mit der Waffe sprang, sagte er: "Hey, wir müssen etwas tun, weißt du, wir müssen Gott helfen. Weißt du, einer fehlt und wir müssen ihn füllen." Und doch, "Gott, welcher von diesen beiden willst du?" Und Gott die beiden Wahlmöglichkeiten geben.<br/>damit er teilhaftig werde an diesem Amt und an diesem Apostelamt, von dem Judas durch die Übertretung abgefallen ist, um an seinen Ort zu gehen; und so gaben sie ihr Los (Apg 1,25-26);<br/>Eine interessante Art und Weise, mit der sie versuchten, den Willen Gottes zu bestimmen. Lassen Sie uns Würfel werfen, finden Sie heraus, was Gottes Wille hier ist. Es ist interessant für mich, die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten, die Menschen entwickelt haben, um den Willen Gottes zu erkennen. Nun, in der Zeit des Alten Testaments hatten sie eine interessante Art und Weise, zum Priester zu kommen, der den Herrn für sie durch die Urim und die Thummim, die "Lichter und Vollkommenheiten" fragen würde. Was genau diese Urim und Thummim waren, wissen wir nicht. Ich bin mir sicher, dass es nicht die farbigen Gläser waren, die Joseph Smith mit den Goldenen Tablets fand; die magischen Gläser, die man, wenn man sie anzog, plötzlich die Hieroglyphenschrift lesen konnte.<br/>Es gibt Leute, die sagen, dass Urim und Thummim tatsächlich ein schwarzer und ein weißer Stein waren, der in einem Beutel auf der Brust des Priesters getragen wurde. Sie beteten und stellten dem Herrn eine besondere Frage. Ihr erinnert euch, dass David dem Herrn bestimmte Fragen stellte: „Herr, sollen wir gegen die Philister ausziehen?“ Die Antwort war: „Nein.“ Am nächsten Tag also wieder: „Herr, sollen wir gegen die Philister ausziehen?“ Die Antwort war: „Ja.“ „Wann sollen wir gehen?“ Sie würden spezifische Fragen stellen, und der Herr würde sie durch den Urim und den Thummin leiten. Sie sagen, dass der Priester beten, Gott suchen und dann hineingreifen und einen der beiden Steine herausziehen würde. Wenn es der weiße Stein war, war es eine Ja-Antwort. Wenn es ein Nein wäre, dann wäre es der schwarze Stein, den er herausziehen würde. Einige sagen sogar, dass wir den Begriff von diesem Urim und Thummim verbannen lassen. Eigentlich ist es im Original eine Nein-Stimme gegen ein bestimmtes Projekt oder eine bestimmte Idee. Wir wissen nicht, was die Urim und Thummim waren, aber während der Zeit des Alten Testaments benutzten sie eine Methode, Lose zu werfen, um den Willen Gottes zu bestimmen.<br/>Hier greifen die Jünger das Gleiche auf, wie sie die Würfel werfen, um zu sehen, welcher der beiden Gefährten, die Gott erwählt hatte, Judas Iskariot zu ersetzen.<br/>Das Los fiel auf Matthias; er wurde mit den Elfen gezählt (Apg 1:26).<br/>Nun, wer in der Welt ist Matthias? Niemand hat je zuvor oder danach von ihm gehört. Es wird interessant sein, Matthias zu treffen und herauszufinden, wer er ist und was er getan hat. Ich denke, aus der nachfolgenden Geschichte ist es offensichtlich anzunehmen, dass Gott Paulus als Apostel erwählt hat. Paulus erklärt es selbst. Jetzt ist dies das letzte Mal, dass wir von ihnen lesen, die versuchen, den Willen Gottes durch Loswerfen oder durch Zufall zu erkennen.<br/>Ich weiß, dass heute ein Mensch, der versucht, den Willen des Herrn zu erkennen, beten und den Herrn um eine Frage bitten wird. Er wird zehn Pfennige in der Tasche haben, und während er betet, nimmt er die Pfennige mit geschlossenen Augen und legt sie auf den Tisch, und wenn sie alle Köpfe hochkommen, ist es ein Ja. Eine interessante Sache, von Zeit zu Zeit werden sie alle Köpfe hochkommen, und das sind ziemlich gute Chancen. Wir finden jedoch kein Muster dafür, nachdem der Heilige Geist gegeben wurde. Als der Heilige Geist über die Gemeinde kam, fing der Heilige Geist an, zu ihnen zu sprechen und sie zu leiten, und der Heilige Geist sagte: „Tretet zu mir Paulus und Barnabas für den Dienst, zu dem ich sie berufen habe“ (Apg 13,2). Und der Heilige Geist hat sie ausgesandt. So finden wir die Kirche direkter vom Heiligen Geist geleitet. Sobald der Heilige Geist kam, wurde dieser Würfelwurf, um den Willen Gottes herauszufinden, beiseite gelegt.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>Dies ist die 1769 King James Version der Bibel (auch als autorisierte Version bekannt).

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Gabor T. Rittersporn sagte: „Viele der Opfer waren den Prinzipien des Bolschewismus aufrichtig ergeben.“ Dies verstärkt den Beweis, dass die bolschewistischen Ideale, die einst die Wurzeln der Kommunistischen Partei waren, durch die Säuberungen ungeordnet und zerstört wurden. Die Partei war erschöpft und ehemalige Mitglieder sahen hilflos zu, wie Stalin die große Säuberung als Werkzeug benutzte, um Russland von einem Einparteienstaat in eine unangefochtene Diktatur zu verwandeln. Wieder erschütterten die Säuberungen den Rahmen der Kommunistischen Partei, die während der bolschewistischen Revolution gebildet wurde.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell nervt die Brawler, anstatt die Starpowers zu nerven. Ich war letzte Saison bei 750 mit Power 8 Nita und es ist sehr schwierig, daran vorbeizugehen, dass Starpowers eine wirklich dominierende Rolle spielen. Das Matchmaking ist auch Müll. Wenn ich gem grab (rund 600 trophäen) spiele, gibt es oft matchups, bei denen das gegnerische team einen mehr spieler hat als wir, der maximiert ist, und es ist nicht einmal so, dass wir einen lvl 9 haben, um gegen das zu konkurrieren. Manchmal gibt es sogar Matchups, bei denen das gegnerische Team voll ausgelastet ist und keiner von uns. Deshalb spiele ich keine Brawl-Stars mehr ernst. Es ist nicht einmal so, dass es nicht viele Spieler gibt, die nicht ausgelastet sind und etwa 600 Trophäen. Es ist ärgerlich.<br/>Edit: Ich denke, Supercell sollte mindestens einen grundlegenden Mechanismus haben, der den Durchschnitt der Brawler-Levels beim Einrichten von Matches berücksichtigt.<br/><br/>Außer Trophäen zeigen nicht wirklich deine Fähigkeiten an. Sie zeigen die Fähigkeiten der Teamkollegen an, mit denen du platziert bist. Und es geht mir gut, gegen höhere Level-Brawler zu spielen, aber wenn ein Team alle Level 10 ist und das andere Team nicht, ist es eindeutig unausgewogen.<br/><br/>Ich empfehle, ein paar gute Freunde zu bekommen, mit denen ich spielen kann, ich und zwei Freunde haben meinen Freunden Power 1 Tick auf Rang 28 gegeben, indem sie den ganzen Tag mit einer bestimmten Komposition gem grab gespielt haben, und wir haben es geschafft, ohne dass einer von uns mit unseren Schlägern maxiert wurde.<br/><br/>Ich weiß, wie du dich fühlst, dass ich schläger in hohen trophäen mit niedrigem level hatte und es ist zu schwierig, weiter zu gehen und alles, was ich zu mir selbst sagte, ich möchte sternenkräfte haben, muss wirklich supercell balance zu den sternenkräften machen oder zumindest ein besseres matchmaking-system machen.<br/><br/>Ich fühle mich irgendwie so. Ich bin nicht so gut im Spiel wie du, aber ich habe Emz bei Macht 1 auf 500 gebracht und das Matchmaking war schrecklich. Spieler überall ausgereizt! Und es hat nicht geholfen, dass die Mehrheit meiner Teamkollegen etwa 5-8k Trophäen hatte... Ich musste in letzter Minute auf Solo-Showdown zurückgreifen, weil ich entweder ahnungslose Spieler überfallen oder einfach ein wenig aggressiv zur richtigen Zeit spielen kann. Aber ich wünschte mir wirklich, dass es ein bisschen einfacher für Leute sein könnte, die Brawler in wirklich hohe Trophäenbereiche bringen wollen, ohne den Luxus von Sternenmächten zu haben.<br/><br/>Altho Spike ist immer noch gut ohne Curveball. Curveball war nur eine Hilfe, um Ihre Schüsse öfter als Spike zu treffen. Aber noch bevor Curveball veröffentlicht wurde, war Spike ein wirklich starker Brawler, also wird er jetzt derselbe bleiben.<br/><br/>Ich stimme zu, dass sie einen Hinterhalt hätten nerven sollen, aber ich denke, sie versuchen, sowohl Snappy Sniping als auch Ambush auszugleichen, da sie beide mit dieser Veränderung verschmolzen werden. Sie wurde ein wenig mächtig, aber immer noch nicht nervenwürdig<br/><br/>Ich bin mir nicht sicher, aber jetzt, da Darryl einen spürbaren Buff bekommen hat, sieht es so aus, als könnte Darryl Bull überschatten, da er nicht nur immer mehr Schaden anrichten kann als Bull, er wird nicht mehr so früh sterben, so dass ihre Überlebensfähigkeit ohne Starkraft ähnlich sein wird (obwohl Bulls Überlebensfähigkeit immer noch merklich besser ist als Darryl, wenn er Tough Guy hätte). Nicht nur das, Darryls Super kann sich automatisch regenerieren, was bedeutet, dass Darryl sowohl als Schwergewicht als auch als Attentäter gleichzeitig effektiv gespielt werden kann (bevor er als Schwergewicht, aber anständig als Attentäter saugt).<br/><br/>Aber er ist überschätzt af. Und man bekommt Trophäen mit ihm wirklich leicht. Also im irgendwie ok mit dem nerf. Ich habe ihn nicht einmal gespielt, da, als ich ihn auf 500 (vor etwa 5 Monaten) bekam, so dass es mir auch nicht so sehr egal ist.<br/><br/>Warum bekommt Poco/Penny keinen HP Nerf, wenn sie Marksman/Healer bzw. kein Panzer sind?<br/>Warum wird Rosas Tankyness nicht genervt, Husten 70% Schadensreduktion?<br/>Warum darf Tick die höchste Reichweite und die meisten kostenlosen Pokedamage im gesamten Spiel haben?<br/>Warum bekommt Leon keinen HP/Damage-Buff?<br/><br/>Wie dem auch sei, es war Ambush, das OP war, nicht Basis Piper. Ich würde argumentieren, dass Ambush die beste Star-Power im Spiel ist (jetzt noch mehr, da der Prozentsatz des Schadensanstiegs indirekt gestiegen ist) und Basis Piper ein Bottom-10-Brawler war.<br/><br/>Was Supercell tun sollte, ist, beide Nerfs rückgängig zu machen, Ambush auf 600 zu reduzieren und Snappy Sniping auf 0,25 zu reduzieren, da es indirekt durch den Grundschadensbuff aufgepeppt würde.<br/><br/>Yea und ich glauben, dass sie mit Rosa ein bisschen zu weit gegangen sind, denn jetzt ist sie im Grunde genommen der bessere Bulle, wenn es um das Tanken geht, was sie seit einiger Zeit ist. Jetzt könnte Darryl genauso gut ein kleinerer, mächtigerer Bulle sein<br/><br/>Warum? Ich habe das Gefühl, sie braucht einen Buff in fast allem, außer ihrer Star-Power. Ihre Gesundheit und Geschwindigkeit machen sie super ein bisschen schwieriger zu bedienen, weil sie ziemlich leicht sterben kann, und es ist wirklich schwierig für sie, schnellere Schläger wie Crow zu fangen. Ihre Star-Power ist ein wenig gebrochen... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Selbstständigkeit Teil 1<br/><br/>Wenn sie eine beschäftigung in einer organisation annehmen, müssen sie verschiedene jobs gemäß den anforderungen ihres arbeitgebers ausführen, und sie können einen festen einkommensbetrag als gehalt erhalten. Sie können ein kleines Einzelhandelsgeschäft, Schneiderei, Restaurant, Bäckerei und Konditorei, Schönheitssalon usw. in Ihrer Nähe betreiben. Sie können sich im Handel oder in der Herstellung in kleinem Maßstab engagieren oder einen Service zu einem Preis anbieten. Solche wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten werden als Selbständigkeit bezeichnet.<br/><br/>Bedeutung von Self-Employment<br/><br/>Unser Vater, unsere Mutter, unsere Brüder, Schwestern und andere können in verschiedenen wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten tätig sein, durch die sie ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen. Diese Personen sind in einer wirtschaftlichen Tätigkeit tätig, die als Lohnbeschäftigung oder bezahlte Beschäftigung bezeichnet wird, aber es gibt viele Personen, die sich einer Beschäftigung oder einem Unternehmen widmen, das sie selbst gründen und führen. Sie geben sich alle Mühe und gehen alle möglichen Risiken ein, um ihre Karriere erfolgreich zu verfolgen. Der gesamte Verdienst ihrer Arbeit geht an sie. Alle von uns haben kleine Lebensmittelgeschäfte, Schneidereien, medizinische Geschäfte usw. in unserer Gegend gesehen. Diese befinden sich im Besitz und werden von einer Person mit oder ohne Hilfe einiger Assistenten verwaltet. Ihre wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten werden als Selbständigkeit bezeichnet. Wenn eine Person also eine wirtschaftliche Tätigkeit ausübt und diese selbstständig ausübt, wird dies als Selbständigkeit bezeichnet.<br/><br/>Ziele<br/><br/>Nachdem Sie diese Lektion gelernt haben, können Sie:<br/><br/>Image der Ziele<br/><br/>Image der Ziele<br/><br/>Merkmale der Selbstständigkeit<br/><br/>Es beinhaltet das Eigentum und die Verwaltung von Aktivitäten durch eine Person, obwohl er / sie die Hilfe von einer oder zwei Personen in Anspruch nehmen kann, um ihn / sie zu unterstützen.<br/><br/>Das Einkommen aus selbständiger Tätigkeit ist nicht festgelegt. Es hängt von dem Einkommen ab, das man durch die Herstellung oder den Kauf und Verkauf von Waren oder die Erbringung von Dienstleistungen für andere zu einem Preis verdienen kann.<br/><br/>In der Selbständigkeit muss der Eigentümer allein den Gewinn übernehmen und das Verlustrisiko tragen. So finden wir einen direkten Zusammenhang zwischen Aufwand und Belohnung in der Selbständigkeit.<br/><br/>Es erfordert eine gewisse Menge an Kapitalinvestitionen, obwohl es klein sein kann.<br/><br/>In der Selbstständigkeit steht es einer Person frei, Entscheidungen zu treffen, um ihr Geschäft profitabel zu führen und jede Gelegenheit zu nutzen, die sich für die Expansion ihres Geschäfts ergeben könnte. Es gibt völlige Freiheit, nach eigenem Willen und innerhalb der Parameter der vorherrschenden Gesetze zu arbeiten.<br/><br/>So kann Selbständigkeit definiert werden als eine wirtschaftliche Tätigkeit, die man allein als Erwerbstätigkeit ausüben kann, und dies kann darin bestehen, Waren zu produzieren und zu verkaufen, Waren zu kaufen und zu verkaufen oder Dienstleistungen zu einem Preis zu erbringen. |
