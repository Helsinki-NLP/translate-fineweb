| Truly Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Takes Voice Commands<br/><br/>Most Bluetooth headsets are perfectly capable of the voice dial thing, assuming that the connected mobile phone can do it, but the BlueAnt V1 takes voice control to a new high. The incredibly compact Bluetooth headset is being marketed as the first ever with a true voice-based user interface.<br/><br/>Instead of clicking a physical button to answer your calls, you simply speak into the microphone and say "accept call". Other basic voice commands could include "volume up", "reject call", or "do the laundry". Okay, maybe it won't do that last thing, but you can see how a completely handsfree experience like that offered by the BlueAnt V1 can be excellent for drivers and other people who need their hands. That is why you're using a Bluetooth headset in the first place.<br/><br/>The downside is that the voice control can be "wonky" and it can be quite frustrating when you accidentally give it a command that you don't want it to do. What happens if you're in a call with someone and you happens to say "end call"? | Fíor Handsfree Bluetooth Headset Bíonn Comharthaí Gutha<br/><br/>Tá an chuid is mó de na cluasáin Bluetooth in ann an rud dhiailiú gutha a dhéanamh, ag glacadh leis gur féidir leis an bhfón póca nasctha é a dhéanamh, ach tógann an BlueAt V1 rialú guth chuig ard nua. Tá an headset Bluetooth thar a bheith dlúth á mhargú mar an chéad cheann riamh le comhéadan úsáideora fíor-bhunaithe guth.<br/><br/>In ionad cliceáil cnaipe fisiciúil a fhreagairt do glaonna, labhraíonn tú go simplí isteach sa micreafón agus a rá "glacadh glaoch". D'fhéadfadh orduithe eile guth bunúsach a bheith san áireamh "imleabhar suas", " dhiúltú glaoch", nó "a dhéanamh ar an níocháin". Ceart go leor, b'fhéidir ní bheidh sé a dhéanamh go bhfuil an rud seo caite, ach is féidir leat a fheiceáil conas a taithí go hiomlán handfree mar sin ar fáil ag an BlueAnt V1 Is féidir a bheith den scoth do thiománaithe agus do dhaoine eile a bhfuil gá acu a lámha. Sin é an fáth go bhfuil headset Bluetooth á úsáid agat sa chéad áit.<br/><br/>Is é an míbhuntáiste is féidir leis an rialú guth a bheith "winky" agus is féidir é a frustrach go leor nuair a thabhairt duit thaisme ordú nach bhfuil tú ag iarraidh é a dhéanamh., Cad a tharlaíonn má tá tú i glaoch le duine agus a tharlaíonn tú a rá "deireadh glaoch"? |
| Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br/><br/>Going to college? DREAM on<br/><br/>Here is another great article about our failing (and increasingly ridiculous) immigration system, this time from the Boston Globe. A 18-year undocumented immigrant from Massachusetts was awarded a four-year scholarship at any state university because of her high test scores, but this was later rescinded once state officials found out about her immigration status. As the author of the article so rightly says,<br/><br/>"So much for celebrating the building blocks for success and the American dream. Romney says, tough luck if you are smart, hardworking, and the child of illegal immigrants."<br/><br/>It's beyond me why anyone wants to keep smart, high-achieving kids like this one out of college. Does anybody really think that denying in-state tuition and scholarships to undocumented immigrants will make any potential immigrants think twice about coming here to work? Or are policies like these motivated by fear? Despite the increasingly widespread movement in favor of the DREAM Act and state laws (see this previous post) to allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, it seems like the power of fear is growing.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Mass. Gov. Romney is bashing undocumented immigrants now - this article in the Economist shows how his campaign to end gay marriage in Massachusetts is closely linked to his anticipated run for the presidency in 2008. Here in New York, presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has gone to the right on immigration, claiming that she is "adamantly against illegal immigrants." It's unfortunate that the way to get ahead in politics (particularly in the red states) is to blame immigrants for our problems. It will be interesting to see if an increased Latino turnout in places like the Southwest will prove Hillary wrong.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>Maybe people do not want illegal aliens to get scholarhips for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Their parents violated the law to enter the country. 2. Their parents had to steal someone's identity to work in this country. 3. Their parents have to cheat on their income taxes (and other taxes) to stay here. 4. Their parents had to lie to get their children admitted. 5. their parents lied on applications for things like free lunch.<br/><br/>First, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that all children have the right to public education regardless of immigration status. Schools are prohibited from asking about a child's immigration status, meaning that undocumented parents do not have to "lie" to get their kids free lunch.<br/><br/>Second, many immigrants do not have to use another identity or cheat on income taxes in order to work here -- many employers knowingly hire undocumented immigrants (this has been happening for some time - the 1986 Imm. Reform and Control Act's attempted to deal with it, and many anti-immigrant advocates argue that employer sanctions need to be strengthened today) and quite a few immigrants pay income taxes and other taxes that they never end up receiving the benefits of (the New York Times reported that illegal immigrants provide social security with a subsidy of $7 billion a year).<br/><br/>Finally, if the biggest problem with undocumented immigrants is that they are breaking the law by being here, should that same standard be applied to businesses that knowingly hire them (which, by the way, is also against the law even though it is rarely enforced)? Should the kids of these businesspeople be denied the same opportunities because their parents broke the law? Could we extend this argument to the children of everyone who has ever broken the law in this country?<br/><br/>Whatever you think about illegal immigration, the point is that the kids should not be punished for their parents' decisions to come here. Especially when these bright and hardworking undocumented students have the potential to contribute so much to our society. | Dé Céadaoin, Iúil 06, 2005<br/><br/>Ag dul chuig an gcoláiste? DERM on<br/><br/>Seo alt iontach eile faoi ár gcóras inimirce teip (agus níos ridiculous), an uair seo ó Boston Globe. Bronnadh scoláireacht ceithre bliana in aon ollscoil stáit arimirceach gan doiciméad 18 mbliana ó Massachusetts mar gheall ar a scóir ard-tástála, ach rinneadh é seo a athchúrsa arís ina dhiaidh sin nuair a fuarthas amach faoina stádas inimirce. Mar údar an earra a deir an ceart sin,<br/><br/>An oiread sin chun ceiliúradh a dhéanamh ar na bloic thógála le haghaidh rath agus aisling Mheiriceá. Deir Romney, ádh mór má tá tú cliste, dícheallach, agus leanbh inimircigh neamhdhleathacha."<br/><br/>Tá sé níos faide dom cén fáth ar mhaith le duine ar bith páistí cliste, ardghnóthachtála mar an coláiste seo a choinneáil. An gceapann duine ar bith i ndáiríre go ndéanfaidh sé, de bharr teagasc in-stáit agus scoláireachtaí d’inimircigh gan doiciméid, aon inimircigh a d’fhéadfadh a bheith ag smaoineamh faoi dhó anseo le bheith ag obair? Nó an bhfuil beartais mar seo spreagtha ag eagla? In ainneoin an ghluaiseacht ag éirí níos forleithne i bhfabhar Acht DREAM agus dlíthe an stáit (féach an post roimhe seo) chun ligean do mhic léinn gan doiciméid teagasc in-stáit a íoc, is cosúil go bhfuil an chumhacht eagla ag fás.<br/><br/>Tá sé suimiúil go bhfuil Aifreann. Gov. Romney toirmeasc inimircigh gan doiciméid anois - léiríonn an t-alt seo san Eacnamaís conas a deireadh a pósadh aerach i Massachusetts nasctha go dlúth lena reáchtáil ag súil leis ar an uachtaránacht i 2008. Anseo i Nua-Eabhrac, glacadh leis go bhfuil an t-eachtránaí Daonlathach Hillary Clinton imithe go dtí an ceart ar inimirce, ag maíomh go bhfuil sí "ag iarraidh in aghaidh inimircigh neamhdhleathacha". Is é an trua go bhfuil an bealach chun dul ar aghaidh sa pholaitíocht (go háirithe sna stáit dearga) ná imircigh a chur amú inár bhfadhbanna.Beidh sé suimiúil a fheiceáil an mbeidh toradh méadaithe Latino in áiteanna mar an Southwest a chruthú Hillary mícheart.<br/><br/>3 comments:<br/><br/>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil daoine ag iarraidh eachtrannaigh mídhleathacha chun scoláireachtaí a fháil ar na cúiseanna seo a leanas:<br/><br/>Bhí ar a tuismitheoirí an dlí chun dul isteach sa tír. 2.

| ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Corporations are not people and money is not speech<br/><br/>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned century-old restrictions on corporate spending in elections under the guise of protecting First Amendment free speech rights. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech." This argument of the majority decision rests on the notions that corporations are covered by the same free speech protections as individual citizens and that campaign donations or financing are the same as speech.<br/><br/>Corporations, however, are inherently not the same as individuals and thus cannot have the same protections as individuals. There are a slew of laws that protect corporations and their interests in the arena for which they are by definition formed—namely the marketplace. The laws that govern corporations and the rights enjoyed by them are distinct from the laws and rights of individuals. A corporation, for example, can enter into contracts like an individual, but unlike an individual, a corporation's members can be protected by limited liability so their personal assets are not at stake.<br/><br/>If a corporation, then, is a distinct legal entity governed by different laws than an individual is, corporations are not protected under the First Amendment in the same way that individuals are protected. Corporations, especially in their most powerful and wealthy incarnations, are exponentially more influential than most individuals in America. The restrictions on corporate spending in elections that were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court were meant to redress this power balance between average individuals and unduly influential businesses. Corporations already have a plethora of ways to influence politics, from political action committees to lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The framers of the Bill of Rights wanted to protect the voices of the trampled, not amplify the voices of the elite.<br/><br/>The other part of the Supreme Court's premise for its decision is that the First Amendment free speech clause applies to campaign funding. While speech can be interpreted loosely as any form of expression, such an open, ambiguous definition would create a myriad of problems with all kinds of laws. An architect has a vision of a building: it is his art, his self expression, yet he cannot ignore local zoning laws that, for instance, restrict the height of his building. Should he sue the state for violation of his free speech, his right to expression? Equating money with speech also opens the door to sundry ludicrous claims by, for instance, an employer who objects to minimum wage laws since he'd like to express that his employees are only worth paying $3 an hour. There have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment.<br/><br/>A corporation already has the power to issue a statement in favor of a candidate or policy through its political action committees, and individual members of a business are welcome to contribute money as well. However, allowing a corporation to use its vast profits to directly finance the election or to remove a candidate compromises the democratic notion of a free and fair election. There are unseemly ties even now between politicians and various industries, but this new ruling would make such connections more robust and give them a veneer of legitimacy. A politician financed by a business would become completely beholden to its political agenda and not to the voters.<br/><br/>It's not only the independence of politicians that's at stake, but also the independence of our judges, who are at the very least expected to be impartial. Many states still use elections to appoint judges, which leaves them vulnerable to the influence of political spending. In a recent speech at a law school conference, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor worried about the impact of corporate campaign funding in judicial elections, saying that "judicial campaigning makes last week's decision in Citizens United an increasing problem for maintaining an independent judiciary."<br/><br/>Two cornerstones of our democracy—free elections and an independent judiciary—are threatened by the Supreme Court's activist and meddling decision. The case could have been decided much more narrowly in favor of Citizens United, but instead, the majority of the justices decided to expand the case to champion the rights of big money over the interest of the American people. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act last March. It would prohibit contributions from political action committees and would match individual donations, limited to $100, on a 4:1 basis so that fundraising focuses on the people. Such a system has been in place in New York City since the 1988 Campaign Finance Act. The rest of the country is long overdue to follow. Never before has the fight for public financing been more necessary.<br/><br/>The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. She is a prospective law student.<br/><br/>The 14th amendment, which was one of the Reconstruction amendments added following the War of Northern Aggression was never legally ratified by the States and has caused more problems than all the other post-war amendments combined. If my memory serves me right, corporations were declared by the Supreme Court to be 14th Amemdment citizens during the late 1800s or early 1900s. In case you are unfamiliar with the wording of this amendment, it basically made everyone a citizen (and subject) of the United States. Prior to the War, all individuals were citizens of the State within which they resided and no one was a citizen of the United States nor were they subject to the jurisdiction of the United States except for those who resided in the District of Columbia or resided within one of the territories under the jurisdiction of the United States. The main purposes of the War of Northern Aggression was to destroy the soverienty of the individual States and reduce the status of every American to that of a subject under the control and jurisdiction of the United States government. The founding fathers set up our government as a loose confederation of Sovereign States with the States exercising all meaningful polical power. They never invisioned or intended any effective political power to reside in Washington. Things will only get much worse until We the People throw the theives and money changers out of Washington and restore our government back to what it once was.<br/><br/>The word person means corporation in law. It is not that corporations are not people, it is that people are not corporations. We have been tricked into accepting a corporate identity[ALL CAPS]. Look at your drivers license. Every time we go to court,we go as a corporation, not as a natural person.The first corporations were governments. Looked at logically, limited liability for a corporation is the extension of sovereign immunity to the king after he was no longer king. The same ruling elite families are still in control and that goes all the way back to the first known about extraterrestrials[anunaki] that the Sumerian documents talk about.The same group also take the credit or blame for all the religions and secret societies.<br/><br/>What difference does it make? Really. Think about it, the whole entire Congress and Senate are a dog and pony show, the real power brokers who control it all are in the shadows, working the deals, doing what they want, with the AL-CIA-DA and MOSSAD out there killing everyone who disagrees with these shadow government assholes who truly run it all.<br/><br/>So, why is it so important now to be so upset over this shit? Why now? After more than two hundred years of absolute proof that the politicians are just a fancy hand puppet show to distract us from the REAL WHEELING AND DEALING IN THE BACK ROOMS elsewhere, why does it matter now that the total contempt of democracy is being demonstrated by SCOTUS in this ruling? The assholes on this court know that the real guys with their hands on the power levers of the system aren't in the Congress and the Senate.<br/><br/>When the Rule of Law became OBSOLETE in the world, in general, and everything became more or less ROLLERBALL only this time, on STEROIDS, for and by the CORPORATIONS, why did this sole ruling make all that much difference? Why do all of you assholes think that this 'lagging' indicator of the end of any semblances of democratic government makes any difference.<br/><br/>Hypothetically, let's say this ruling had not happened. Do any of you think that the corporations and the moneyed influences in the shadows wouldn't have continued to exert any and all of their will on the rest of us?<br/><br/>For those of you who think it'd been different, I suggest you find a remedy to your TOTAL NAIVETE!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this ruling didn't make one iota of a difference. It was always like this, long before SCOTUS basically said to corporations; "go ahead, do what the fuck you want…the little people are just cannon fodder for your wars, chattel for you to barter and sell at your leisure.."<br/><br/>democracy was always an illusion. We never ever had any control, ever. making such a mountain out of this mole hill is absolutely unwarranted, in light of the fact that for the whole entire 230 year history of this republic, the fat cats and the rich oligarchs never needed any Congress or Senate to do what they pleased, under any circumstances, ever. They just did it.<br/><br/>The government you were looking at was a chimera, not real..<br/><br/>the sooner you all come to that realization, the sooner we can get on with less pissing and moaning over a mere joke of a technicality that was always the case from day one, and was not foisted on us by the SCOTUS, the court only quite belatedly declared to us what has been happening for a long long long, corrupt time.<br/><br/>I've got a mad crush on Exxon, and Exxon has one on me, wedding bells in the spring – a bit quick I know, but our love can't be denied. Exxon is a little shy, so don't expect any public announcements, we're thinking a quiet wedding in Reno.<br/><br/>Any business is simply a group of individuals (small or large) exercising their individual rights collectively. Therefore, any business has the same rights as those individuals (except, of course, the right to vote, which is reserved to the individuals themselves). The freedom to dispose of one's wealth as one sees fit comes along with the freedom to earn it. If an aggregate of individuals has earned money, it should be free to decide how do dispose of that money. The real problem is not that businesses can donate to campaigns, it is that the government has been allowed to meddle in business – i.e. that the government can grant some favor in return for that money. We need separation of commerce and state in the same way and for the same reasons as we have separation of church and state. I also find it interesting that the author chose as examples two laws (zoning and minimum wage) that also violate individual rights. The first violates property rights and the second violates the rights of individuals to contract freely.<br/><br/>under your jackoffian analysis, nobody should interfere with anything anyone does at all. say, if I were in a crowd, with a saturday night special, and I want to 'free speech' your butt with it much in the same way the CIA free speeched Bobby Kennedy in L.A. one night, that's fine, because to interfere with me is interfering with my right to free speech you.<br/><br/>that's the critical flaw with you libertarian assholes….you think that there is no societal role for any rule of law, that anything that fits under 'ends justify means' rationale shouldn't ever be interfered with, just let everyone do whatever they so choose, and it all works out. That Ayn Rand bullshit doesn't work, dude! It works right up to the point where someone else pays a price for your 'whatever i wanna do' freedom crosses a line and then interfere with my freedom.<br/><br/>rules and laws SHOULD exist in the framework of society strictly to keep in check that good old "I can do anything I want to and it's just me being free" line of horse shit.<br/><br/>Corporations do not have any rights, dorkus! globally, they have been the reason why there are so many failed states, pillaged by the will of corporatocrats based in the U.S.S.A. who think that freedom of their speech translates into; "do what we tell you or we'll bomb you to get your resources we need" kind of raping and pillaging.<br/><br/>someday, I hope some asshole fucks you with their 'free speech' and then we'll hear your sorry ass whine about how the law let you down. What law? In your libertarian world of 'I can do what I want', the only rule of law is the one you make up to justify your end goal. For you then, it'll be fun to see how you cope with some other asshole's interpretation of your boundary being just a little bit of a mere inconvenience for his goals, which didn't necessarily respect your boundaries at all, for damned sure!<br/><br/>Someone by the name of "uh huh, right.." might have a logical point hidden in the forest of name-calling and straw-man abuse, but how about this: Corporations are inventions of the State that are created to pass some of the risks of doing business from the people running the business over to the stockholders (if any), the customers (if any) and the public. So if a corporation commits a fraud, it is the corporation that's punished (usually) and fined and the people who run the corporation get to walk away with a golden handshake. And the cost of the fine is passed along to the customers and paid to the government (not the victims!). To "David"s point, if we were to separate government and commerce, corporations would cease to exist! Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think that the point is, that if a corporation commits a financial crime, and nobody notices (the if the tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it truly make a noise argument) then did a crime actually take place?<br/><br/>and in a veitch diagram, where the two blobs collide and interact, if one encroaches on the other one's boundary, who is the arbiter of who got violated?<br/><br/>my point is this: there are no straw man arguments with regard to david's asinine assessment that corporations can do whatever they want with abandon. the truth of the matter is, granting corporations, and oligarchs, or whomever, a license to do what they want, whenever they want, under the premise that THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS and hence, guaranteed FREE SPEECH, is both absurd and horse shit.<br/><br/>corporations are made up of groups of people. people who should live by some semblance of Rule of Law. When they don't have to, then it's "I can do anything I want as long as nobody catches me or holds me accountable for my transgressions" going on here.<br/><br/>if that's the world David wants to live in, let him go there and make it happen, but goddamn it, don't expect me not to fucking object to that shit!<br/><br/>We can all get along, just as long as boundaries are not gratuitously violated at will by anyone who thinks their right to do what they want actually nullifies my right not to be interfered with by their actions.<br/><br/>with regard to corporations, they have no right to violate my rights, or yours, or anyone elses. If they can't function in the community as a benevolent and hence, non interfering entity, then they have no right to exist.<br/><br/>and David wasn't being threatened. he's an asshole for asserting that "do what you want, it's freedom of speech" is a bunch of horse shit. It's la la land bullshit. And I object to anyone or anything violating my boundaries with that free speech assertion. That's a crock of shit and you know it is!<br/><br/>Well, that was a colorful response. Sadly, "uh-uh", you are way off the mark. I never said people have the right to infringe on anyone else's rights…and I repudiate "ends justify the means" thinking. Yes, laws SHOULD exist, but ONLY to PROTECT the rights of people. I'm sorry you have such a warped and horribly incorrect view of my argument.<br/><br/>your point well taken, David. I apologize for peeing in your corn flakes. I think I thought you were inferring that corporations were able to do whatever they pleased under this right of FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which in Amerk'a is a joke today because the PATRIOT ACT and a non-declared state of MARTIAL LAW we've been living under since Sept. 2001, has given the government the ability to suspend and or 'shred' the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>sadly, people have only a few rights. we have the right to be taxed to the point of absurdity. we have the right to be conscripted and become cannon fodder for oligarch wars. and we have the right to shut the fuck up and be quiet while we are being joy boinked by corporations and oligarchs and bankers. those are our rights, and sadly, they truly SUCKETH, David. I think we can agree on that!<br/><br/>I'm still wondering how the newbie, Roberts, inherited the Chief Justiceship after Rhenquist rather than that role going to someone with more experience on the bench. What does "The Roberts Court" plan to do next, though, for corporations? Give them the right to vote at the polls like real people?; perhaps have votes by human beings counted as 3/5 of a person or less to their 1?<br/><br/>I haven't read all of the 183-page booklength "ruling" yet but find these appalling statements therein to be not only contradictory to their expansive actions in this case but also something of an abdication of their duty:<br/><br/>"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform." Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice "'never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'" United States v. Raines, 362<br/>U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113<br/>U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).<br/>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). >><br/><br/>Roberts, by virtue of his lies during CONfirmation by the DEMS who shoved his lying ass thru the process at mach speed, needs to be 'impeached' for being a fucking liar. He specifically stated he would not go this route of writing decisions not based on settled, non controversial concepts of the U.S. Constitution…and here clearly he has done exactly the opposite of that.<br/><br/>The real blame should be on the shoulders of the cocksuckers in the SENATE that confirmed the son of a bitch in the first place, stating they wouldn't vote against his confirmation because they were saving their ammo for REAL THREATS TO US..<br/><br/>I blame the fucking DINOCRATS more than I blame this lying pile of shit named Roberts. Pricks like SCHUMER and that other asshole from Illinois, and that lying zionist bastard Levin from Michigan. Just a couple of them holding their ground could have stopped the confirmation of Alito, and then Roberts. But they let it slide.<br/><br/>the assertion that all of this is indeed window dressing is a correct one, and the truth is, though blatantly a violation of our rights across the board, these scum in the SCOTUS are only post fact, asserting the screwing they were doing to us for a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>the truth is, it never mattered what we thought was going on, because Corporations have been functioning well outside the law for a long time now, and nobody has held them accountable. the very bastards that sit on the SCOTUS are benefactors of the wrongdoing and greed of the corporations who provide kickbacks to them for their decisions, in the form of STOCK DIVIDENDS.<br/><br/>unfortunately, focusing on the corrupt SCOTUS doesn't help us much. It's like stating the obvious, and expecting it to be punishable, when it is not.<br/><br/>we are fucked no matter how we look at it, but there will be a day of atonement. Once they take away every last vestige of personal dignity of the entire middle class in this country, there will be hell to pay. There will be a violent, bloody backlash the likes of which has only been seen in France, but eventually will come home to roost here.<br/><br/>Communists have long been in the business of fomenting class war along economic lines and brackets. Try to think more in terms of the Constitutionalist Class than the "middle class" as their linguists prefer. Works better, imo, to throw them off their gameplans.<br/><br/>what is happening now is a quickening in the realization by the Sheeple that something is seriously wrong, and that the facade and the illusion are wearing thin and falling down, revealing the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy push for more power and absolute rule.<br/><br/>as the 'middle class' or whatever you want to call it, gets increasingly decimated and destroyed, ultimately enough Sheeple will have awakened to the point where they realize it's either stand up and fight or die on all fours.<br/><br/>the system ROTHSCHILDS is collapsing in on itself, due to way too much out of control, unchecked GREED, and now, it's like a tall building going back and forth like a pendulum in an earthquake, at some point it will finally 'snap' and fall. we're in the end game, as you will, of democracy and the faux economic system that was being perpetrated upon everyone, so there's a collision with REALITY about to happen pretty soon, and it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>IF I were SCOTUS, I'd be making sure those biz jets are fueled, pilots standing by, for their final PARAGUAYAN trip to the Bush compound where they'll hide once the balloon finally goes up here.<br/><br/>but increasingly, it looks like they're pushing hard for World War III to take everyone's eyes off the mind blowing, incredible HUBRIS of their ilk.<br/><br/>a day of reckoning is indeed coming. And it will not be pretty.<br/><br/>Comment by what I think is happening now is this.. &#124;<br/>February 2, 2010<br/>&#124; Reply<br/><br/>I agree that the collapsing systems are theirs, not America's, and check out this link from Rense.com:<br/><br/>Looks kinda like the ugly, multi tentacled ROTHSCHILD beast behind the corporatocracy is trying to disguise itself as an offshore oil rig or something, doesn't it?<br/><br/>In their push for WWIII, they're also pushing for an insurrection here to throw out the Constitution in exasperation and contempt so that they can replace it with their own designs. Sounds like Treason to me.<br/><br/>In my own idea and understanding there have to be restrictions on what constitutes speech to prevent a bastardization of the term and an overly liberal interpretation of the First Amendment..Great post!!<br/><br/>4 We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413<br/>U. S., at 615. >><br/><br/>The US went bankrupt when FDR called in the gold. We had no more gold to pay for the paper we borrowed from the FED. It is now in a yearly bankruptcy rollover. The government is now private like BLACKWATER. All government agencies are listed on DUNN AND BRADSTREET. The common law which the constitution specifies pertains to natural people. All business by the courts today is corporate meaning that we are viewed as individual corporations. We exist by contract with the state. Remember the 14th amendment. There were no US citizens before that. Most of us have unwittingly claimed US corporate citizenship. We need to address the rule by the banking elite.Almost all leading REPS and DEMS are members of the COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS or the TLC. LOok up the history of who started and controls these. Rush, Glenn and Sean are all liars and banker bootlickers. Obama is a puppet for the CFR. 911 truth has a great deal more bearing and would serve to unite the honest people in this country.<br/><br/>I don't really believe I'm a corporation or the citizen of one but, if the gubbermint thinks so, does the SCOTUS ruling mean that there are no more campaign contribution limits on anyone, businesses or individuals? I'd rather see money removed from our electoral process altogether — equal time on America's airwaves given at no charge for all candidates | ΑΛΗΘΩΣ<br/><br/>Ní daoine iad corparáidí agus nach bhfuil airgead cainte<br/><br/>I Saoránach Coimisiún Toghcháin an Aontais Eorpaigh, chuir Cúirt Uachtarach na Stát Aontaithe srianta ar chaiteachas corparáideach i dtoghcháin faoi mar gheall ar chearta cainte a chosaint saor in aisce. Dúirt an Breitheamh Anthony M. Kennedy, a scríobh don chuid is mó, "Má tá aon fheidhm ag an gCéad Leasú, cuireann sé cosc ar an gComhdháil ó shaoránaigh a chleamhnú nó a phríosúnú, nó ar chumainn na saoránach, gan ach dul i mbun cainte polaitiúil." Tá an argóint sin ag an gcinneadh seo maidir leis na tuairimí go bhfuil corparáidí clúdaithe ag na cosaintí cainte céanna atá ag saoránaigh aonair saor in aisce agus go bhfuil síntiúis feachtais nó maoiniú mar an gcéanna leis an óráid sin.<br/><br/>Níl corparáidí, áfach, mar an gcéanna le daoine aonair agus dá bhrí sin ní féidir na cosaintí céanna a bheith acu le daoine aonair. Tá roinnt dlíthe ann a chosnaíonn corparáidí agus a leasanna sa réimse ar de réir sainmhínithe, mar atá an margadh. Tá na dlíthe lena rialaítear corparáidí agus na cearta atá á mbaint acu éagsúil ó dhlíthe agus ó chearta daoine aonair. Is féidir le corparáid, mar shampla, dul i mbun conarthaí cosúil le duine, ach murab ionann agus duine, is féidir le baill chorparáide a chosaint le dliteanas teoranta ionas nach bhfuil a sócmhainní pearsanta i gceist.<br/><br/>Más rud é gur eintiteas dlíthiúil ar leith é corparáid atá faoi rialú dlíthe éagsúla ná eintiteas aonair, ní chosnaíonn corparáidí faoin gCéad Leasú ar an gcaoi chéanna a gcosnaítear daoine aonair. Tá tionchar nach beag ag corparáidí, go háirithe ina gclaonadh is cumhachtaí agus is saibhre, ar fhormhór na ndaoine i Meiriceá. Bhí sé i gceist ag na srianta ar chaiteachas corparáideach i dtoghcháin a chuir Cúirt Uachtarach na Stát Aontaithe ar ceal an chothromaíocht cumhachta seo idir an meán daoine aonair agus gnólachtaí a bhfuil tionchar míchuí acu a shásamh. Tá raidhse bealaí ag corparáidí cheana féin chun tionchar a imirt ar pholaitíocht, ó choistí gníomhaíochta polaitiúla go brústocairí ar Capitol Hill. Bhí frámaí an Bhille um Chearta ag iarraidh guthanna an mhionaithe a chosaint, gan guthanna an mionlach a mhéadú.<br/><br/>Is é an chuid eile d’áitreabh na Cúirte Uachtaraí lena cinneadh ná go mbaineann an clásal urlabhra saor in aisce leis an maoiniú feachtas. Cé gur féidir an óráid a léiriú go scaoilte mar aon chineál léirithe, chruthódh sainmhíniú chomh hoscailte, chomh mór céanna fadhbanna le gach cineál dlíthe. Tá fís d’fhoirgneamh ag ailtire: is é a chuid ealaíne, a léiriú féin, ach ní féidir leis neamhaird a dhéanamh ar dhlíthe na dtíortha ina bhfuil rialú áitiúil, mar shampla, srian a chur ar airde a chuid foirgnimh. Dá mba rud é go gcuireann sé srian ar an stát maidir le sárú a chuid cainte saor in aisce, a cheart chun a chur in iúl? Airgead a chothromú le urlabhra osclaíonn sé an doras freisin chun éilimh ghlóthacha a dhéanamh, mar shampla, fostóir a chuireann in aghaidh dlíthe pá íosta ós rud é gur mhaith leis a chur in iúl nach fiú a chuid fostaithe ach $ 3 uair an chloig a íoc. Ní mór srianta a bheith ann maidir leis an méid atá i gceist le hómós a chosc i leith an téarma agus ní mór léirmhíniú foriomlán liobrálacha a bheith ann ar an gCéad Leasú.<br/><br/>Tá sé de chumhacht ag corparáid cheana ráiteas a eisiúint i bhfabhar iarrthóir nó beartas trína choistí gníomhaíochta polaitiúla, agus tá fáilte roimh bhaill aonair gnó airgead a chur leis freisin. Mar sin féin, rud a ligeann do chorparáide a chuid brabúis ollmhóra a úsáid chun an toghchán a mhaoiniú go díreach nó chun iarrthóir a bhaint, cuireann sé isteach ar an gcoincheap daonlathach toghchán saor agus cothrom. Tá ceangail neamhchosúil leis seo fiú idir polaiteoirí agus tionscail éagsúla, ach dhéanfadh an rialú nua seo naisc den sórt sin níos láidre agus thabharfadh sé veinír dlisteanacht dóibh. Dhéanfadh polaiteoirí a mhaoineodh gnó a bheannacht iomlán dá chlár oibre polaitiúil agus ní do na vótálaithe.<br/><br/>Ní hamháin go bhfuil neamhspleáchas na bpolaiteoirí i gceist, ach chomh maith le neamhspleáchas ár mbreithiúnais, a bhfuiltear ag súil leo ar a laghad a bheith neamhchlaonta. Baineann go leor stát úsáid as toghcháin fós chun breithiúna a cheapadh, rud a fhágann go bhfuil siad leochaileach ó thionchar an chaiteachais pholaitiúil. In óráid ag comhdháil scoile dlí, d'éirigh an t-iar-Bhreitheamh Sandra O'Connor buartha faoi thionchar mhaoiniú feachtais chorparáidigh i dtoghcháin bhreithiúnach, ag rá go bhfuil "cógáil breithiúnach a dhéanamh ar chinneadh na seachtaine seo caite i leith breithiúnas neamhspleách a choimeád."<br/><br/>Tá dhá bhunchloch dár ndaonlathas – toghcháin saor in aisce agus Breithiúnas neamhspleách — faoi bhagairt ag gníomhaíocht na Cúirte Uachtaraí agus ag an gcinneadh maidir le samhaltú. D'fhéadfaí an cás a chinneadh i bhfad níos caolaí i bhfabhar na Saoránach Aontaithe, ach ina ionad sin, chinn an chuid is mó de na breithiúna an cás a leathnú chun cur leis na cearta airgid mór thar leas na ndaoine Meiriceánacha. Thug na Seanadóirí Dick Duirinn (D-IL) agus Arlen Specter (D-PA) isteach an tAcht um Thoghacháin Aonach Anois Márta seo caite. Chuirfeadh sé toirmeasc ar ranníocaíochtaí ó choistí gníomhaíochta polaitiúla agus chuirfeadh sé síntiúis aonair, atá teoranta do $ 100, ar bhonn 4:1, ionas go ndíreodh an t-éileamh ar na daoine. Tá córas den sórt sin i bhfeidhm i gCathair Nua-Eabhrac ó Acht Airgeadais Feachtais 1988.Tá an chuid eile den tír thar a bheith maith le leanúint. Ná ní raibh gá riamh leis an gcomhrac ar son maoiniú poiblí.<br/><br/>Is iníon sóisearach Coláiste Columbia í an t-údar san eolaíocht pholaitiúil. Is mac léinn ionchasacha dlí í.<br/><br/>Níor dhaingnigh na Stáit an 14ú leasú, a bhí ar cheann de na leasuithe a cuireadh leis an Atógáil tar éis Cogadh na nAisimirce Thuaidh riamh agus tá níos mó fadhbanna aige ná na leasuithe eile ar an iarchogaidh a cuireadh le chéile. Má fhreastalaíonn mo chuimhne ceart, dhearbhaigh an Chúirt Uachtarach gurbh iad na corparáidí 14ú saoránach Cleasaithe le linn na 1800í déanach nó go luath sna 1900idí. I gcás nach bhfuil tú eolach ar fhoclaíocht an leasaithe seo, rinne sé, go bunúsach, saoránach (agus ábhar) de na Stáit Aontaithe. Roimh an gCogadh, bhí gach duine ina saoránaigh den Stát ina raibh cónaí orthu agus ní raibh aon duine ina shaoránach de na Stáit Aontaithe ná ní raibh siad faoi réir dlínse na Stát Aontaithe ach amháin dóibh siúd a raibh cónaí orthu i gCeantar Columbia nó a raibh cónaí orthu laistigh de cheann de na críocha faoi dhlínse na Stát Aontaithe. Ba é príomhchuspóirí Chogadh na nIascach Thuaidh ná ceannasacht na Stát aonair a scriosadh agus stádas gach Meiriceánach do stádas ábhair faoi rialú agus faoi dhlínse rialtas na Stát Aontaithe a laghdú. Bhunaigh na haithreacha bunaidh ár rialtas mar chomhdháil scaoilte na Stát Sóivéadacha leis na Stáit a fheidhmíonn an chumhacht pholaitiúil bhríoch uile. Níor thug siad riamh cuireadh ná níor theastaigh uathu riamh aon chumhacht éifeachtach pholaitiúil a bheith acu le cónaí i Washington. Ní bheidh rudaí i bhfad níos measa ach go dtí go mbeidh na daoine a chaitheamh ar an thieves agus airgead athruithe amach as Washington agus ar ais ar ár rialtas ar an méid a bhí sé aon uair amháin.<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn an focal duine corparáid sa dlí. Ní hé sin nach daoine, is é sin nach corparáidí daoine.Tá muid ag iarraidh aitheantas corparáideach a ghlacadh [GACH CAPS]. Féach ar do cheadúnas tiománaithe. Gach uair a théann muid chun na cúirte, téann muid mar chorparáide, ní mar dhuine nádúrtha.Ba iad na chéad chorparáidí ná rialtais.D'fhéach siad go loighciúil, dliteanas teoranta do chorparáide, is é leathnú díolúine ceannasach chuig an rí tar éis a bhí sé a thuilleadh rí. Tá na teaghlaigh mionlach rialaithe céanna fós i gceannas agus téann sé sin go léir ar an mbealach ar ais go dtí an chéad eolas faoi eachtardhomhanda[ananaki] a labhraíonn doiciméid an Iarthair faoi. Glacann an grúpa céanna an creidmheas nó an locht ar na reiligiúin agus na sochaithe rúnda go léir freisin.<br/><br/>Cén difríocht a dhéanann sé? I ndáiríre. Smaoinigh air, is iad an Comhdháil agus an Seanad ar fad ná seó madra agus chapaillíní, na bróicéirí chumhacht fíor a rialaíonn sé go léir sna scáthanna, ag obair na ndéileálann, ag déanamh cad is mian leo, leis an AL-CIA-DA agus MOSSD amach ann ag marú gach duine a n-aontaíonn leis na assholes rialtas scáth atá á reáchtáil go fírinneach é go léir.<br/><br/>Mar sin, cén fáth a bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach anois a bheith trína chéile thar an cac seo? Cén fáth anois? Tar éis níos mó ná dhá chéad bliain de chruthúnas iomlán nach bhfuil sna polaiteoirí ach seó puipéad lámh mhaisiúil chun muid a mhealladh ón RÍOCHT DHÉANAMH AGUS A DHÉANAMH AR AN RÍOBHÁIDEACHA in áiteanna eile, cén fáth a bhfuil ábhar ann anois go bhfuil díspeacracht iomlán an daonlathais á léiriú ag SOCUS leis an rialú seo? Na assholes ar an gcúirt seo tá a fhios nach bhfuil na guys fíor lena lámha ar na luamháin chumhacht an chórais sa Chomhdháil agus an Seanad.<br/><br/>Nuair a tháinig an Riail an Dlí OBSOLETE ar fud an domhain, go ginearálta, agus gach rud a tháinig níos mó nó níos lú ROLLable ach an uair seo, ar STERIDS, do agus ag an CORPORATIONS, cén fáth go raibh a dhéanamh ar an rialú aonair go léir go bhfuil difríocht i bhfad? Cén fáth a gceapann tú go bhfuil an táscaire ‘gafaing’ seo ar fad de dheireadh aon mhílamhlacha rialtais dhaonlathach difear ar bith.<br/><br/>Ar ndóigh, bí cinnte nach raibh an rialú seo a tharla. An gceapann aon duine agaibh nach leanfadh na corparáidí agus na tionchair ar airgeadaithe sna scáthanna ag baint leo go léir agus ar a gcuid thoil ar an gcuid eile againn?<br/><br/>Dóibh siúd agaibh a cheapann gur mhaith leo a bheith difriúil, mhol mé duit leigheas a fháil ar do TÍORTHA!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Ní raibh an rialú a dhéanamh ar cheann iota de difríocht. Bhí sé i gcónaí mar seo, i bhfad sular dúirt SCOTS go bunúsach le corparáidí; "dul ar aghaidh, a dhéanamh ar cad ba mhaith leat a fuck... nach bhfuil na daoine beag ach fodar gunna do do chogaí, chattel chun tú a bertier agus a dhíol ar do fóillíochta."<br/><br/>Bhí an daonlathas ina illusion i gcónaí.Ní raibh aon smacht againn riamh, riamh. a leithéid de sliabh amach as an cnoc caochÚn atá go hiomlán gan údar, i bhfianaise go bhfuil do stair iomlán 230 bliain na poblacht seo, na cait saille agus na oligars saibhir riamh gá aon Chomhdháil nó Seanad a dhéanamh ar an méid áthas siad, faoi imthosca ar bith, riamh.

Dá bhrí sin, tá na cearta céanna ag aon ghnó leis na daoine sin (seachas, ar ndóigh, an ceart chun vótáil, atá in áirithe do na daoine aonair féin).An tsaoirse chun saibhreas duine a dhiúscairt de réir mar a fheiceann sé oiriúnach chomh maith leis an tsaoirse chun é a thuilleamh. Má tá airgead tuillte ag comhiomláin daoine aonair, ba cheart go mbeadh sé saor in aisce cinneadh a dhéanamh maidir le conas an t-airgead sin a dhiúscairt. Ní hé an fhadhb fíor gur féidir le gnóthais feachtais a bhronnadh, is é sin go bhfuil cead ag an rialtas meddle a dhéanamh i ngnó – is é sin gur féidir leis an rialtas roinnt bhfabhar a thabhairt ar ais ar an airgead sin.

| Interpretive Summary: This book chapter reviews various aspects of what is needed for the selection of model weeds to answer questions pertinent to weed science. Specifically, the chapter covers why we need model species, attributes of model species, and provides the current state of knowledge and resources that have been developed for a few key weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome that may make them good potential models.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Selection of a limited number of model weeds and development of genomic-based tools and resources will facilitate studies on the ecology, biology, physiology and development of weedy species. Such studies will help answer fundamental questions of concern to weed scientists. However, to ensure the weed science community can appropriately and fully utilize these model weeds, they will need to be carefully selected. Various attributes such as ease of study, weedy characteristics, and importance as a weedy species will need to be considered. Additionally, the availability of existing genomic resources can be used to extend the list of viable model weeds. Several resources have also been developed specifically for weeds such as leafy spurge, Canada thistle, waterhemp, and purple false brome. | Achoimre léirmhínitheach: Déanann an chaibidil leabhar seo athbhreithniú ar ghnéithe éagsúla den mhéid atá ag teastáil chun fiailí múnla a roghnú chun ceisteanna a bhaineann le heolaíocht fiailí a fhreagairt.
