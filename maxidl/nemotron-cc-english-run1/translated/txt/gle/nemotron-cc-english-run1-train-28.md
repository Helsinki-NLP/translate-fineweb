| There is a well known quote by Plato who once said: "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy, but most importantly music for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.<br/><br/>Whatever your religion or culture music will always play and important part. It often defines what is essentially unique about a particular group of people and helps to create a sense of community. Dr Shinichi Suzuki describes his teaching this way: 'Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. Along with improving self-esteem and self-expression their are also benefits that include increasing memory and is believed that learning music can boost academic achievement. Although the exact mechanics of this is often not understood, the belief is that learning music stimulates parts of the brain that then have a carry-over impact on all academic areas.<br/><br/>Research indicates that the brain of a musician, even a young one works differently than that of a non-musician. In the field of Neuroscience research has shown that a larger proportion of neural pathways are used in learning music as the brain has to work harder.<br/><br/>There is a link between this and improved spacial-temporal skills that help in solving multistep problems such as in the fields of maths, engineering and the arts.<br/><br/>It also provides structure and focus which may benefit other areas of learning. As well as bringing, structure, organisation and discipline which carries over into other areas of your childs life we must not forget the most important fact about learning music. It brings enjoyment and a sense of fun. | Tá luachan maith ar eolas ag Plato a dúirt uair amháin: "Ba mhaith liom ceol, fisic agus fealsúnacht leanaí a mhúineadh, ach is tábhachtaí ceoil do na patrúin sa cheol agus is iad na healaíona go léir na heochracha le foghlaim.<br/><br/>Cibé an mbeidh do chreideamh nó do cheol cultúrtha ag súgradh i gcónaí agus mar chuid thábhachtach de, is minic a shainíonn sé an rud atá uathúil go bunúsach faoi ghrúpa daoine áirithe agus cabhraíonn sé le mothú pobail a chruthú. Déanann an Dr Shinichi Suzuki cur síos ar a theagasc ar an mbealach seo: 'nach é an ceol teagasc mo príomhchuspóir. Ba mhaith liom saoránaigh mhaith a dhéanamh. Má chloiseann páiste ceol breá ó lá a bhreith agus má fhoghlaimíonn sé chun é féin a imirt, forbraíonn sé íogaireacht, smacht agus seasmhacht. Faigheann sé croí álainn. Chomh maith le féinmheas a fheabhsú agus buntáistí a féin-léiriú a chuimsíonn cuimhne a mhéadú agus a chreidtear gur féidir le ceol foghlama cur le gnóthachtáil acadúil. Cé nach dtuigtear go minic faoi mheicnic bheacht seo, is é an creideamh go spreagann foghlaim ceoil codanna den inchinn a bhfuil tionchar acu ar gach réimse acadúil ansin.<br/><br/>Léiríonn taighde go n-oibríonn inchinn ceoltóir, fiú duine óg ar bhealach difriúil ná sin de neamh-cheoltóir. I réimse an taighde Néareolaíochta tá sé léirithe go n-úsáidtear sciar níos mó de chosáin nádúrtha chun ceol a fhoghlaim mar go gcaithfidh an inchinn oibriú níos deacra.<br/><br/>Tá nasc ann idir an nasc seo agus tá feabhas ar scileanna spásúla a chabhraíonn le fadhbanna ilmhéadrach a réiteach, mar shampla i réimsí na matamaitice, na hinnealtóireachta agus na n-ealaíon.<br/><br/>Soláthraíonn sé struchtúr agus fócas freisin a d'fhéadfadh leas a bhaint as réimsí eile foghlama. Chomh maith le tógáil, struchtúr, eagrú agus smacht a chuireann isteach i réimsí eile de do shaol leanbh, ní mór dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh ar an bhfíric is tábhachtaí faoi cheol foghlama. |

| Breaking out of the Box Fay Tsitou investigates moving objects in British museums<br/><br/>Objects are the main 'protagonists' in two different fields: museums and puppetry. In both cases, the objects enable us to interact with our surroundings, our past, and our inner self.<br/><br/>Museum visitors perceive a vast majority of the museum objects from a distance, while these remain mainly static and mute in or outside the galleries' showcases. On the other hand, puppet theatre audiences join the world of moving objects/puppets that are often literally given a voice (sound or speech). Nevertheless, is there a common ground of static and moving objects worth exploring in these contexts?<br/><br/>Museum Puppetry Research<br/><br/>Museum puppetry adopts the language of puppetry within museum exhibitions. It aims at investigating the interaction among museum visitors, objects' stories, exhibits' histories and exhibitions' narratives. It examines how object-centred activities discretely disguise their visitor-centred identity while they enable visitors to free their mind and heart from possible inhibitions or preconceptions. Museum puppetry is a type of museum learning activity, similar to and often combined with museum theatre. However, as G.B. Shaw might say, 'the actor in his primitive form' (i.e. the puppet) unblocks the audiences' imagination which '…plays a far greater part than the exertions of the actors'.<br/><br/>Museum puppetry examples in UK<br/><br/>There are a number of variables that characterise a museum puppetry activity, such as the type of museum, the type of puppetry, the target group, the activity area in the museum, the degree of interaction among the four units (participants, exhibits/collections, puppets, practitioners), the use of verbal and/or object language. For instance, one type of activity could be a complete show around a museum's performing object, as for example in the Keswick museum in Cumbria where Ali Mc Caw presented a wayang kulit style performance, The Musical Stonemason. The show combined shadow and table-top puppetry with a gamelan orchestra which incorporated a museum object, the musical stone of Skiddaw. Moreover, shows can be related to an exhibit's narrative. For example Professor Geoff Felix's popular Punch and Judy street puppet theatre show was presented in the garden of the Geoffrey Museum and at the Museum of London as part of the Victoria Street exhibit (It is no surprise to learn that Felix's beautifully crafted booth was once mistaken for an exhibit as it was standing in an open area at the same museum!)<br/><br/>Other examples include:<br/><br/>A workshop on puppet construction and manipulation - like the skilfully structured workshop that follows Anna Ingleby's shadow puppetry shows<br/><br/>A puppet workshop based on the museum's handling collection - as this happens at the Horniman Museum (London) to acquaint primary school students with the various types of puppets<br/><br/>A puppet exhibit - like the automata or the dinosaur animatronics in the Natural History Museum in London<br/><br/>Creative learning processes with the use of everyday objects - as these are facilitated by Hedsor Creative Learning, to enhance museum interpretation in places such as Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust and Manchester City Art Gallery<br/><br/>A museum tour with the puppet as a storyteller/facilitator - like Vivien Mousdell's palaeontologist Dr. Ambrose in her puppet show Fossils Alive<br/><br/>An outreach programme - like Jill Webster's interactive puppet show Pirates! All Hands on Deck!, commissioned by Glasgow Science Centre<br/><br/>Manipulation of puppets that belong to original collections is considered par excellence a museum puppetry case - as John Mc Cormick performed with the Victorian Marionettes at the Museum Theatre in London.<br/><br/>The following cases further illuminate the multifaceted potential of performing objects in museums.<br/><br/>'Authentic' metaphors<br/><br/>For twenty-five years adult museum visitors have been enjoying Robert Poulter's New Model Theatre shows in conjunction with special exhibitions and collections, in numerous European and US museums. During Poulter's sophisticated toy theatre shows, paper figures travel smoothly in time and space while interacting with each other and their stage environment. Backdrops are changing continuously. The audience perceives the world represented on stage neither as something static, nor fragmented, but fluidly constructed moment by moment. Although puppetry favours mythological and fictional stories, Poulter makes use of his talent in painting and research skills to interpret selectively historical evidence via flat figures and settings that move vertically and horizontally. The elaborate, live montage evolves as fast and as easy, as the turning of a page. For example, during the art history show Mr Turner Gets Steamed Up, action moves instantly from Margate to London, or from the view out of Turner's window onto the canvas of his famous paintings. The liberties taken with the spoken and visual narrative are noted in detail on the program of the show, allowing Poulter's beautifully crafted paper figures to stand bravely as ultimate 'authentic' metaphors on a miniature stage of History.<br/><br/>Multi-sensory experience<br/><br/>Real coffee beans, shells and cloves cover small wooden boats which sail in a Museum of Docklands' performance originally devised for visitors with the most complex educational needs. The boats' cargo can be smelled and felt as they (metaphorically) travel over the sea to London's Victorian docks in a storytelling piece entitled Over the Sea to London, devised by Emily Capstick and Alison Hale (Peoplescape Theatre). Peoplescape have been creating participatory performances in community, education and museum settings for twelve years. Taking advantage of applied theatre techniques, live music and puppetry's rich potential and flexibility, Capstick and Hale replace verbal description of the past with live action in the present. They create a multi-sensory engaging experience for an audience in-role role with the use of puppets and manipulated objects, without relying on verbal communication.<br/><br/>Popular art<br/><br/>Last year, Dr Matthew Isaac Cohen, as a dhalang shadow puppeteer performed his Ramayana in four parts with the Southbank Gamelan Players at the British Library, where an exhibition under the same title explored how the Indian epic story is retold over the centuries. Similarly to a presentation to an Indonesian audience (who enjoy a great deal of freedom in watching the popular story – spectators can move around, take a nap, leave the show and return!), the Library's audience could watch the nearly three-hour performance seated on pillows or circulating around it. During the show, the spectators could also either move towards the exhibition area to enjoy a museum experience while still hearing the superb chanting and music, or they could go behind the screen and the performers to have a drink while still enjoying the delightful puppet show from the back, viewed through a door opening. While standing in the middle, the wayang kulit Indonesian type of shadow puppetry created an intimate in-between space bridging two worlds: art and life.<br/><br/>Two remarkable cases outside UK<br/><br/>In 2002, a Brooklyn-based constructor/puppeteer, Chris Green, was commissioned to create a part of Noah's Ark exhibit in the Skirball Cultural Center in LA. His sophisticated kinetic or fully manipulated installations – interactive exhibits and puppets manipulated by the museum staff – were made of recycled materials and today attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The Noah's Ark exhibit received awards of excellence from the American Association of Museums and Themed Entertainment Association.<br/><br/>In 2001, the renowned French director Philippe Philippe Genty presented Le Concert Incroyable in the Grande Salle de l' Evolution in the Natural History Museum of Paris. High technology projections of inventive graphic designs were used and interacted with the central exhibit of the gallery: a march that consisted of large mummified animals. This puppet and physical theatre show was a composition of mesmerising images, dramatic action and chorus singing; a unique experience for an adult audience.<br/><br/>So, as we can see museum puppetry embraces a far broader spectrum of practice than might at first be thought! To perceive museums as just another sort of venue, and museum puppetry as a merely a medium suitable to attract preschoolers with their families during Christmas period, is limiting. Recognising the performing objects' potential and communicative power, some museums support their use for their activities and learning programmes year-round.<br/><br/>In fact, these are the museums that foster a close relation between the two inanimate 'soul brothers': museum exhibits and performing objects. In the hands of the experts, such interactions give an extra meaning to an old mystery: '…Inanimate objects / have you then a soul / That clings to our soul / and forces it to love?...' (Alphonse Lamartine, Milly ou la terre natale, 1822)<br/><br/>George Bernard Shaw quotation is taken from his introduction to Max Von Boehn's Puppets and Automata (Dover Publications. New York, 1972, trans. Josephine Nicoll) | Ag briseadh amach as an Bosca Fay Tsitou imscrúdaíonn sé rudaí atá ag gluaiseacht i músaeim na Breataine<br/><br/>Is iad na rudaí na ‘protagonists’ is mó in dhá réimse éagsúla: músaeim agus puipéad.Sa dá chás, cuireann na rudaí ar ár gcumas idirghníomhú lenár dtimpeallacht, ár am atá caite, agus ár gcuid féin istigh.<br/><br/>Breathnaítear ar fhormhór mór rudaí an mhúsaeim ó fad, agus is iad seo den chuid is mó statach agus balbh i taispeántais na ngailearaithe nó lasmuigh díobh. Ar an láimh eile, téann lucht féachana amharclainne puipéad isteach i saol na réad/na bpeipéid atá ag gluaiseacht a thugtar go minic guth (fuaim nó óráid). Mar sin féin, tá talamh coiteann de rudaí statacha agus ag gluaiseacht ar fiú iad a iniúchadh sna comhthéacsanna seo?<br/><br/>Taighde puipéid an Mhúsaeim<br/><br/>Glacann puipéid an Mhúsaeim teanga na puipéad laistigh de thaispeántais músaeim.Tá sé mar aidhm aige imscrúdú a dhéanamh ar idirghníomhaíocht i measc cuairteoirí músaeim, scéalta rudaí, stair na dtaispeántas agus scéalta na dtaispeántas. Scrúdaítear ann an chaoi a bpléann gníomhaíochtaí dírithe ar réad go discréideach a n-aitheantas le haghaidh cuairteoirí agus cuireann siad ar chumas cuairteoirí a n-intinn agus a gcroí a fháil saor ó choscanna nó réamhthuairimí a d’fhéadfadh a bheith ann. Is cineál gníomhaíochta foghlama músaeim é puipéadlann, cosúil le amharclann an mhúsaeim agus go minic in éineacht leo. Mar sin féin, mar a d’fhéadfadh G.B. Shaw a rá, d’fhéadfadh 'an t-aisteoir a bhfuil a fhoirm primitive aige' (i.e. an puipéad) díghlasálann sé samhlaíocht an lucht féachana a 'tá i bhfad níos mó i gceist leis ná mar a thugann na haisteoirí'.<br/><br/>Samplaí d'fhigiúirí an Mhúsaeim sa Ríocht Aontaithe<br/><br/>Tá roinnt athróg ann a bhaineann le gníomhaíocht phríonta músaeim, mar an cineál músaeim, an spriocghrúpa, an limistéar gníomhaíochta sa mhúsaem, an méid idirghníomhaíochta i measc na gceithre aonad (rannpháirtithe, foilseáin/bailiúcháin, puipéid, cleachtóirí), úsáid teanga ó bhéal agus/nó réad. Mar shampla, d’fhéadfadh gníomhaíocht amháin a bheith ina seó iomlán timpeall ar chuspóir léirithe mhúsaeim, mar shampla i músaem Keswick i gCumbria áit a chuir Ali Mc Caw i láthair feidhmíocht stíl chuilt bealaigh, The Music Stonemason. An seó le chéile scáth agus puipéad barr tábla le ceol gála a ionchorprú rud músaem, cloch ceoil Skidaw. Thairis sin, is féidir seónna a bheith bainteach le scéal taispeántais.

Gach Lámh ar Deic!, coimisiúnaithe ag Ionad Eolaíochta Ghlaschú<br/><br/>Meastar go bhfuil ionramháil puipéid a bhaineann le bailiúcháin bhunaidh mar dhea-shampla de chás puipéid an mhúsaeim - mar a rinne John McCormick leis an Maoricéid Victeoiriach ag Amharclann an Mhúsaeim i Londain.<br/><br/>Cuireann na cásanna seo a leanas le chéile tuilleadh cumais ilghnéitheacha ar rudaí a dhéanamh i músaeim.<br/><br/>meitéareolaithe ‘Auntic’<br/><br/>Le cúig bliana is fiche de chuairteoirí músaeim do dhaoine fásta ag baint suilt as seónna Amharclannaíochta Múnla Nua Robert Poulter i gcomhar le taispeántais agus bailiúcháin speisialta, i go leor músaeim Eorpacha agus SAM. Le linn seónna amharclainne sofaisticiúla bréagán Poulter, taisteal figiúirí páipéir go réidh in am agus spás agus iad ag idirghníomhú lena chéile agus a dtimpeallacht stáitse. Braitheann an lucht féachana nach bhfuil ionadaíocht ag an domhan ar an stáitse mar rud éigin statach, ná bheith ilroinnte, ach a tógadh go scamallach tráth faoi láthair. Cé go bhfuil scéalta miotasacha agus fictional i bhfabhar puipéad, baineann Pulter úsáid as a chuid buanna i péintéireacht agus scileanna taighde a léirmhíniú go roghnach fianaise stairiúil via figiúirí cothrom agus suímh a bogadh go hingearach agus go cothrománach. Forbraíonn an móiminteam ilchasta, beo chomh tapa agus chomh héasca le casadh leathanaigh. Mar shampla, le linn stair na healaíne taispeánann an tUasal Turner Faigheann steamed, bogann gníomh láithreach ó Margate go Londain, nó ón amharc amach as fuinneog Turner ar chanbhás na bpictiúr cáiliúil atá aige. Tugtar faoi deara go mion na saoirsí a tógadh leis an insint labhartha agus amhairc ar chlár an tseó, rud a ligeann do figiúirí páipéir álainn Poulter seasamh go cróga mar ‘autontic’ deiridh ar chéim miniature Stair.<br/><br/>Taithí ilchéadfach<br/><br/>Clúdaíonn pónairí caife, sliogáin agus clúdaigh báid bheaga adhmaid a sheol i Músaem Dugas ar dtús do chuairteoirí leis na riachtanais oideachais is casta.

Almost 20 years later, the challenge of ensuring women's rights remains.<br/><br/>On May 30, the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda released its report, which contains a standalone goal on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. In addition, the illustrative health goal contains a target on ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.<br/><br/>Gender equality and ensuring universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential ingredients for sustainable development. We must maintain the momentum gained on these issues in the high-level panel through to the final deliberations at the UN General Assembly in 2014 on global goals for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Now more than ever, we need to recognise the centrality of gender equality. Now more than ever, we must end gender inequality as the grand objective of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Promoting gender equality in the post-2015 agenda includes finishing the work that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) started. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal mortality and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. There is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality severely constrains women's independence and freedom, control over their own bodies, sexuality and childbearing, and restricts their life choices and opportunities in terms of education and work. There is also abundant evidence that it significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality - such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalised through crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty discrimination. Therefore, tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies.<br/><br/>Achieving gender equality - including women's rights, women's health and women's empowerment - is not only a means to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development, it is an important end in itself.<br/><br/>Landmark documents such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have long established that women's rights are human rights. CEDAW, established in 1979 and ratified by almost every country in the world, places responsibility for ensuring equal rights for men and women with the state. Women must be offered the same access to all aspects of life as men in order to reach equal status.<br/><br/>We have not achieved this yet. Therefore, we are recommending that the UN General Assembly consider effectively tackling this challenge, and the unfinished business of the MDGs, by ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health are at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, with relevant goals, targets and indicators approved.<br/><br/>This proposal has strong support among a wide range of stakeholders and development actors, including many governments, multilateral agencies and civil society organisations. The respective national, regional and global thematic consultations on health, inequalities and education in the post-2015 agenda, as well as the Rio+20 outcome document's framework for action and follow-up, have all stressed the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment.<br/><br/>The MDGs created an unprecedented mobilisation of political will and resources in recent years, not least around MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing maternal and infant death. Both of these goals are inextricably linked to gender equality and the rights, health and empowerment of women and girls. It is essential for our common efforts regarding these to be carried over and further strengthened in the post-2015 agenda. Including goals on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 agenda will highlight, once again, the central role of women's rights as human rights. The panel report has given a strong momentum for these issues - now it is up to all of us global actors to maintain it, and make sure that it survives all the way to 2015.<br/><br/>We are at a decisive point in our common history when our policy intentions and actions will shape the future of human development and our planet in the face of both unprecedented achievements and persistent challenges. Let us ensure that the post-2015 agenda is truly universal and inclusive, and that the ultimate goal is a world where all - men, women, young people and children - are treated as equally worthy lens is suitable for general macro work but if you want greater subject-to-lens distance a 100mm lens will give you this at a price.

| How Mobile Games Can Help Improve Sanitation<br/><br/>More than 2.5 billion people, many of them in Africa and South Asia, face grave sanitation challenges. In many of these countries, people are more likely to own a cell phone than a toilet. Therefore there is an obvious opportunity to use mobile technology to promote the use of sanitation and good hygiene in order to make a substantial impact. Mobile phones in Kenya transfer money; Bangladeshis listen to English language classes on their phones; and in Ghana, women entrepreneurs use mobiles to market their wares.<br/><br/>The growing Games for Change industry applies principles of traditional social games to address specific challenges . For example, in the UK, Channel 4 commissioned the game developer Playniac to build an online game to improve financial literacy among the 50% of young Britons who are heavily in debt. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, young developers have built iPhone, Android, and Javascript games based on local storylines. Pledge 51, a Nigerian developer group, recently released Danfo, a game where the user plays as a bus driver coping with dense Nigerian traffic.<br/><br/>Hattery Labs has begun to explore how games might improve sanitation practices. The typical game-players in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are young urban males who own smartphones, but many of the communities that face the greatest sanitation challenges have less advanced technology. However, Javascript games built for Nokia S40 phones (among the most popular handsets in the developing world) provide an opportunity to send a compelling message on good behavior practices in sanitation and hygiene. A full report on how games can promote good sanitation and behavior practice is HERE.<br/><br/>Here are a few game ideas that might prove effective:<br/><br/>Soap Wars makes hand-washing an entertaining challenge where players use the soap dispenser as a weapon against dangerous germs. Sanitation Heroes engages players in the process of sanitation maintenance from capturing, transporting, and disposing of feces to reusing it as fertilizer. It features different scenarios in a memory game that prompts the player to match the solution to each different stage of capturing and treating waste.<br/><br/>Toilet Hunt introduces obstacles along the course of finding a safe place to go to the bathroom. As the player searches for sanitary latrines on a basic map, they must use the clues to decide whether the latrine is safe.<br/><br/>There are outstanding questions that the current research hasn't resolved:<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to illiterate players, who need rich visual descriptions and narratives to guide the gameplay? The need for rich imagery does not necessarily match the small, low-resolution screens of Nokia S40 phones.<br/><br/>How does the game appeal to women, who are critical participants in sanitation but don't represent the largest percentage of mobile game players? One initial idea is to frame sanitation storylines as mobile 'comic books', allowing users to scroll through an interesting narrative with subtle sanitation and hygiene messages.<br/><br/>How can the lessons from the game translate to rural areas, where there are fewer who can access it and more who face the challenges that it seeks to mitigate? Urban users might take their phone with them to their home village and share it with their friends and family, who will begin playing the game and continue to play out the game's storyline in real life.<br/><br/>Finally, how can the game measure its impact on sanitation behavior? User adoption and engagement in this context is a false metric to evaluate impact since users might play the game but have their behavior unchanged. Any solution to measure impact should combine a mobile game with other digital and non-digital applications that help users track their sanitation use alongside their game success. Local developers can work in partnership with games for change experts, community organizations, and telecommunications companies to test these approaches.<br/><br/>This report explores the potential of using mobile games to engage citizens in addressing persistent community challenges but we want to hear from you. Is this an effective way to engage target populations? Are there other ideas for how games can impact behavior change? Would you play these games | Conas Is Féidir le Cluichí Soghluaiste Cabhrú le Sláintíocht a Fheabhsú<br/><br/>Tá dúshláin mhóra ann san Afraic agus san Áise Theas.

Úsáideann fóin phóca in airgead aistrithe Chéinia; An Bhanglaidéis éisteacht le ranganna Béarla ar a bhfóin; agus i nGána, úsáideann fiontraithe mná fóin phóca chun a gcuid earraí a mhargú.<br/><br/>Na Cluichí do thionscal na n-athruithe i bhfeidhm prionsabail na cluichí sóisialta traidisiúnta chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar dhúshláin ar leith.

In the northern part of this range, they occur in shallow water (less than 18 m) while in the southern portion, they are found in water deeper than 55 m.<br/><br/>The offshore fishery occurs on Georges Bank off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. Depending on the area, scallop fishing can be conducted on a year-round basis.<br/><br/>Sei Whale: (Balaenoptera borealis)<br/><br/>Too big to fit in one photo<br/><br/>14 meters; 13 tons.<br/><br/>The sei whale is often confused with the larger blue and fin whales. Its blow is similar to that of a fin whale, but lower and the sei's dorsal fin is more hooked.<br/><br/>The sei shows little of itself when surfacing, although it may poke its head out of the water, it only arches its back slightly and does not show its flukes before quietly submerging. The sei whale is all one slate gray color on top and may be lighter gray underneath.<br/><br/>Look for several blows in succession as the sei lays on the surface resting between its dives. It may be seen in groups of two to five off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Shrimp (Pandalus borealis )<br/><br/>The little guy<br/><br/>During the 1990s, carapace length statistics of northern shrimp decreased in commercial and survey catches off Newfoundland and Labrador. Decreased growth rates caused by decreases in per-capita food availability due to large population increases, exacerbated by increased metabolic demands from higher water temperatures in the mid-1990s, appear to be the main cause of the size decrease. Fishing could have had an accelerating effect on environmentally driven decreases in shrimp growth and size by 'cropping' the largest shrimp from the population. The greatest decreases in shrimp size occurred in Hudson Strait and the adjacent northern shelf, the area which also has the highest densities and largest shrimp.<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver Hake<br/><br/>Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis)<br/><br/>Silver hake are members of the cod family, but are more slender and have two dorsal fins. They are dark gray with silver underparts. When freshly taken from the water, they are silvery iridescent, but the bright colour soon fades. Fish in the catch range from 20 to 30 cm in length and weigh between 0.1 and 0.3 kg.<br/><br/>Occurring from the Grand Banks to South Carolina, silver hake are mainly found on Georges Bank and on the Nova Scotia Banks, particularly on Browns Bank and the Sable Island Banks in depths of 55 to 275 m. Silver hake are generally found in the warmer waters of the Canadian Atlantic (7 to 10° C).<br/><br/>Formerly under-utilized in the Canadian fisheries and harvested mainly by fleets of other nations, silver hake were fished almost exclusively by Canadians using otter trawls in the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Silver Hake is sold in Baltimore as Lake Trout.<br/><br/>Skate (Raja senta) [smooth] (Raja radiata) [thorny]<br/><br/>An unpopular sea creature<br/><br/>The analysis of data for the St. Pierre Bank, which is to the south of Newfoundland, shows the average number of barndoor skate fell from about 0.6 million in the 1950s to fewer than 500 in the 1970s Meanwhile, smaller skate species, namely the horny skate and the smooth skate increased in biomass during the same interval. No barndoor skate have been caught on the St. Pierre Bank since the 1970s.<br/><br/>Smelt (Osmerus mordax)<br/><br/>Tiny Fish for Japan<br/><br/>Native to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the spring the sexually mature ripe smelt will leave either the sea or large lakes and travel up streams to spawn. In Newfoundland this can occur when the ice is still on many of the lakes. However, usually this occurs in March, April or May. The precise time depending on latitude and temperature, usually 8.90C is optimal.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the precise time of spawning is quite specific to the individual stream.<br/><br/>Spawning may last up to three weeks, but the peak seldom lasts more than a week. Spawning takes place at night with spawners returning to the lake or ocean by day . The length of both sexes will decrease in size as the period for spawning progresses. Two males will align themselves on either side of a ripe female. The female releases her eggs in clusters, with the milk of both males being released simultaneously. Eggs become adhesive shortly after extrusion, and attach to bottom gravel.<br/><br/>Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio)<br/><br/>Snow Crab<br/><br/>Snow crabs are common in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, around Cape Breton Island and in the bays of Newfoundland, from Fortune Bay to White Bay. They are also found near Hamilton Bank off Labrador.<br/><br/>Snow crabs live most commonly on muddy or sand-mud bottoms at temperatures ranging from -0.5 to 4.5°C. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, they are usually found at depths of 70 to 140 m, while in Cape Breton the depth varies from 45 to 245 m, and 170 to 380 m off Newfoundland. The distribution of small crabs is not well documented but they are occasionally found with the adults, or on gravelly bottoms at shallower depths. In some areas, there are indications that snow crabs move from gravel bottom to mud bottom, usually in deeper waters, as they reach maturity.<br/><br/>Sowerby's Beaked Whale (Mesopolodon bidens)<br/><br/>Where's the sexy lifeguard?<br/><br/>5 meters; 1.5 tons<br/><br/>It is also known as the north sea beaked whale, a rare whale of which little is known. It is thought to be mid-ocean whale which occasionally strays inshore feeding on squid and cod<br/><br/>The majority of whale strandings in the Western north Atlantic have occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Sowerby's is slate gray on the dorsal side and lighter gray on the ventral region. In adult males two teeth are often seen about one third of the way back on the beak erupted outside the mouth. The beak is around 50 cm long. One onlooker said the head looks like a thermos.<br/><br/>Sperm Whale: (Physeter catadon)<br/><br/>No jokes, please.<br/><br/>13 meters; 28 tons<br/><br/>The largest of the toothed whales is often referred to as "Moby Dick." Located at the front of its head, the single blowhole sends a slanted 5-meter misty spray out 45 degrees from its body. Its massive square head and the series of bumps that replace its dorsal fin easily identify the sperm whale It is slate gray. Sperm whales, like the humpback, will throw their tails high into the air when diving.<br/><br/>They are found offshore hunting for squid in deep water, but occasionally can be seen inshore singly or in small groups. | Tá teaghlach mór (300 speiceas) de éisc thuaidh bheaga ina gcónaí ar an mbun in uiscí mara agus úr araon.Cé go bhfuil siad le fáil go príomha in uiscí éadomhain, tarlaíonn roinnt speiceas i dhoimhneacht go 1280 m.
