So an abundant and essential source of energy that would be used in space for the space colony would be solar radiation by developing satellite solar power stations. To live in space, humans must be protected from the fierce intensity and penetrating wavelengths of unattenuated sunlight, but this same energy is one of the primary resources of space. The colony will have to have enough energy to maintain a fairly uniform temperature even though it is apace. The sun shines twenty-four hours a day and is not dimmed by an atmosphere. Shaded materials not exposed to direct sunlight will almost be at absolute zero. While the temperature in closed bodies exposed to the sun can soar above the boiling point. The colony will need to have both heaters and air conditioners. On the other hand, this sun's energy can be converted into electricity in the colonies. It will be converted with ten percent efficiency to electrical power which is sold at a rate of .012 kw/hr, a square kilometre of space would return more than $14,000,000 each year. Converting solar power to electricity in space, we would build satellite solar power stations that would intercept the sunlight and convert it into electricity. The satellite solar power stations would intercept enough sunlight to replace five nuclear reactors or coal plants. The stations could be as big as nine miles long and four miles wide and it would only weigh twenty thousand tons. It would be built with hollow triangular girders made of aluminum that is very fast and easy to build . Solar power satellites are a pollution free way to generate electricity and cost no more than coal or nuclear energy. There has been twomajor designed stations made so far. One is designed by Peter Glaser of Autho … | Businessbooksumarview.com<br/><br/>Maireachtáil sa Spás: Fuinneamh<br/><br/>Tá an spás líonta le fuinneamh radanta agus níos faide ná atmaisféar an domhain an sreabhadh fuinnimh seo níos seasta agus níos déine ón ngrian ná an méid a théann i bhfeidhm ar dhromchla an Domhain.

Chun cónaí sa spás, ní mór daoine a chosaint ó déine fíochmhar agus tonnfhaid dul isteach i solas na gréine neamhsháithithe, ach tá an fuinneamh céanna seo ar cheann de phríomhacmhainní spáis.

| With the role of the media being crucial<br/><br/>With the role of the media being crucial in the promotion of development the Tonga also sought to curtail the media blackout by establishing a community radio station. In 2007 they established the Tonga on air. It was meant to cater for the Tonga who had not been receiving coverage from the state media. The establishment of the radio station was a move aimed at providing the Tonga with access to information and giving Tonga arts and culture exposure. Mudimba points out to the significance of the radio station basing on the fact that the Tonga did not have any radio or television signal for years and that the establishment of Tonga on air would give the BaTonga community the chance to be informed as well as the chance to reach out to the general populace.<br/>The establishment of the radio at Sinazongwe was aided by a team of Austrian radio activists was primarily aimed at improving communication and access to information in the marginalised remote area. The station was at Sinanzongwe Basic School and had the capacity to cover a radius of 20 kilometres reaching out to approximately 10000 people and was meant to serve the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi<br/>For a marginalised community like the Tonga a community radio station can be used as a means for articulation and self-representation which not only helps in strengthening self-consciousness , identity , and culture but it is also an apparatus of communication which contributes to the emancipation and autonomy of a people in a region dominated by political crisis and gives impulse to a vivid public discourse on culture , society and politics. In that way a community radio station will is broad promoter of public discourse.. it facilitates for equal medial participation as it is open to more democratic and self-organised as it is open to the community. The Tonga on air project has also facilitated for the re-joining of families which were once separated by the construction of the Kariba dam. A community radio station also influences change in media policy as it forwards. The radio station also helped in bridging the information gap. It also offers educational programmes in Tonga thus it is very audible to the targeted community<br/>Establishment of a Community Museum<br/>Also as a way of promoting and developing Tonga language and culture the BaTonga also established a community museum at Binga centre. The museum has played a significant role in revitalising Tonga language and culture. BaTonga Museum (2012) the museum known as BaTonga Museum was established in 2000 with the help as a concerted effort between the Tonga community and MS Zimbabwe a Danish non-governmental organisatiion.as highlighted above in community ladened with stereotypes and misconceptions which have led to the near extinction of Tonga language and culture the museum serves as a platform to rewrite the history of the Tonga through the various programmes it carries out. BaTonga Museum (2002) the main objective of the museum is to demystify Tonga culture and create awareness about the Tonga locally, nationally and internationally.it also seeks to rebuild self-esteem and dignity amongst the Tonga. Furthermore besides promoting and preserving Tonga language and cultural material the museum also works in support of the livelihoods of Tonga artists by buying artefacts for display in the gallery. Since ones culture is also conveyed through arts the museum has played a very significant role in this respect. The museum also hosts a number of cultural events which are e With the above objectives in mind the establishment of BaTonga Museum by the Tonga community can be deemed a good developmental initiative as it helps to promote the recognition of the Tonga people. According to Chikozho the curator of the museum the museum has made a major contribution towards the restoration of the Tonga social fabric. He attributes his assertion to the role the museum has played in Binga district and in Zimbabwe at large. The museum has acted as a source of information to both the Tonga and the general populace. By taking responsibility of buying Tonga cultural material the museum has both supported Tonga livelihoods and the promotion and preservation of Tonga culture. Previously Tonga artefacts were being sold on the informal market and exported out of the country at low costs and were sold at very huge prices and in some instances they would be given alien names which meant that the Tonga were being exploited. Such a scenario did not do the Tonga good thus the museum's role in protecting Tonga cultural material is a way of promoting development amongst the Tonga through promoting their culture. The museum is also a resource centre as everyone whom wishes to learn about Tonga culture is referred to it in as far as Tonga history and culture is concerned.<br/><br/>The Introduction ICT amongst The Tonga<br/>The Tonga through the help of donors has also made efforts to promote access to modern technology by introducing ICT to the Tonga community. They launched the Tonga Online project in 2001. The establishment of the project was facilitated by the Kunzwana Trust which worked with the Austrian Zimbabwean friendship association. Since its launch the Tonga online project has primarily focused on promoting a Tonga voice over the internet. The projects objectives are to provide the Tonga access to the worlds most advanced communication tools which will enable them to represent themselves to the outside world and reflect upon the social, political and economic environment of both the global village in which the Tonga live.<br/>The project derives its name mulonga from the Zambezi River. The name reflects the history and aspirations of the Tonga people. The name constantly revokes memories of how the Tonga were displaced to make way for the construction of the Kariba dam which has seen them becoming a marginalised group in Zimbabwe. Even well after their relocation the Tonga are being passed by huge commercial benefits from tourism and electricity that are being extracted from their former habitat which was transformed into a vast expanse of water known as the Kariba dam . The Tonga Online project seeks to establish and expand communication technology with and amongst the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi by joining them in with information communication technology. A number of school based information technology centres have been established in Binga district have been established in Binga district namely at Binga High School and at Manjolo and these have catered for the larger Tonga community with more schools being earmarked for the project<br/>Access to information has become a great question of political rights hence the importance of the Tonga Online project as a tool to spearhead awareness continuity empowerment and local development amongst the Tonga people. The educational significance of the Tonga online project is very significant especially for those in a remote part of the country like Binga where there are no institutions of higher learning<br/>The project also reflects the digital divide and other uneven developments; in the global village. These gaps and imbalances are not only a question of access to resources but also to have the capacity to use these modern day communication tools. In a world where access to information has become a universal human right the Tonga online project tends to support higher levels of human development<br/>The use of the global village has created a platform of for the Tonga to promote their culture through the internet. Currently the internet is one of the most convenient modes of communication and the Tonga Online project is a platform that can be used to give the Tonga a voice on the internet. It has been used as a platform by the Tonga to interact with other cultures hence it has been a medium of cultural exchange thus promoting the recognition of the Tonga<br/><br/>We Will Write a Custom Essay Specifically For You For Only $13.90/page! | Leis an ról atá ag na meáin ríthábhachtach<br/><br/>Leis an ról a bhí ag na meáin ríthábhachtach i gcur chun cinn na forbartha, rinne Tonga iarracht aithris a dhéanamh ar an gcúlra meán trí stáisiún raidió pobail a bhunú. Sa bhliain 2007 bhunaigh siad an Tonga ar aer. Bhí sé i gceist freastal ar an Tonga nach raibh ag fáil clúdach ó na meáin stáit. Bhí bunú an stáisiúin raidió dírithe ar rochtain a thabhairt don Tonga agus tabhairt nochtadh ealaíon agus cultúir dóibh. Léiríonn Midmba go bhfuil tábhacht an stáisiúin raidió atá bunaithe ar an bhfíric nach raibh aon chomhartha raidió nó teilifíse ag an Tonga le blianta agus go mbeadh bunú Tonga in aer an deis a bheith ar an eolas chomh maith leis an deis chun teacht amach chuig an bpobal i gcoitinne.<br/>Chabhraigh foireann gníomhaithe raidió na hOstaire go príomha le bunú an raidió ag Sinoangwe chun cumarsáid agus rochtain ar fhaisnéis a fheabhsú i gceantar iargúlta imeallaithe. Bhí an stáisiún i Scoil Basic Sinozonwe agus bhí sé de chumas aige ga de 20 ciliméadar a chlúdach a bhain amach le thart ar 10000 duine agus bhí sé i gceist aige freastal ar an Tonga ar an dá thaobh den Zamozii<br/>Maidir le pobal imeallaithe cosúil le stáisiún raidió pobail Tonga, is féidir é a úsáid mar bhealach chun iad a chur in iúl agus féin-ionadaíocht a chabhraíonn ní hamháin le féin-chomhfhiosach, féiniúlacht agus cultúr a neartú ach is gaireas cumarsáide é freisin a chuireann le feabhsú agus neamhspleáchas daoine i réigiún atá faoi cheannas géarchéime polaitiúla agus a thugann impulse do phlé poiblí beoga ar chultúr, ar an tsochaí agus ar an bpolaitíocht. Ar an mbealach sin, cuirfidh stáisiún raidió pobail níos mó de phlé poiblí ar fáil. éascaíonn sé le rannpháirtíocht chomhionann sna meáin toisc go bhfuil sé oscailte don phobal ó thaobh an daonlathais agus na féin-eagraithe de. D’éascaigh an Tonga an tionscadal aer d’athcheangal teaghlaigh a bhí scartha óna chéile nuair a tógadh dhamba Kariba, stáisiún raidió pobail i mbeartas na meán mar a chuirtear ar aghaidh é. Ina theannta sin, chuidigh an stáisiún raidió leis an mbearna faisnéise a líonadh, cuireann sé cláir oideachais ar fáil in Tonga, rud a fhágann go bhfuil sé an-chloitiúil don phobal spriocdhírithe.<br/>Músaem Pobail a bhunú<br/>Chomh maith leis sin, mar bhealach chun teanga agus cultúr Tonga a chur chun cinn agus a fhorbairt, bhunaigh an Bataga músaem pobail in ionad Bingo. Bhí ról suntasach ag an músaem maidir le teanga agus cultúr a athbheochan. Bhunaigh Músaem Ba Tonga na Músaem (2012) an músaem ar a dtugtar Músaem Ba Tonga sa bhliain 2000 leis an iarracht chomhbheartaithe idir pobal Tonga agus MS An tSiombáib eagraíocht neamhrialtasach sa Danmhairg. Chomh maith leis sin leag sé béim ar thuas i bpobail le steiréitíopaí agus míthuiscintí a d’eascair as an teanga agus an cultúr in aice le teanga agus cultúr Tonga mar ardán chun stair an Tonga a athscríobh trí na cláir éagsúla a fheidhmíonn sé. Is é príomhsprioc an mhúsaeim ná cultúr Tonga a dhíchumadh agus feasacht a chruthú ar an Tonga go háitiúil, go náisiúnta agus go hidirnáisiúnta. Chomh maith le teanga agus ábhar cultúrtha a chur chun cinn agus a chaomhnú, oibríonn an músaem freisin chun tacú le slí bheatha ealaíontóirí Tonga trí dhéantáin a cheannach lena taispeáint sa ghailearaí. Ó tharla go gcuirtear cultúr na ndaoine in iúl trí ealaíona an mhúsaeim, bhí ról an-suntasach ag an músaem maidir leis seo. Tá roinnt imeachtaí cultúrtha ar siúl sa mhúsaem chomh maith agus tá na cuspóirí thuas á gcur in iúl gur féidir le pobal Tonga a bheith ina dea-thionscnamh forbraíochta mar a chabhraíonn sé chun aitheantas mhuintir Tonga a chur chun cinn. De réir Chiozho rinne coimeádaí an mhúsaeim cur go mór le hathchóiriú fhabraic shóisialta Tonga. Cháin sé a dhearbhuithe go dtí an ról a bhí ag an músaem i gceantar Bingo agus sa tSiombáib i gcoitinne. Is foinse faisnéise é an músaem don Tóca agus don phobal i gcoitinne araon. De bharr an fhreagracht a ghlacadh as ábhar cultúrtha Tonga a cheannach tá tacaíocht tugtha ag an músaem do slite beatha Tonga agus cultúr Tonga a chur chun cinn agus a chaomhnú. Roimhe seo Díoladh déantáin Tonga ar an margadh neamhfhoirmiúil agus onnmhairíodh iad as an tír ar chostas íseal agus díoladh iad ar phraghsanna an-mhór agus i gcásanna áirithe thabharfaí ainmneacha eachtrannach dóibh a chiallódh go raibh an Tonga á n-úsáid. Ní raibh a leithéid de chás go maith mar sin is bealach é ról an mhúsaeim maidir le hábhar cultúrtha Tonga a chosaint i measc na Tonga tríd a gcultúr a chur chun cinn. Is ionad acmhainní é an músaem freisin mar go ndéantar tagairt do gach duine ar mian leo foghlaim faoi chultúr Tonga chomh fada agus a bhaineann le stair agus cultúr Tonga.<br/><br/>An Réamhrá TFC i measc The Tonga<br/>Tá iarrachtaí déanta ag an Tonga trí chabhair deontóirí rochtain ar theicneolaíocht nua-aimseartha a chur chun cinn trí TFC a thabhairt isteach i bpobal Tonga. Sheol siad tionscadal Tonga Ar Líne i 2001. D’éascaigh Iontaobhas Kunzwana bunú an tionscadail a d’oibrigh le comhlachas cairdeas na hOstaire sa tSiombáib.Ó seoladh tionscadal ar líne Tonga atá dírithe go príomha ar ghuth Tonga a chur chun cinn ar an idirlíon. Is iad na cuspóirí tionscadail ná rochtain ar an Tonga a chur ar fáil ar fud an domhain na n-uirlisí cumarsáide is forbartha a chuirfidh ar a gcumas iad féin a léiriú don domhan lasmuigh agus machnamh a dhéanamh ar an timpeallacht shóisialta, pholaitiúil agus eacnamaíoch sa sráidbhaile domhanda ina gcónaíonn Tonga.<br/>Faigheann an tionscadal a ainm mulogna ó Abhainn Zambezi.Léiríonn an t-ainm stair agus mianta mhuintir Tonga. Déanann an t-ainm cuimhní cinn i gcónaí ar an gcaoi ar díláithríodh an Tonga a dhéanamh ar bhealach chun an dam Kariba a thógáil, rud atá le feiceáil go bhfuil siad ina ngrúpa imeallaithe sa tSiombáib. Fiú amháin tar éis a n-athlonnú tá an Tonga á rith ag sochair tráchtála ollmhór ón turasóireacht agus leictreachas a bhaintear as a ngnáthóg roimhe sin a chlaochlú i méid mór uisce ar a dtugtar an Dam Kariba. Féachann tionscadal Tonga Líne a bhunú agus a leathnú teicneolaíocht cumarsáide leis agus i measc an Tonga ar an dá thaobh den Zambezi trí páirt a ghlacadh leo i dteicneolaíocht cumarsáide faisnéise. Tá roinnt ionad teicneolaíochta faisnéise scoilbhunaithe bunaithe i gceantar Bingo mar atá i Bingo High School agus ag Manjolo agus tá siad seo tar éis freastal ar an bpobal níos mó Tonga a bhfuil níos mó scoileanna á gcur in áirithe don tionscadal<br/>Tá rochtain ar fhaisnéis ina cheist mhór faoi chearta polaitiúla agus mar sin tá tábhacht le tionscadal Tonga ar Líne mar uirlis chun cumhacht leanúnachais feasachta agus forbairt áitiúil a scaipeadh i measc mhuintir Tonga.

| Computer Networks – ARP<br/><br/>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure for mapping a dynamic Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a Media Access Control or MAC address.<br/><br/>The job of the ARP is essentially to translate 32-bit addresses to 48-bit addresses and vice-versa. This is necessary because in IP Version 4 (IPv4), the most common level of Internet Protocol (IP) in use today, an IP address is 32-bits long, but MAC addresses are 48-bits long.<br/><br/>ARP works between network layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). The MAC address exists on layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer, while the IP address exists on layer 3, the network layer.<br/><br/>ARP can also be used for IP over other LAN technologies, such as token ring, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and IP over ATM.<br/><br/>In IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses, ARP has been replaced by the Neighbor Discovery protocol.<br/><br/>How ARP works<br/><br/>When a new computer joins a LAN, it is assigned a unique IP address to use for identification and communication. When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular LAN arrives at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a MAC address that matches the IP address. A table called the ARP cache maintains a record of each IP address and its corresponding MAC address.<br/><br/>All operating systems in an IPv4 Ethernet network keep an ARP cache. Every time a host requests a MAC address in order to send a packet to another host in the LAN, it checks its ARP cache to see if the IP to MAC address translation already exists. If it does, then a new ARP request is unnecessary. If the translation does not already exist, then the request for network addresses is sent and ARP is performed.<br/><br/>ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines know they are using that particular IP address. When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.<br/><br/>Host machines that don't know their own IP address can use the Reverse ARP (RARP) protocol for discovery.<br/><br/>An ARP cache size is limited and is periodically cleansed of all entries to free up space; in fact, addresses tend to stay in the cache for only a few minutes. Frequent updates allow other devices in the network to see when a physical host changes their requested IP address. In the cleaning process, unused entries are deleted as well as any unsuccessful attempts to communicate with computers that are not currently powered on.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing and ARP cache poisoning<br/><br/>Any LAN that uses ARP must be wary of ARP spoofing, also referred to as ARP poison routing or ARP cache poisoning. ARP spoofing is a device attack in which a hacker broadcasts false ARP messages over a LAN in order to link an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server within the network. Once a link has been established, the target computer can send frames meant for the original destination to the hacker's computer first as well as any data meant for the legitimate IP address.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing can have serious impacts on enterprises. When used in their simplest form, ARP spoofing attacks can steal sensitive information. However, the attacks can also go beyond this and facilitate other malicious attacks, including: | Líonraí Ríomhaireachta – ARP<br/><br/>Is nós imeachta é Prótacal Réitigh (ARP) chun seoladh Prótacal Idirlín dinimiciúil (seoladh IP) a mhapáil chuig buan-sheoladh meaisín fisiceach i ngréasán ceantair áitiúil (LAN). Tugtar rialú Rochtana nó MAC ar an seoladh meaisín fisiceach freisin.<br/><br/>Is é an jab atá ag an ARP go bunúsach chun seoltaí 32-giotán a aistriú chuig seoltaí 48-giotán agus vice-versa. Tá sé seo riachtanach mar gheall ar IP Leagan 4 (IPv4), an leibhéal is coitianta de Phrótacal Idirlín (IP) atá in úsáid inniu, tá seoladh IP 32-giotán fada, ach tá seoltaí MAC 48-giotán fada.<br/><br/>Oibríonn ARP idir sraitheanna líonra 2 agus 3 den mhúnla Idirnaisc Córais Oscailte (Múnla OSI).Tá an seoladh MAC ann ar chiseal 2 den mhúnla OSI, an ciseal nasc sonraí, agus tá an seoladh IP ar chiseal 3, an ciseal líonra.<br/><br/>Is féidir ARP a úsáid freisin le haghaidh IP thar teicneolaíochtaí LEAN eile, ar nós fáinne comhartha, comhéadan sonraí dháileadh snáithín (FDDI) agus IP thar ATM.<br/><br/>I IPv6, a úsáideann seoltaí 128-giotán, tá ARP curtha in ionad an phrótacail Fionnachtana Chomharsa.<br/><br/>Conas a oibríonn ARP<br/><br/>Nuair a théann ríomhaire nua isteach i LAN, sanntar seoladh uathúil IP é le húsáid le haghaidh aitheantais agus cumarsáide. Nuair a bhíonn paicéad atá ag teacht isteach i gcomhair meaisín óstach ar LAN ag tairseach áirithe, iarrann an geata ar an gclár ARP seoladh MAC a oireann leis an seoladh IP a aimsiú. Coinníonn tábla ar a dtugtar an taisce ARP taifead de gach seoladh IP agus a sheoladh MAC comhfhreagrach.<br/><br/>Gach córas oibriúcháin i líonra IPv4 Ethernet choinneáil ar taisce ARP.Gach uair a iarrann óstach seoladh MAC d'fhonn pacáiste a sheoladh chuig óstach eile san LAN, seiceálann sé a taisce ARP a fheiceáil má tá an IP a seoladh aistriúchán MAC cheana féin. Más rud é go ndéanann sé, ansin níl gá le hiarratas nua ARP.Mura bhfuil an t-aistriúchán ann cheana féin, seoltar an t-iarratas ar sheoltaí líonra agus déantar ARP.<br/><br/>Craolann ARP pacáiste iarraidh ar na meaisíní ar an LAN agus iarrann má tá aon cheann de na meaisíní a fhios agat go bhfuil siad ag baint úsáide as an seoladh IP ar leith. Nuair a aithníonn meaisín an seoladh IP mar féin, seolann sé freagra ionas gur féidir le ARP an taisce a nuashonrú le haghaidh tagartha sa todhchaí agus dul ar aghaidh leis an gcumarsáid.<br/><br/>Is féidir le meaisíní óstach nach bhfuil a seoladh IP féin a úsáid an prótacal Reverse ARP (ARRP) le haghaidh fionnachtana.<br/><br/>Tá méid taisce ARP teoranta agus tá sé glanta go tréimhsiúil ar gach iontráil go spás saor in aisce; i ndáiríre, is gnách nach bhfanann seoltaí ach cúpla nóiméad sa taisce. Ceadaíonn nuashonruithe minic gléasanna eile sa líonra a fheiceáil nuair a a athraíonn óstach fisiciúil a seoladh IP iarrtha. Sa phróiseas glantacháin, scriostar iontrálacha nár úsáideadh chomh maith le haon iarrachtaí nár éirigh leo cumarsáid a dhéanamh le ríomhairí nach bhfuil faoi thiomáint faoi láthair.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing agus ARP nimhiú taisce<br/><br/>Ní mór d'aon LEAN a úsáideann ARP a bheith fainiciúil faoi shleamhnú ARP, dá ngairtear freisin mar ródú nimh ARP nó nimhiú taisce ARP. ionsaí gléas é ARP spoofing ina craoladh hacker teachtaireachtaí ARP bréagach thar LAN d'fhonn nasc a dhéanamh idir an seoladh MAC an ionsaitheoirí agus seoladh IP ríomhaire dlisteanach nó freastalaí laistigh den líonra. Nuair a bheidh nasc bunaithe, is féidir leis an sprioc-ríomhaire frámaí a sheoladh chuig an gceann scríbe bunaidh chuig ríomhaire an hacker ar dtús chomh maith le haon sonraí atá i gceist don seoladh dlisteanach IP.<br/><br/>Nuair a úsáidtear iad san fhoirm is simplí, is féidir le hionsaithe spoofing ERP faisnéis íogair a ghoid. Mar sin féin, is féidir leis na hionsaithe dul níos faide ná seo agus ionsaithe mailíseacha eile a éascú, lena n-áirítear: |
