| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Trí an Bíobla C2000 Series Déanfar muid ag dul go dtí an leabhar na nAchtanna, caibidil amháin, mar a thosaímid ar ár staidéar ar an eaglais luath.<br/>Scríobh Luke, údar leabhar na nAchtanna, compánach de Pól an t-aspal, a bhí ina údar leis an soiscéal de réir Luke, an dá chonradh seo chuig cara, Theophus. Is ainm Gréagach é Theophius. Ciallaíonn an t-ainm leannán Dé. Tá roinnt a chreideann nach fear é ar chor ar bith, ach gur seoladh an soiscéal agus leabhar na nAchtanna do lovers Dé, cibé duine a d’fhéadfá a bheith. Tá traidisiúin eile ann a deir go raibh Theophlus ina mháistir i ndáiríre Luke.Go raibh sclábhaithe ag dochtúra na laethanta sin, de ghnáth daor an phátrúin saibhir. Mar sin, gur Theoifilias a bhí i máistir Luke, agus d’eisigh sé Luke le bheith ar na turais mhisinéara. Dá bhrí sin, tá Lúcás ag scríobh ar ais chuig a iar-mháistir. Is traidisiún luath den eaglais é seo, ach ar ndóigh, ní féidir a chruthú, cosúil leis an oiread sin de na traidisiúin.<br/>Tá freisin iad siúd a chreideann go bhfuil nuair a bhí Paul i Tros agus fuair sé fís de fear ag glaoch ris ag rá, "Téigh go Macadóine agus cabhrú linn," nach raibh an fear i bhfís Phóil aon cheann seachas Luke. Maidir leis an gcéad cheann a bhuail Pól le chéile i ndáiríre nuair a tháinig sé go Macadóine bhí Lúcás agus muid i leabhar na nAchtanna, gheobhaidh tú amach, nuair a shroicheann muid an chuid sin de leabhar na nAchtanna, go mbeidh Lúcás ag scríobh níos mó sa chéad phearsa seachas an tríú duine. Mar sin, is léir, ag an bpointe áirithe seo in Achtanna na nAspal gurbh é Lúcás a bhí ina chompánach ag Pól agus thosaigh sé ag dul ar thuras leis. Thosaigh sé ag úsáid na forainmneacha "muid" agus "muid" in ionad "iad" agus "iad". Níl aon amhras faoi, áit a raibh Luke ina rannpháirtí agus finné ar na rudaí sin a bhí ag tarlú ón bpointe seo. Tabharfaimid é seo amach duit nuair a shroicheann muid an pointe sin.<br/>Tosaíonn sé na hAchtanna de na Apostles trína tying sé leis an Soiscéal De réir Luke Tá sé suimiúil go bhfuil an rud an-mhall ina soiscéal an chéad rud a thaifead sé i na hAchtanna na nAspal. Tá an soiscéal faoi Íosa ag insint a dheisceabail fanacht in Iarúsailéim go dtí go mbeidh siad endured le cumhacht ó ar ard. Agus ansin Íosa ascended suas sa spéir, agus mar sin dhúnann sé an soiscéal.<br/>Is é sin an chéad chonradh [is é sin, an Soiscéal De réir Lúcás,] tar éis dom a bheith scríofa agat, ag O Theophlus, gur thosaigh Íosa ag déanamh agus ag múineadh (Acht 1:1 araon),<br/>Is é an focal is tábhachtaí ná nach scéal iomlán a bheith ag formhór Íosa Críost ná an soiscéal a Dar le Íosa Críost, ach tús a chur leis an aireacht Íosa Críost, leanann Íosa ag an aire a thabhairt do riachtanais na ndaoine. Leanann Íosa ag ardú na marbh. Leanann Íosa lena ghrá agus a soiscéal don domhan, ach anois tá sé ag déanamh aithris air seo trí na deisceabail sin a bhfuiltear tar éis a aithris a dhéanamh lena Spiorad Naomh. Ach tá aireacht Chríost leanúint ar aghaidh; go bunúsach is é an t-áitreabh a thógann Luke sna hAchtanna de na Aspallacha a bhí mar thoradh ar chonradh Íosa go léir a thosaigh, araon a dhéanamh agus a mhúineadh.<br/>Anois mar gheall ar sin, tá na hAchtanna na nAspal leabhar neamhchríochnaithe: sa lá atá inniu go leanann an Tiarna ag obair trí shaol na ndaoine a tiomanta iad féin a bheith ar an ionstraimí Dé. Le bheith i gceannas agus treoraithe agus anointed ag a Spiorad Naomh, chun leanúint ar aghaidh leis an Aireacht Íosa ar fud an domhain lá atá inniu ann., Anois tá Dia ordaigh gur chóir a chuid oibre a chur i gcrích trí ionstraimí daonna., Ní féidir liom a rá go gcaithfidh sé a chur i gcrích. Is féidir le Dia úsáid a bhaint as dhaoine aingeal mar gheall ar a chuid oibre, agus beidh teacht ar am, le linn an leabhar Revelation nuair a bheidh Dia a úsáid aingeal a fhógairt a soiscéal do dhaoine ar fud an domhain. Apacailipsis 14, Caibidil 14, "An chéad aingeal ag eitilt tríd an lár na bhflaitheas a bhfuil an soiscéal síoraí " (Réibh 14:6) Ach i láthair na huaire, roghnaigh Dia uirlisí daonna a úsáid. An rud spreagúil faoi sin é, beidh Dia a úsáid dom agus beidh Dia a úsáid tú., Mar sin, amanna, táimid begging amach, "O Tiarna, ní féidir liom labhairt., Ní raibh mé riamh in ann a labhairt roimh nó fiú anois, a Thiarna." Mar Moses iarracht a impigh amach ar an glaoch Dé. Dúirt Jeremiah, "A Thiarna, tá mé ach a kid; tá duine ar bith ag dul chun éisteacht liom." Agus ní mór dúinn go léir ár excuses cén fáth nach féidir linn a úsáid.<br/>Uair amháin, mar a bhí an Tiarna ag glaoch ar fáidh a dhéanamh a chuid oibre, dúirt sé, "A Thiarna, a sheoladh cibé duine is mian leat." Dúirt an Tiarna, "Dia duit, "A Thiarna, smaoineamh maith; sheoladh cibé duine is mian leat." Mar sin, go minic tá muid sa phost sin, "A Thiarna, a sheoladh ag an lámh duine ar bith a bheidh tú, aon duine ach dom Tiarna." Agus go fóill, tá Dia d'ordaigh a úsáid.<br/>Anois, is féidir le gach duine againn ár neamhfhoirfeachtaí féin a thaispeáint.Is féidir le gach duine againn ár n-éagumas féin a chur in iúl, agus is féidir le gach duine againn leithscéal a fháil cén fáth nach mbeadh Dia ag iarraidh mé a úsáid. Ach fós féin, roghnaigh Dia tú a úsáid. Go tríd do shaol b’fhéidir go nochtfaidh sé é féin do shaol súl. Nuair a bhíonn na huirlisí sin ag Dia le húsáid conas a fuair sé an post riamh, an bhfuil tú?<br/>Go dtí an lá inar tógadh é, ina dhiaidh sin thug sé le fios do na haspail a roghnaigh sé (Acht 1:2):<br/>Sin é a chríochnaigh sé an Soiscéal Lúcáis leis an lá a tógadh Íosa suas, tar éis a dúirt sé na haspail chun fanacht le haghaidh an dearlaisteach na cumhachta.<br/>Chomh maith leis sin léirigh sé [is é sin na haspail freisin] é féin beo dóibh tar éis a phá (nó a bháis) ag go leor cruthúnais dhochloíte (Acht 1:3),<br/>Tá sé deacair a dhiúltú ar an bhfíric ar an aiséirí Íosa Críost, bhí mé ag amazed, chomh maith le annoyed agus irritated, ag airteagal a léamh mé sa Santa Ana Clár seo caite Dé Sathairn. Ar na teoiricí eolaíochta agus réabhlóideacha atá á gcur i láthair sna scoileanna contae, dúirt an tOllamh amháin seo go múineann sé rang eolaíochta, agus dá bhrí sin, go ndéileálann siad ach i bhfíoras, agus nach bhfuil áit ar bith acu do theoiricí. Toisc go bhfuil an eolaíocht bunaithe ar fhíricí agus tá cruthú bunaithe ar piseoga reiligiúnacha.Glacann sé a lán creidimh chun na teoiricí reiligiúnacha a chreidiúint.Nuair a bhíonn tú ag déileáil le fíricí, is féidir leat glacadh leo díreach. Shíl mé, "An-suimiúil sa rang eolaíochta sin, mhúin siad dom go raibh sé ina bhfíric go raibh an domhan ceithre billiún bliain d'aois. Anois, tá siad ag múineadh go bhfuil an domhan dhá bhilliún bliain d'aois. Agus ní raibh sé chomh fada ó shin gur chuaigh mé ar scoil."<br/>Tá sé suimiúil nár ghá go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú nó nuashonrú ar an mBíobla riamh chun na sonraí reatha atá aimsithe ag fir a chomhlíonadh. Agus fós, más rud é go mbeadh tú a chur ar mo chuid téacsleabhair eolaíochta scoile ard lá atá inniu ann agus iarracht a mhúineadh rang eolaíochta uathu, ba mhaith leat a fháil amach go bhfuil go leor de na rudaí a bhí múinte mar fhíric eolaíochta nuair a bhí mé i scoil ard nach bhfuil aitheanta a thuilleadh mar rud eolaíochta. Níl an protoplasm cille simplí a thuilleadh cill simplí, ach thar a bheith casta., Má tá aon rud is féidir a fhianú i stair go bhfuil sé ar an bhfíric ar an aiséirí Íosa Críost ó na marbh.<br/>Tá córas dlínse againn atá bunaithe ar fhianaise finnéithe. Má tá fear cúisithe as coir agus go bhfuil daoine a chonaic an coir sin agus a bhí á dhéanamh, agus go bhfuil siad á dtabhairt chuig an gcaighdeán, agus a mhionnaíonn siad an fhírinne, an fhírinne iomlán a insint, agus rud ar bith ach an fhírinne, mar sin cabhrú leo Dia. Agus ina cheistiú dearbhaigh siad go bhfuil, "a chonaic mé go fear sa bhanc ar an 20ú Bealtaine is fiche -. Chonaic mé é a tharraingt amach gunna as a cóta. Chuala sé go bhfuil an t-airgead go léir a thabhairt dó. Chonaic mé é mar a d'fhág sé an banc. Chonaic mé é mar an t-oifigeach a bhí ag seasamh taobh amuigh." Agus más féidir leat trí nó ceithre fhinné a fháil chun an fear sin a chur in iúl agus coimeádfaidh sé a gcuid fianaise faoi chroscheistiú, meastar go bhfuil an fear sin ciontach. Tá beirt nó triúr finnéithe againn a thugann fianaise ar an scéal céanna faoin bhfear sin, agus glactar leis gurbh é an té a rinne an coir agus atá ciontach. Tá finnéithe agat a chaith an fhírinne curtha in iúl agat atá ag fíorú.<br/>Tar éis bás Íosa, nuair a d'éirigh sé arís, bhí sé le feiceáil ris go leor daoine éagsúla a thug faoi mhionn fianaise gur chonaic siad dó. Agus bhí ar feadh tréimhse daichead lá ar cuairt leo. Agus ag aon am amháin, suas go dtí an oiread agus is cúig chéad duine a bailíodh ag aon áit amháin, bhí sé deacair é a chaitheamh ar leataobh nó a dhiúltú ar an bhfinné de na daoine seo. Is é sin a dhéanamh ná ár gcóras iomlán dlínse a dhíshealbhú. Ach ní amháin sin, na fir a thástáil go bhfuil siad chonaic an Tiarna ardaigh, gur labhair siad leis, go n-íosdaíonn siad le dó, siad, dóibh go léir, cé is moite de amháin, bhuail bás foréigneach ag na lámha daoine eile mar gheall ar a dhearbhú go raibh an scéal siad fíor. Labhraíonn tú faoi fhinnéithe a thaispeántar chun an fhírinne, an fhírinne iomlán, ní dhéanfaidh aon ní ach an fhírinne.Má bhí saol duine faoi bhagairt mar gheall ar an bhfinné sin, agus ba bhréag é, ar a laghad bheadh ceann acu briste faoin mbrú. D’admhaigh siad an hoax iomlán. " Thaispeáin sé dó féin beo tar éis a phaisean ag go leor cruthúnais dhochloíte."<br/>atá le feiceáil acu ar feadh daichead lá, ag labhairt leo faoi na rudaí a bhaineann le ríocht Dé (Acht 1:03):<br/>Uaireanta locht againn ar an deisceabail mar gheall ar a gcuid ceisteanna ar an uainiú an ríocht Dé., Lig sé a mheabhrú go raibh an ríocht Dé an ábhar is fearr leat Íosa Críost. Bhí sé ag caint i gcónaí faoi ríocht Dé, agus tá súil iontach ann go raibh sé ag cur isteach ar chroí gach fear. Ní bhíonn rudaí ag dul i gcónaí chun leanúint ar aghaidh truaillithe mar atá siad. Níl an domhan ag dul go deo faoi chumhacht an dorchadais, faoi ngéibheann olc. Tá Dia ag dul go dtí lá amháin a bhunú a ríocht ar an domhain. Beidh Íosa i réim, áit a dtéann an ghrian amach as a aistir. Agus leathnóidh a ríocht ón gcósta go dtí an chladach.” Agus beidh an lá sin a bheith ar an lá is glórmhar ar fud an domhain le feiceáil riamh, mar breoiteachta agus ag fulaingt agus pian a dhíothú ina ríocht., Mar pheaca agus saint agus na rudaí a rinne an domhan den sórt sin beidh deireadh a chur leis ina ríocht. Tháinig deireadh leis na rudaí seo ina ríocht glórmhar nuair a aontaíonn sé. Ní haon ionadh go raibh na deisceabail imníoch é a fháil. Tá mé imníoch é a fháil; Táim imníoch mar gheall ar a ríocht atá le teacht. Agus dúirt Íosa linn nuair a ghuíonn muid, is é "Thy ríocht teacht, beidh sé déanta sa talamh, mar atá sé ar neamh" ( Mata 6:10).Is é seo an cineál ceart a theastaíonn uainn go léir. Agus mar sin bhí sé ag caint leo, le linn na tréimhse daichead lá seo, ar an ríocht.<br/>Agus, á gcur le chéile acu, d'ordaigh sé dóibh nár chóir dóibh imeacht ó Iarúsailéim, ach fanacht le gealltanas an Athar, a deir sé, gur chuala tú de dom (Acht 1:4).<br/>Dúirt sé, "Féach anois, fanacht anseo in Iarúsailéim go dtí go bhfaigheann tú an gealltanas an Athar." Tá an gealltanas go bhfuil sé ag tagairt do, aon amhras, an gealltanas i Joel nuair a gheall an Tiarna, " Agus beidh sé teacht chun pas a fháil sna laethanta ina dhiaidh sin, deir an Tiarna, go mbeidh mé doirt amach mo Spiorad ar gach flesh; agus do mhic agus iníonacha beidh aisling, beidh do na fir óga a fheiceáil ar na físe: agus ar mo sheirbhísigh agus déanfaidh mo handmaidens doirt amach mo Spiorad, deir an Tiarna 2-28-29. Gealltanas an Athar: tá an lá le teacht nuair a bheidh Dia ag dul a dhoirteadh amach a Spiorad ar gach feoil, gach duine a gheobhaidh siad go dinimiciúil ó Dhia.<br/>Mar a dúirt sé,] baiste go fírinneach le huisce; ach beidh tú a bhaisteadh leis an Spiorad Naomh lá nach leor as seo (Acht 1:5).<br/>Ba é an smaoineamh baisteadh é sin de chuimhne, an baisteadh Eoin le huisce, chuir sé isteach ar na daoine in uisce, "tá tú ag dul a bheith báite sa Spiorad Naomh i laethanta nach leor."<br/>Anois nuair a bhí siad ag teacht le chéile, d'iarr siad air, ag rá, a Thiarna, an mbeidh tú ar ais ag an am seo an ríocht go hIosrael? (Acht 1:6)<br/>Nuair a bheidh sé ag dul a bheith, a Thiarna? Nuair a bheidh an t-am le haghaidh an athchóirithe seo?" Agus Íosa ag caint leo anois, ní mar gheall ar an ríocht, ach mar gheall ar an gcumhacht go bhfuil siad ag dul a fháil le haghaidh seirbhíse., Agus mar sin scuaba ar leataobh a gcuid ceisteanna.<br/>Ag rá ris dóibh, Nach bhfuil sé ar do shon a fhios ag an am nó na séasúir, a bhfuil an tAthair a chur ina chumhacht féin (Acht 1:7).<br/>Ní raibh a fhios agat." Mhair siad i gcónaí ar ionchas an áith a chur ar bun. Le linn shaolré iomlán Íosa, bhí siad ag súil leis ag aon nóiméad chun dul isteach sa mboth teileafóin agus teacht amach mar slánaitheoir an domhain. Shazam! Ag taispeáint a chumhacht agus a bhuachaint ar rialtais an domhain, ag bunú ríocht Dé ar an talamh. Agus bhí siad ag fanacht go laethúil ar an athrú seo a thrasnú. Agus aon uair a bheadh Íosa labhairt faoi ag dul go Iarúsailéim, á iompú ar láimh i lámha an duine sinful, agus ansin á céasadh, "Oh, ní, a Thiarna, aon ní nach dtuigeann tú an ríocht, a Thiarna. Bí chomh fada sin ó Thee." Nuair a fuair Íosa bás ar an gcros, bhí díomá mór orthu go léir.<br/>An dá dheisceabail ar an mbóthar go dtí Emmas, mar sin dúirt Sé. "Dia duit, a chomhaltaí."Cén chaoi a bhfuil tú chomh brónach mar a bhfuil tú ag siúl"? "Cad a chiallaíonn tú? Ní mór duit a bheith ina strainséir timpeall anseo mura bhfuil a fhios agat na rudaí atá ag tarlú le déanaí in Iarúsailéim "Cad iad na rudaí?" Ó, bhí an t-ainm Íosa de Nazareth... óh fear, bhí sé mighty agus cumhachtach., Bhí anointing Dé ar a shaol. Bhí súil againn go raibh sé i dó an seachadadh ar Iosrael, ach cháin siad air... Bhí súil againn anois go bhfuil sé marbh. " Anois Tá sé ag ardú, agus tá sé ag rá, "I cúpla lá, comhaltaí, tá tú ag dul a fháil ar an gealltanas ar an Athair "Ó, cad gealltanas? an bunú an ríocht" a fheiceann tú, bhí sé dlisteanach gur chóir dóibh a iarraidh. "An bhfuil sé seo Tiarna?. An é seo an t-am? An bhfuil tú ag dul a chur ar bun do ríocht anois?" "Níl sé chun tú a fhios ag na hamanna go bhfuil an tAthair ceaptha nó go bhfuil an Athair ar a chumhacht féin. Ach, gheobhaidh tú cumhacht nuair a bheidh an Spiorad Naomh teacht ar tú."<br/>Anois anseo, úsáidtear an epi preposition na Gréige a chur in iúl caidreamh nua go raibh siad a bheith leis an Spiorad Naomh. Sa Soiscéal De réir Eoin, caibidil 14, mar a bhfuil Íosa ann geallann a sheoladh ar an Spiorad Naomh, dúirt sé, "Ní bheidh mé fhágann tú compordach. Beidh mé ag teacht chun tú, agus beidh mé guí an tAthair, agus beidh Sé a sheolann a thabhairt duit ar chompord eile, fiú an Spiorad na Fírinne nach féidir an domhan a fháil mar tá sé cosúil nach bhfuil a fhios aige Eisean, ach tá a fhios agat Eisean le haghaidh Dia dwells leat, agus beidh sé i tú" (Eoin 14:17-18). Deir Íosa go bhfuil tú ag dul chun cumhacht a fháil nuair a thagann an Spiorad Naomh nuair a bheidh siad againn, ach ní litriú siad "en" in ionad "i." caidreamh dhá-fhillte ann i John: Tá sé in éineacht leat, ach tá sé ag dul a bheith ina chónaí i leat. An eipe preposition na Gréige, a aistrítear i dtéacsanna éagsúla ar fud an Tiomna Nua mar "ar" nó "os" nó is maith liom é, "thar maoil".<br/>Sa seachtú caibidil an soiscéal Eoin: "Ar an lá deireanach, an lá mór na féile nuair a sheas Íosa ann ar an teampall Mount agus adeir na daoine, 'Más fear ar bith tart lig dó teacht ris Mise agus deoch: agus a ól, as a inermost beidh a bheith ann gus torrents uisce ina gcónaí. " Dúirt Eoin, "Labhairt an Spioraid Naoimh, nár tugadh dóibh go fóill a chreideann air ba chóir a fháil" (Eoin 7:37-39). Cad a rinne sé labhairt ar an Spiorad? Go mbeadh sé cosúil le torrent uisce ina chónaí ag sileadh amach. Is maith liom, "Nuair a tharchuireann an Spiorad tú," ar tú, nó os a chionn, nó thar maoil uait. Mar sin, an caidreamh trí huaire: Tá sé le leat roimh do chomhshó, Is é an duine a chuireann faoi deara tú a thuiscint go bhfuil tú peacach, Is é an duine a pointí chun Íosa Críost mar go gcuireann sé le saol na bpeacaí, righteous, agus breithiúnas. An nóiméad a osclaíonn tú do shaol agus croí Íosa Críost agus cuireadh a thabhairt dó teacht i, a thagann an Spiorad Naomh agus tosaíonn a indonn tú., Beidh sé a bheith i agat. Tá a fhios agat nach bhfuil tú do chuid féin, tá tú a cheannach le praghas, dá bhrí sin ghlóir Dia i do chorp agus do spiorad a bhfuil A his. Agus tá a fhios agat nach bhfuil sibh go bhfuil do chorp an teampall an Spioraid Naoimh atá i tú? Bí ar meisce le fíon, i gcás ina bhfuil an iomarca, ach a líonadh, nó a bheith sibh á líonadh leis an Spiorad" (1Co 6:19-20, Eifisigh 5:18). Ach anois tá an tríú caidreamh.<br/>Gheobhaidh tú [an duanus] na dinimice, nuair a bheidh an Spiorad Naomh ag teacht [ep] ar tú [nó os a chionn, nó nuair a bhíonn sin thar maoil as tú]: agus beidh sibh finnéithe ris dom (Acht 1:8)<br/>Agus mar sin an dinimic, le bheith ina fhinné d’Íosa Críost.Tá sé suimiúil gurb é an focal finné i Gréigis an focal marty ó áit a bhfaighimid ár mairtíreach focal. Agus i nGréigis a chiallaíonn sé martyr. Tá finné amháin a fhógraíonn ní hamháin cad a chreideann sé, go gcreideann sé, go bhfuil sé cad a chreideann sé, agus go gcreideann sé chomh láidir sin, go bhfaighidh sé bás ar an méid a chreideann sé. Ní féidir leat stop a chur leis. Níl sé eagla go bhfaighidh sé bás ar an méid a chreideann sé.<br/>Cuimhin leat nuair a bhí Paul ar a bhealach ar ais go Iarúsailéim agus Agab a tháinig anuas ó Caesar agus thóg sé Paul ar chailín agus ceangailte féin suas agus a dúirt sé, " Mar sin, is é an fear a bhfuil úinéireacht an chailín a bheith faoi cheangal nuair a fhaigheann sé go Iarúsailéim. " Agus thosaigh cairde Phóil ag caoineadh, ag rá, "Oh, Pól, ná téigh, ná téigh." Agus dúirt sé, "Cad atá i gceist agat leis na deora? An gceapann tú go bhfuil tú ag dul chun mé a chur faoi cheilt dom? An gceapann tú go bhfuil imní orm faoi bheith faoi cheangal agam? Tá mé réidh chun bás. "Tá mé réidh chun bás" Ní raibh a chur chun báis le haghaidh do chreideamh a dhéanann tú martyr; toisc go raibh tú ina mairtíreach, bhí tú a chur chun báis. Mar sin, ní dhearna sé finné a dhéanamh duit, níor chruthaigh sé ach an méid a bhí tú.Dá mba rud é nach raibh tú mar mhádais, níor tháinig tú riamh ar do bhás. Coinnigh ar aghaidh, a ligean ar athrú cúrsa anseo. Sílim go mb’fhéidir go bhfuil botún déanta agam." Ansin deir tú, "Bhuel, ní raibh sé ina mharthanacht.A ghoid capall tú thief capall; cruthaíonn sé ach go raibh tú.Aon duine stealls capall mura bhfuil sé ina thief capall. Mar sin, ghoid sé ní dhéanann tú a thief capall, cruthaíonn sé ach go raibh tú go léir martyred ach cad a bhí tú finné, martus. "Agus beidh tú a bheith finnéithe." Agus nach bhfuil sé suimiúil go raibh an chuid is mó acu martyred? "Witens unto Me."<br/>Bhí an finné le bheith in Iarúsailéim, agus i ngach ceann de Judea (Acht 1:8),<br/>Thosaigh an finné ceart sa bhaile. Níl an áit is deacra, ná é?Tá sé le tosú ar dheis sa bhaile in Iarúsailéim, agus ansin an limistéar timpeall Iarúsailéim, limistéar Judea.Agus ansin bhí sé le leathadh suas sa tSomáil. Agus ansin bhí sé le dul amach sna codanna is forimeallaí den domhan. Agus de réir mar a dhéanaimid staidéar ar leabhar na nAchtanna, feicfimid an dul chun cinn seo. Agus ansin feicfimid conas a thosaigh sé a scaipeadh ar fud Judea.Agus ansin chuaigh Phillip suas sa tSomáil, agus ansin glaodh ar Paul agus Barnabas chun dul isteach sna codanna is forimeallaí den domhan. Agus mar sin tá an finné scaipeadh tríd an annoying agus an cumhacht ag an Spiorad Naomh.<br/>Anois nuair a labhair sé na rudaí seo, agus iad ina shuí, tógadh é; agus fuair scamall é as a radharc (Acht 1:9).<br/>Is é seo an gealltanas deiridh a rinne Íosa chun a dheisceabail. Is é seo, na focail deiridh roimh a n-a theacht. Ar ndóigh, ina dhiaidh sin tháinig sé agus labhair sé le Paul agus le daoine eile, ach roimh a aontachas, is é seo a focal deiridh. Agus ar seo, nuair a bhí sé ag labhairt na rudaí seo, cé go raibh siad ag faire air, Tógadh sé suas agus fuair scamall air as a radharc.<br/>Agus cé go raibh siad ag lorg go seasta i leith na bhflaitheas mar a chuaigh sé suas, féach, bhí beirt fhear a sheas siad i éadaí bán (Acht 1:10);<br/>Glacaimid leis gur haingil iad.<br/>Cé acu a dúirt freisin, Tá fir de chuid na nGaileanaigh, cén fáth a sheasann sibh ag gréisceáil suas ar neamh? Tiocfaidh Íosa, a thógtar uait ar neamh, mar sin tiocfaidh siad chun na bhflaitheas (Acht 1:11)).<br/>Chonaic siad é féin mar a chuaigh suas ar neamh agus beidh sé féuch sé nuair a thagann sé arís. "Behold an Tiarna cometh le deich mílte dá naoimh, chun breithiúnas a thabhairt ar an talamh" (Íosa 1:14-15). Agus ansin, "Unto Eisean a grá dúinn agus thug dó féin dúinn agus a rinne ris ár n-Dia, ríthe agus sagairt a reign le dó ar an talamh, féuch an cometh Tiarna, agus gach súl a fheiceáil dó, agus beidh siad freisin a pollta air caoineadh" Rev 1:5-7. Mar sin, beidh muid ag rá leis an Tiarna go bhfuil sé ag teacht cheana féin, ach bhí sé ina rún ag teacht Mar a bhí sé ach na deisceabail sin go raibh sé ag dul, ach amháin na deisceabail, an Tiarna Finnéithe, a chonaic Eisean a thabhairt ar ais. Ach dúirt Íosa, "Má deir siad ris tú, "Tá sé tagtha i rúnda agus tá imithe isteach i seomra rúnda nach gcreideann sé" (Mata 24:26). Mar sin, caithfidh tú a roghnú, a chreidiúint Íosa nó iad.<br/>"An Íosa céanna a chuirtear ar bun ó tú isteach ar neamh, beidh mar sin teacht ar nós mar atá tú le feiceáil dó dul isteach ar neamh."<br/>Anois, tá véarsa an-suimiúil i II John, véarsa Act 1:7, " I gcás go leor devecipicéir isteach ar fud an domhain a admháil nach bhfuil Íosa Críost teacht i flesh.", Ar an drochuair, tá droch-aistriúchán de na Gréige. Maidir leis an bprionsabal seo, tá sé i láthair an aimsir agus ba chóir é a aistriú "Tá sé ag teacht sa flesh." Iad siúd a bheadh ag diúltú go bhfuil Íosa Críost ag teacht sa flesh. Féach ar do shon féin, go bhfuil muid a chailleadh nach bhfuil na rudaí a bhfuil muid a wrought, ach go bhfaigheann muid luaíocht iomlán., Chun whoever transgresses agus Cloíonn nach bhfuil i fhoirceadal Chríost, nach bhfuil Dia. Sé go gcomhlíonann sa fhoirceadal Chríost, tá sé an tAthair agus an Mac. Agus má thagann aon ris do doras (ar maidin Dé Sathairn) agus a thabhairt nach bhfuil an fhoirceadal, a fháil dó nach bhfuil i do theach, agus ní a chur air dea-by. Maidir leis go tairiscintí dó go bhfuil dea-by Is comrádaí ar a chuid gníomhais olc" (2Jn 1: 7-11). Iarr orthu ceist amháin, "An bhfuil Íosa ag teacht i flesh" Just a iarraidh orthu an cheist sin., Agus más rud é nach bhfuil siad ag rá, ach cuimhneamh ar cad a dúirt Eoin leat agus cad a John leat. "Má tá aon admháil nach bhfuil go bhfuil Íosa Críost ag teacht i flesh" An cuimhin leat nuair a bhí sé leis na deisceabail agus dúirt sé, "Tabhair rud éigin a ithe"? Dúirt sé, "Níl a fhios agat, biotáille Ní hamháin; teagmháil liom. Mar sin, tá an rud céanna Íosa ag teacht arís ar an mbealach céanna a chonaic siad é dul ar neamh., Agus creidim go bhfuil ag teacht go han-luath.<br/>Ansin d'fhill siad ris Iarúsailéim ó na mount ar a dtugtar Olivet, a bhfuil ó Iarúsailéim ar lá a Sabbath turas [thart ar dhá thrian de míle]. Agus nuair a tháinig siad isteach, chuaigh siad isteach i seomra uachtarach, áit a raibh cónaí ar Peter, agus James, agus John, agus Andrew, agus Phillip, agus Thomas, agus Matha, James, agus Simon Zelotes. Agus lean siad seo go léir i gceann de réir urnaí agus phrionsa, leis na mná, agus le máthair Íosa, agus lena dheartháireacha (Acht 1:12-14).<br/>Is é seo an ceann deireanach de mháthair Íosa. Ag an bpointe seo agus ón bpointe seo ar aghaidh, níl a thuilleadh luaite inti in Achtanna na nAspal ná sna hinstitúidí. Níl aon rud luaite sa scrioptúr. Tá sé ciúin.<br/>Bheadh a bhráithre ina thagairt is dócha do James agus do Jude agus do na deartháireacha eile a bhí ina mac le Joseph agus Mary.<br/>An seomra uachtarach - tá roinnt a deir go bhfuil sé mar an seomra uachtarach céanna ina raibh Íosa an Suipéar Deiridh lena dheisceabail Agus fós, tá daoine eile ann a choinníonn chuig an seomra uachtarach seo mar sheomra sa phrionsa teampall áit ar bhuail an séipéal luath. Tóg do rogha.<br/>Agus sna laethanta sin sheas Peadar i measc na ndisciplíní, agus dúirt sé, (bhí an líon a n-ainmneacha le chéile thart ar céad is fiche), caithfidh an Scripture seo a chomhlíonadh, a bhí mar threoir do dhaoine a ghlac Íosa (Acht 1:15-16).<br/>Anseo arís, Peter fós a chuid féin ollmhór céanna., Tá siad ag fanacht i paidir agus go bhfuil siad ag soláthar, agus seasann Peter suas agus a deir, "Felows, tá scripture go bhfuil gotta a chomhlíonadh." Agus tá a fhios agat go bhfuil sé ag dul ar aghaidh, "a ligean ar a fháil ar an gclár ag dul; a ligean ar caitheadh go leor agus a fháil amach cé atá ag dul a ghlacadh Judas áit ", is dóigh liom go raibh Peter arís sa flesh, rud a léiríonn go bhfuil nádúr spreagadh sin a bhí aige. Agus sílim go léiríonn stair na heaglaise sa leabhar seo, tá suim agam tuiscint a fháil ar na scrioptúir, conas go bhfuil sé ag lua ón oiread sin áiteanna sa tSean-Tiomna. Léiríonn Peter tuiscint an-mhór ar na scrioptúir Sean-Tiomna atá pointe ina fhabhar.<br/>Tabhair faoi deara go gcuireann Peter síos ar an Spiorad Naomh na rudaí sin a scríobh Dáimhe. Mar sin, "Gach scrioptúr tugtar inspioráid do Dhia" (2Ti 3:16). Ní cuid de na scrioptúir. Mar gheall, má insíonn tú dom go dtugtar an chuid sin de na scrioptúir de réir inspioráid ó Dhia, ansin caithfidh mé a iarraidh ort, "Cad iad na codanna de réir inspioráid agus cad iad na codanna nach bhfuil de réir inspioráid?" Agus ansin tá tú ag an údarás a insíonn dom cén chuid is féidir liom a chreidiúint agus cén chuid nach féidir liom a chreidiúint., Agus an nóiméad nach bhfuil Dia a thuilleadh an t-údarás ach tá tú an t-údarás, tá mé i dtrioblóid. Beware acu siúd a rá, "Bhuel, ní féidir leat a chreidiúint, gach ceann de na scrioptúir." Agus anseo, Luke i scríbhinn ar cad a bhí Peter rá, dearbhaíonn go raibh David iarbhír an urlabhraí don Spiorad Naomh, ag an béal David, labhair maidir le Juudas.<br/>Bhí sé ar dhuine den bheirt acu, ach anois cheannaigh an fear seo réimse le luach saothair na fiosrúcháin; agus ag titim ina dhiaidh (Acht 1:17-18),<br/>Cheannaigh sé an réimse, tá réimse na potaireachta mar a dhearbhaíonn an chaibidil aonú déag.<br/>agus ag titim headlong, pléasctha sé faoi deara i lár, agus gach ceann dá babhlaí gued amach (Acht 1:18).<br/>Tá siúd a fhaigheann neamhréireacht sa scrioptúr, mar gheall ar i gceann de na soiscéil deirtear linn, nuair a tháinig Iudas ar ais agus nuair a rinne siad iarracht an t-airgead a thabhairt ar ais, agus a dúirt siad, "Hey, tá sé do fhadhb.Ní féidir linn é a ghlacadh." Agus é a chur ar ais sa státchiste teampall. Ansin chaith sé ansin é ar urlár an teampall agus chuaigh sé amach agus chroch sé é féin. Insíonn anseo Peter dúinn gur thit sé headlong agus díreach popped.Agus tá siad siúd a shamhlú neamhréiteach. An-simplí, chuaigh sé suas isteach an crann a chrochadh air féin, ceangailte leis an rópa timpeall a mhuineál agus ceangailte leis an limis agus léim. Agus thit fórsa an titim ceachtar léim an téad nó a cheann, agus thit sé ar síos isteach sa canyon agus díreach mar a dúirt sé anseo.<br/>Bhí sé ar eolas ag na daoine a bhí ina n-áit chónaithe in Iarúsailéim go léir; tá an réimse ar a dtugtar ina dteanga, Aceldama, is é sin le rá, An réimse fola. I gcás go bhfuil sé scríofa i leabhar na Salm, Lig a áit chónaithe a bheith éadóchasach, agus lig d’aon fhear dwell ann: agus, a easpag in iúl eile a ghlacadh (Acht 11: 19-20).<br/>Anois i ndáiríre tá sé ag lua ó dhá Salm éagsúla anseo. Ó PS 69:25, cuireann sé i dteannta Psa 109:8 é. Agus cuireann sé na tairngreachtaí seo le chéile faigheann sé na tairngreachtaí seo maidir le Judas.<br/>Dá bhrí sin, na fir seo (Acht 1:21)<br/>Anois tá an áit a bhfuil siad ag lorg duine le bheith ina haspal in Iarúsailéim. Seo iad na cáilíochtaí atá á lorg acu san am sin.<br/>Dá bhrí sin de na fir a bhfuil i gcuideachta linn an t-am ar fad go bhfuil an Tiarna Íosa nuair i agus amach i measc dúinn (Acht 1:21),<br/>Anois, cuimhin leat go raibh go leor deisceabail, a roghnaigh Íosa deich a bheith ina haspail. Agus ciallaíonn an focal aspail "aon duine a chuirtear amach" Nó roghnaigh dhá cheann a bheith ina haspail, mar sin chuir sé amach an dá cheann déag. Ní mór dúinn ach a haon déag a ghlacadh Judas' áit, ach ní mór dúinn ceann a bhí le linn go léir ó thús le Íosa. "<br/>Ón am ar baisteadh é ag Eoin, go dtí an lá a tógadh uainn, caithfear ceann a ordú le bheith ina fhinné [] ar a aiséirí (Acht 1:2).<br/>Mar sin ba iad seo na riachtanais a bhí á lorg acu. Duine éigin a bhí thart ar an iomlán agus a bhí. Ón am a bhí baisteadh an John ar aghaidh go dtí an t-achtósúnta. Agus duine a chonaic an t-ardú an Tiarna, agus dá bhrí sin a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ina chúis leis an aiséirí, a fianaise ar an bhfíric.<br/>Anois dúirt Paul an t-aspal, níos déanaí agus é ag dearbhú gurbh é an t-aspal, “An bhfaca mé an Críost an t-ardú?” Is léir go raibh sé ar cheann de na riachtanais a bhí aige maidir le haspáil, "An bhfuil a fhios ag duine éigin ann inniu?" Bhuel, níl a fhios agam. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an chiall céanna go raibh siad sa Tiomna Nua. Surely nach bhfuil aon lá atá inniu ann is féidir a iompróidh finné chun an aiséirí mar a rinne siad.<br/>Cheap siad beirt, Joseph ar a dtugtar Barsabas, a sloinne Justus, agus Matthews. Agus guí siad, agus a dúirt tusa, a Thiarna, a bhfuil aithne acu ar chroí gach fear, a thaispeáint ar roghnaigh an bheirt agaibh (Acht 1:23-24),<br/>Is dóigh liom gur minic a dhéanaimid an botún seo maidir le dhá rogha a thabhairt don Tiarna Dia mícheart, dá bhfeiceann tú.Tá seans maith againn é seo a dhéanamh. Ar ndóigh, ba é Paul rogha Dé. Bhí Peter spreagadh, agus léim an gunna dúirt, "Hey, tá muid chun rud éigin a dhéanamh, tá a fhios agat, gotta cabhrú le Dia amach., Tá a fhios agat, tá duine amháin ar iarraidh agus tá muid fuair a líonadh dó i" Agus fós, "Dia, a bhfuil ceann de na dhá dhéanann tú ba mhaith?" Agus a thabhairt Dia an dá roghanna.<br/>Go bhféadfadh sé a bheith mar chuid den aireacht seo agus an t-aspal, as a thit Juudas ag an transgression, a rachadh sé chun a áit féin. Agus mar sin thug siad a gcuid bheart amach (Acht 1:25-26);<br/>An bealach suimiúil ag a bhfuil siad iarracht a chinneadh an toil Dé., A ligean ar caith dísle, a fháil amach cad a bheidh Dia anseo., Tá sé suimiúil dom, na bealaí éagsúla go bhfuil daoine ceaptha a aithint an toil Dé. Anois, sna hamanna Sean-Tiomna bhí bealach suimiúil acu ag teacht go dtí an sagart, a bheadh ag fiosrú an Tiarna dóibh tríd an Urim agus an Thumm, na "soil agus na foirfeachtaí." Tá mé cinnte nach raibh siad na spéaclaí daite a fuair Joseph Smith leis na táibléad Órga; na spéaclaí draíochta, go nuair a chuir tú iad ar, d'fhéadfaí tú a léamh go tobann an scríbhneoireacht hierroglyphic.<br/>Tá siad siúd a rá go raibh an Urim agus Thumm, i ndáiríre, cloch dubh agus bán a bhí caite i pouch ar an cófra an sagart., Bheadh siad guí agus a iarraidh ar an Tiarna ceist ar leith. Cuimhin leat go raibh David ag iarraidh an Tiarna ceisteanna cinnte: "A Thiarna, beidh muid ag dul amach i gcoinne na Palaistíne" An freagra a bhí, "Níl" Mar sin arís, "A Thiarna, beidh muid ag dul amach in aghaidh an tseilgeáin?" Bhí an freagra, "Tá "Nuair a bheidh muid ag dul?" Chuirfeadh siad ceisteanna ar leith, agus d’ordaigh an Tiarna iad tríd an Íom agus tríd an Thummin. Deir siad go ndéanfadh an sagart guí, go n-iarrfadh Dia, agus go sroichfidh sé ceann den dá chloch bhán ansin. Dá mba é an chloch bán é, ba fhreagra sea é. Más rud é nach raibh, ansin bheadh sé ar an chloch dubh go mbeadh sé tarraingt amach. Roinnt fiú a rá linn a fháil ar an téarma blackmailed ón Urim agus Thumbe.I ndáiríre, ar ais sa bunaidh tá sé aon vóta i gcoinne tionscadal nó smaoineamh ar leith. Ach le linn na tréimhse Sean-Tiomna, d’úsáid siad modh réitigh go leor chun toil Dé a chinneadh.<br/>Mar sin, anseo tá na deisceabail ag piocadh suas ar an rud céanna mar a bhfuil siad ag caitheamh an dísle a fheiceáil cé acu de na dhá chomhalta a roghnaigh Dia a chur in ionad Iudas Iscarriot.<br/>thit an crannchur ar Mattias; bhí sé uimhriú leis an aonú déag (Acht 1:26).<br/>Anois cé hé Mattias ar fud an domhain? Níor chuala duine ar bith é riamh roimh nó ó shin.Beidh sé suimiúil bualadh le Mattias agus a fháil amach cé a rinne sé. I mo thuairimse, ón stair ina dhiaidh sin, is léir glacadh leis gur roghnaigh Dia Paul mar aspal. Anois is é seo an uair dheireanach a léaimid orthu ag iarraidh a aithint an toil Dé ag an réitigh de go leor nó de chineál seans rud.<br/>Tá a fhios agam ina chomhalta inniu, ag iarraidh toil an Tiarna a aithint, beidh sé ag guí agus a iarraidh ar an Tiarna ceist. Feicfidh sé go bhfuil deich pingin ina phóca, agus mar atá sé ag guí, beidh sé a chur ar an pinnies lena súile dúnta agus iad a chur síos ar an tábla, agus má tá siad ag teacht go léir suas cinnirí, tá sé ina yes. Rud suimiúil, gach uair amháin ar feadh tamaill, beidh siad ag teacht suas go léir cinnirí, agus sin go maith odds go leor., Ach, ní féidir linn teacht ar aon patrún le haghaidh seo tar éis an Spiorad Naomh a tugadh. Nuair a tháinig an Spiorad Naomh ar an eaglais, ansin thosaigh an Spiorad Naomh chun labhairt leo agus a ordú dóibh., Agus dúirt an Spiorad Naomh, "Seánraigh ris dom Paul agus Barnabas don aireacht nuair a thug mé orthu" (Acht 13:2). Agus chuir an Spiorad Naomh iad amach. Mar sin, faighimid an eaglais níos treoraithe go díreach ag an Spiorad Naomh. Chomh luath agus a tháinig an Spiorad Naomh, seo an dísle throwing a fháil amach an toil Dé bhí leagtha ar leataobh.<br/>"<br/><br/>Rí Séamas Leagan<br/><br/>Is é seo an 1769 Rí James Leagan an Bhíobla Naofa (ar a dtugtar an Leagan Údaraithe freisin).

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1. Well the mic is usually placed where it can have a connection to the PCB which are within the headphones so if you mean that the mic shouldn't be on the headphone itself, that (from my experience) is incorrect.<br/>2.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this ...<br/><br/>Click to expand...<br/><br/>But you are correct that a headphone driver can work as a "low quality" mic. In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Tugadh purges i gcoinne Stalin laistigh den pháirtí, lena n-áirítear Bukharin, Yagoda agus Rykov sna trialacha seó seo, mar gur chuir Stalin iallach orthu iad a admháil chun coup a phleanáil agus cur i gcoinne an stáit, fiú mura raibh aon chruthúnas ann. Arsa Gabriel T Rittersporn, "Bhí go leor de na híospartaigh dírithe ó chroí ar phrionsabail na Boiséivím."Aimplíonn sé seo cruthúnas go raibh na hidéil Bosek a bhí mar dhea-chomhartha ag an bPáirtí Cumannach a scriosadh uair amháin agus iad ag na Purges.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Tá Supercell ag cur thar maoil le brawls in ionad cumhachtaí réalta a chur ag cur isteach.

Nuair a imirt mé gem grab(thart ar 600 trófaithe), tá go minic cluichí áit a bhfuil an fhoireann namhaid amháin níos mó imreoir ná dúinn a bhfuil a maxed agus nach bhfuil sé fiú go bhfuil muid lv 9 chun dul san iomaíocht i gcoinne sin. Uaireanta tá fiú cluichí áit a bhfuil an fhoireann namhaid maxed go hiomlán agus nach bhfuil aon cheann de dúinn., Is é seo an fáth i dont réaltaí brawl a imirt dáiríre níos mó., Níl sé cosúil fiú go bhfuil imreoirí ann nach bhfuil measctha agus thart ar 600 trófaithe.Tá sé annoying.<br/>Cuir in eagar: Sílim gur chóir go mbeadh meicníocht bhunúsach ag supercell a thógann meán leibhéil brawls nuair a bhíonn cluichí á mbunú.<br/><br/>Ach amháin trófaithe nach bhfuil in iúl i ndáiríre do scil., Léiríonn siad an scil de na foirne a bhfuil tú a chur leis., Agus tá mé fíneáil le imirt i gcoinne brawls leibhéal níos airde, ach nuair nach bhfuil foireann amháin ar fad 10 agus nach bhfuil an fhoireann eile, go soiléir tá sé míchothrom.<br/><br/>Molaim a fháil roinnt cairde maith a imirt leis, mé agus fuair 2 cairde mo chairde cumhacht 1 tic a rangú 28 trí imirt GEM grab le comhdhéanamh áirithe an lá ar fad agus rinne muid é gan ceann amháin de dúinn a bheith maxed lenár brawls.<br/><br/>Tá a fhios agam conas a mhothaigh tú go raibh brawls i bhfíor-ard agat le leibhéal íseal agus tá sé deacair dul níos faide agus gach rud a bhí á rá agam liom féin "Ba mhaith liom cumhachtaí réalta" a bheith agam i ndáiríre iontach ní mór cothromaíocht a dhéanamh do na cumhachtaí réalta nó ar a laghad córas meaitseála níos fearr a dhéanamh.<br/><br/>Mé kinda bhraitheann seo., nach bhfuil mé chomh maith ag an cluiche mar atá tú, ach fuair mé Emz go 500 ag cumhacht 1 agus bhí an mheaitseáil uafásach.xed amach imreoirí i ngach áit!, Agus ní raibh sé cabhrú go raibh an chuid is mó de mo teammates thart ar 5-8k trófaithe... Bhí mé dul i muinín na seó aonair nóiméad deireanach mar is féidir liom ceachtar imreoirí unsuspecting nó imirt beagán ionsaitheach ag na hamanna ceart. Ach is mian liom i ndáiríre go bhféadfadh sé a bheith beagán níos éasca do dhaoine ar mian leo a bhrú brawls chun raon bua ard i ndáiríre gan a bheith ar an só cumhachtaí réalta.<br/><br/>Cé go bhfuil Spike Uile go maith fós gan cuar.Ní raibh Curveball ach cabhair chun do shots a bhualadh níos minice mar spíc.Ach fiú sula scaoileadh cuar, bhí Spike ina brawl i ndáiríre láidir, mar sin fanfaidh sé mar an gcéanna anois.<br/><br/>Aontaím gur chóir go mbeadh siad tar éis luíochán a chur siar, ach is dóigh liom go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh a chothromú araon Snappy Snipping agus luíochán, mar go bhfuil siad araon ag fáil chumasc leis an athrú seo., Bhí sí ag éirí ina cumhachtach beag, ach fós ní nerf- fiú<br/><br/>Níl mé cinnte faoi seo, ach anois go bhfuair Darryl buff suntasach, ag féachaint ar a gcuid stats nua, d'fhéadfadh sé cosúil le Darryl overshadow Bull, mar ní hamháin gur féidir leis déileáil i gcónaí níos mó damáiste ná Bull, ní bheidh sé bás chomh luath agus a bheidh a inmharthanacht a bheith cosúil gan chumhacht réalta (cé go bhfuil faireachas Bull fós níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé Guy diana). Ní amháin sin, is féidir Super Daryl ar athghiniúint uathoibríoch, rud a chiallaíonn Darrl MIGHT a bheith in ann a imirt go héifeachtach araon mar weighty AGUS assassin ag an am céanna (roimh sucks sé mar meáchan trom ach réasúnta mar assassin)<br/><br/>Ach tá sé overated af., Agus gheobhaidh tú trófaithe leis i ndáiríre go héasca., Mar sin im kinda ceart go leor leis an nerf., Tá mé tar éis a bhí fiú dó ó nuair a fuair mé é go dtí 500 (thart ar 5 mhí ó shin), ionas go mbeidh mé cúram go bhfuil i bhfad ceachtar.<br/><br/>Cén fáth nach bhfaigheann Poco/Pingy nerd HP, má tá siad Marksman / Healer faoi seach nach bhfuil umar?<br/>Cén fáth nach bhfuil an t-imcúlacht ag Rosa a chosaint, laghdú damáiste a rinne sé 70%?<br/>Cén fáth go bhfuil cead a bheith ag Tick an raon is airde agus an chuid is mó saor in aisce pokedamage sa chluiche ar fad?<br/>Cén fáth nach bhfaigheann Leon maolán HP/Damáiste?<br/><br/>Bíodh sin mar atá, bhí sé luíochán go raibh OP, bonn Píobaitheoir., Ba mhaith liom a mhaíomh go bhfuil Ambush é an chumhacht réalta is fearr sa chluiche (atá anois fiú níos mó ná sin ós rud é an céatadán de an méadú damáiste a chuaigh go hindíreach suas) agus bonn Píoba bhí a bun-10 brawl.<br/><br/>Is é an rud ba cheart do Supercell a dhéanamh ná an dá néaróg a thabhairt ar ais, luíochán a laghdú go 600, agus Snapchat go 0.25 a laghdú ós rud é gur mhaith leis a bheith fillte go hindíreach ag an buff damáiste bonn.<br/><br/>Yea agus creidim chuaigh siad beagán ró-i bhfad le Rosa, mar anois tá sí an tarbh níos fearr anois nuair a thagann sé chun ól, a bhí sí ar feadh tamaill. Anois, d'fhéadfadh Darryl bheith ina tarbh níos lú, níos cumhachtaí<br/><br/>Cén fáth? Is dóigh liom go gcaithfidh sí buff i mbeagnach gach rud seachas a cumhacht réalta.Déanann a sláinte agus a luas sár-iarracht í a úsáid, mar is féidir léi bás a fháil go héasca, agus tá sé an-deacair di gaiste a dhéanamh idir brawls níos tapúla cosúil le Crow. Tá a chumhacht réalta beagán briste cé... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Féinfhostaíocht Cuid 1<br/><br/>Nuair a ghlacann tú le fostaíocht in aon eagraíocht, caithfidh tú poist éagsúla a dhéanamh de réir riachtanais d’fhostóra agus d’fhéadfá méid socraithe ioncaim a fháil mar thuarastal. Is féidir leat siopa miondíola beag a reáchtáil, siopa a chur in oiriúint, bialann, bácúis agus milseogra, salon áilleacht, etc.Is féidir leat dul i mbun trádála nó déantúsaíochta ar scála beag nó roinnt seirbhíse a sholáthar do phraghas.
