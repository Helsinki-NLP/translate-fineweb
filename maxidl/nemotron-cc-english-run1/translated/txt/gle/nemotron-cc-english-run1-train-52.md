|  LAWYER IN AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE<br/><br/>As human beings we struggle between good and bad—both internally and within a community of others who struggle as well. A society's popular culture reflects such basic human concerns and can be seen through the records it keeps. Undeniably, American popular culture has been well recorded. By looking at contemporary commentary, literature, and film we are able to see how the important issues of the times—our society's struggles to define what's right and wrong—have been reflected throughout our history. And what better venue to illustrate the eternal struggle between good and bad than the legal profession, which by definition exists to ensure that the rule of law is upheld, that good prevails.<br/><br/>Lawyers enter the legal profession intending to preserve justice and champion individual rights while at the same time ensuring the common good—at least they re supposed to. These are lofty goals considering that lawyers are no less "human" than anyone else, prone to the same abuse of power. By defining the different sides of a particular issue— or aspects of a profession—writers, journalists, artists, and filmmakers provide the reading and viewing public with materials that can both entertain us and make us think. As far as the legal profession is concerned, we see a good lawyer as a reflection of people's hopes, and a bad lawyer as a reflection of people's worst fears. Given the vital importance of the integrity of the law in America, and our natural cynicism when it comes to entrusting our future with an individual, is it any wonder that over the course of this country's history, the legal system in its entirety is more often than not viewed as a slew of rascals, cither distorting the law in their own self-interest or sidelining common justice in order to protect criminals and maintain deep pockets. We are especially interested in recognizing the bad, self-serving lawyer because our deepest wish is that if we need a lawyer, we will get one of the good ones!<br/><br/>Judging from the historical record, the trivialization of the lawyer in popular culture appears to be a time-honored theme, stretching as far back as the beginning of the modern period, when the process of consolidating a fragmented legal system into a coherent whole began. A late-seventeenth-century anonymous "legal coat of arms" depicts allegorically the purported values and interests of law professionals. The scene presents a fox, hardly a symbol of trustworthiness, surrounded by two figures of Questionable character, at least one of them a wealthy client. Following a theme that reappears consistently throughout the history of popular attitudes toward lawyers, the fox spews forth long reams of legal rhetoric in broken Latin, underscoring lawyers' incapacity to "speak the truth" or engage in common-sense dialogue. And as if to drive the satiric dagger deeper still, the reason for such slyness is plain and simple: the deep loyalty to material well-being rather than to the principle of social justice or the defense of the common man. Thus the designs' motto of "DUM VIVO THRIVO," which translates into "Where I live, I thrive." | DLÍ IN AGHAIDH NA TÚDARÁIN INMHEÁNACHAS<br/><br/>De réir mar a bhíonn an duine ag streachailt idir mhaith agus olc - go hinmheánach agus laistigh de phobal daoine eile a bhíonn ag streachailt chomh maith. Léiríonn cultúr an phobail a leithéid de cheisteanna bunúsacha daonna agus is féidir é a fheiceáil trí na taifid a choinníonn sé. Ní féidir é a shéanadh, tá taifead maith déanta ar chultúr móréilimh Mheiriceá. Trí bhreathnú ar chomhaimseartha, ar litríocht agus ar scannán táimid in ann a fheiceáil conas a léiríodh na saincheisteanna tábhachtacha a bhaineann leis an am – streachailt ár sochaí chun na rudaí atá ceart agus mícheart a aithint – ar fud ár stair. Agus cén t-ionad is fearr chun an streachailt síoraí a léiriú idir mhaith agus olc ná an ghairm dhlíthiúil, atá ann de réir sainmhínithe chun a chinntiú go seastar leis an smacht reachta, go n-eascraíonn an dea-rialachas.<br/><br/>Téann dlíodóirí isteach sa ghairm dhlíthiúil a bhfuil sé i gceist acu cearta an duine aonair a chaomhnú agus cur chun cinn a dhéanamh orthu agus ag an am céanna an leas coiteann a chinntiú—is é sin, ar a laghad, gur thacaigh siad leis. Is spriocanna troma iad seo a mheasann nach lú "duine" iad dlíodóirí ná duine ar bith eile, a bhfuil an mhí-úsáid chéanna cumhachta acu. Trí thaobh éagsúil de shaincheist ar leith a shainiú—nó gnéithe de ghairm—scríbhneoir, iriseoirí, ealaíontóirí agus scannánóirí ábhar a chur ar fáil don phobal léitheoireachta agus féachana a chuirfidh ar ár gcumas siamsaíocht a thabhairt dúinn agus machnamh a dhéanamh orainn. Chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis an ghairm dhlíthiúil, feicimid dlíodóir maith mar léiriú ar dhó daoine, agus droch-dhlíodóir mar léiriú ar an eagla is measa atá ag daoine. Mar gheall ar thábhacht ríthábhachtach iomláine an dlí i Meiriceá, agus ár gciníochais nádúrtha nuair a thagann sé chun iontaoibh ár dtodhchaí le duine aonair, is ionadh é go mbíonn an córas dlí ina iomláine níos minice ná mar a fhéachann sé ar a leas féin nó ar a gceartas a chosaint agus a chothabháil pócaí doimhne. Tá suim ar leith againn an droch-chaoi a aithint, an dlíodóir féinfhreastail mar is mian lenár dream is doimhne ná más gá dúinn dlíodóir a bheith againn, gheobhaimid ceann de na cinn mhaithe!<br/><br/>Ag breithiúnas ón taifead stairiúil, is cosúil gur téama am-onóir é fánach an dlíodóir sa chultúr móréilimh, ag síneadh chomh fada siar le tús na tréimhse nua-aimseartha, nuair a thosaigh an próiseas chun córas dlí ilroinnte a chomhdhlúthú ina iomláine. Léiríonn cóta dlíthiúil na n-arm ón seachtú haois déag luachanna agus leasanna ionchasacha an dlí atá beartaithe go heolaíoch. Cuireann an radharc sionnach, ar éigean siombail iontaofa, timpeallaithe ag dhá fhigiúr de charachtar amhrasach, ceann amháin ar a laghad acu ina chliant saibhir. Tar éis téama a athmhúnlú go comhsheasmhach ar fud stair an dearcadh coitianta i leith dlíodóirí, ritheann an sionnach amach iarsmaí fada de reitric dhlíthiúil i Laidin bhriste, a chuireann béim ar éagumas dlíodóirí chun “an fhírinne” nó a théann i mbun comhphlé tuiscinta. Agus amhail is dá mba rud é a thiomáint ar an dagger satir fós níos doimhne, is é an chúis atá leis an slyness den sórt sin plain agus simplí: an dílseacht domhain d'fholláine an ábhair seachas an prionsabal an cheartais shóisialta nó an chosaint ar an fear coitianta. Dá bhrí sin an dearadh mana "DUM VIVO THERIVO", a aistríonn go "Cá bhfuil cónaí orm, rathaím." |
| Do the Templars control the world today?<br/><br/>I meet and talk to people in very different situations who are convinced that the Knights Templar in some guise or other control the world. How do they come to this view?<br/><br/>A few months ago, I was talking to a young British Muslim and mentioned this blog. "Well, of course, they totally run the world, right?" I thought he was joking. He was university educated, very bright and well read. But no. He meant it. 100%.<br/><br/>Similarly, I've come across people who argue that Pope Francis, as a Jesuit, must be part of a Templar plot because the Jesuits are really secret Templars.<br/><br/>Let me run through some of the recent theories I've discovered online about Templars running the world:<br/><br/>Templars control us from Switzerland<br/><br/>Haven't you ever noticed how similar the Swiss and Templar flags are?<br/><br/>Swiss neutrality is not a result of loving peace but because they are too busy orchestrating wars through which the Templars control us | An bhfuil na Templars rialú ar fud an domhain inniu?<br/><br/>Buaileann mé le chéile agus labhair le daoine i gcásanna an-difriúil atá cinnte go bhfuil an Teampall Ridirí i roinnt guise nó rialú eile ar fud an domhain.<br/><br/>Cúpla mí ó shin, bhí mé ag caint le Moslamach óg na Breataine agus luaigh mé an blag seo. "Bhuel, ar ndóigh, rith siad go hiomlán ar fud an domhain, ceart?" Shíl mé go raibh sé ag magadh. Bhí sé oilte ar an ollscoil, an-gheal agus go maith ag léamh.Ach ní chiallaigh sé é.<br/><br/>Mar an gcéanna, tá mé ag teacht ar fud na ndaoine a mhaíomh go bhfuil an Pápa Francis, mar Íosa, a bheith mar chuid de plota Teimpléar toisc go bhfuil na Giúdaigh i ndáiríre rúnda Temples.<br/><br/>Lig dom rith trí chuid de na teoiricí le déanaí fuair mé amach ar líne faoi Theampaill ag rith an domhain:<br/><br/>Teimpléid a rialú linn ón Eilvéis<br/><br/>Nach bhfuil tú faoi deara riamh cé chomh cosúil go bhfuil na bratacha na hEilvéise agus an Teampaill?<br/><br/>Ní hionann neodracht na hEilvéise agus an tsíocháin grámhar ach toisc go bhfuil siad ró-ghnóthach ag déanamh craolacháin ar chogaí trína rialaíonn na hAimpléid |

| Ahah, thanks. Since I've collected everything for the home instance so far, I'm adding that. Everything but the treasure chest thing, anyway. Hooray for having cleared my bank out of some valuable cruft the other day, I didn't have to toss cash at it!It also comes down to usability, a salvage-o-matic provides different levels of convenience depending on how much you intend to use it, because the action of salvaging is repeatable, up to thousands of times a day if you were so inclined.<br/><br/>Same for an infinite harvesting tool, you can run around the open world harvesting for 8 hours a day if you wish.<br/><br/>These home nodes are novelty items, not convenience items. They provide exactly one use every 24 hours, incredibly limited usability. And essentially they save you from tapping your "O" key and buying up to 12 T1 – T3 light scraps once a day. Which, arguably, I think is actually the more convenient option.<br/><br/>Now if these worked like regular nodes, where they refreshed every hour, then I would consider them convenience items. And they'd work similarly to salvage-o-matics and infinite tools in that what you get out of them is essentially what you're willing to put into them. I think very few players would actually be disciplined enough to swap to their Home character and mine them every hour on the hour.<br/><br/>But as novelty items, that makes it no different from spending 200g on one skin versus a free to apply skin. If that's what you're into, go for it.<br/><br/>But a skin is something you would actually get use from considering GW2 endgame is basically dress up wars 2. The harvesting tools and salvage tools are great convenience items.<br/><br/>The node packs, OTOH, are a waste of time and money. Going to the TP and buying 200 scraps at once rather than 5 minutes a day for 2 months to get the same thing is silly. I don't care if you buy them, but my original point is it's a fair comparison to make with the amount of gold/gems they cost.<br/><br/>Well, it's the Basic Cloth Rack, there really isn't any reason to believe it would be any different from the Basic Lumber and Basic Ore Nodes packs: a pittance of the lowest three tiers every 24 hoursIf they would offer a bank for the home instance, than it would be for convenience yes. But nodes, no. A node is simply for profit. I can imagine that it could offer some convenience IF it was certain what you will get. That is not the case. So again: no, this is not for convenience.<br/><br/>I bought it immediately when it came out. Sure, it'll never pay for itself, but I like having that extra source of cloth and the idea of my mule just wandering over each day and stealing clothes off some poor merchant's rack is hilarious. XDAccording to the wiki this does NOT count toward Daily GathererAt least in the case of the cloth rack, it seems to me that helps people who have only high level characters get some low-level cloth without buying it off the TP, since loot drops will mostly be higher level stuffIndeed. It is still a convenient way to get a bunch of low level crafting materials though. The daily gathering part was more to the nodes as a whole in the home instance, seeing as we have had the exact same thread every single time one of these were released.<br/><br/>Low level cloth items are harder to get due to scaling. High level characters usually don't get low enough stuff to salvage into the lower tier materials.<br/><br/>I really thought I'll have 3 of each when I bought it. I mean, all of the others stuff like that works that way, and costs 1000 gems. I'm really disappointed can we ask for a refound or something ? I'm so tired of all RNG mechanics in this, and now even the stuff we buy on TP provides us RNG based results…There is no waypoint rezzing in real life,<br/>but there are people who will help you get back up when you are downed<br/>- PalwaJokoANet, please upgrade my Cloth Rack so it also gives out Linen and Silk, kthx. | Ó shin i leith tá mé a bhailiú gach rud le haghaidh an staid baile go dtí seo, tá mé ag cur sin., Gach rud, mar sin, ach an Treasure cófra, ar aon nós., Hoody as tar éis a ghlanadh mo bhanc as roinnt cruft luachmhar an lá eile, ní raibh mé ag airgead tirim ar sé!

| I enjoy reading Corey Quinn's Last week in AWS newsletter. And also really like his podcast Screaming in the cloud. This week Corey talks with Jay Gordon from Mongodb. While Jay seems somewhat of an advocate of multicloud, Corey is decidedly critical. Which makes for a great interview!<br/><br/>Corey also wrote a piece The Myth of cloud agnosticism. I like any writing that dubs a popular trope as a "myth" because it's an opportunity to poke holes in optimism.<br/><br/>It is through this process that we become realistic, which is crucial to being reliable in operations and engineering.<br/><br/>Corey argues that multicloud, with respect to multiple infrastructure providers is usually a crappy idea. That's because the cloud providers are evolving, your application is evolving, and it costs you in terms of feature velocity. What's more it provides dubious instant uptime in the DR realm.<br/><br/>The topic reminds me of similar myths in computer science… the myth of cross platform development or<br/>the myth of the cross platform databases the myth of object relational modeling.<br/><br/>As always your mileage may vary. Here are my questions. Hope they can help provide perspective, and critical thinking around this.<br/><br/>1. Do you plan to use multiple cloud providers for infrastructure? And deploy your application twice?<br/>2. Do you plan to use multiple SaaS providers?<br/>3. Does hybrid cloud make sense? That's an option where you deploy a data link to a public cloud, keeping some assets in your own datacenter.<br/>4. Are their feature parallels across your chosen clouds? Or are there feature mismatches?<br/>5. Your cloud providers have independent service level agreements. Are they consistent or not?<br/><br/>6. What does the outage history look like for each of your providers?<br/>7. What is the potential for fatfinger outage on each platform? For example one may be unduly complicated and prone to mistakes, based on API or dashboard interface.<br/>8. Is one cloud more complicated to implement? For example Amazon Web Services while being more feature rich, is also much more complicated to deploy than a Digital Ocean setup.<br/>9. You can see your backups on both platforms. Have you done restores on both? Regularly? Recently?<br/>10. Do you have time to automate everything twice? For example you may need to rewrite your ansible playbooks for each platform<br/><br/>11. What is driving your business to embrace the idea of multicloud?<br/>12. Do you have time to rewrite scripts twice? one-off and user-data scripts alike?<br/>13. Do you have time to firedrill twice? Smoketest twice?<br/>14. Will different clouds fail in different ways? For example one might be weak around it's network. Another might be weak around it's database service, and a third might encounter multi-tenant traffic congestion (disk or network).<br/>15. When one cloud doesn't support a feature, Ex: lifecycle policies on S3 buckets, do you need to build it for the other cloud?<br/><br/>16. Will deploying multicloud encourage abstraction layers Ex: object relational modelers (ORM) which heavily slow down performance?<br/>17. Have you tested performance on both clouds?<br/>18. Is cloud #2 a temporary disaster recovery solution or an on-going load balancing solution via geo-dns?<br/>19. If you go hybrid cloud, how does that impact security, firewalls, and access controls?<br/>20. How do you monitor your object stores (S3), scanning for open buckets? Do you rewrite this code for the other API?<br/><br/>21. What are the disaster types you're planning for?<br/>22. What is the cost of maintaining your application on multiple platforms?<br/>23. What is the cost of building infra for multiple platforms?<br/>24. What is the cost of debugging & troubleshooting on multiple platforms?<br/>25. How does multcloud complicate deployments?<br/><br/>26. Does multicloud complicate GDPR and other compliance questions?<br/>27. How does multicloud complicate your billing and budget management?<br/>28. What about microservices? How will these multiple platforms play across two clouds?<br/>29. Is the community around each cloud equally active?<br/>30. If you deploy with an infrastructure as code language like Terraform, is there an active community there for both of your chosen clouds?<br/><br/>31. Does each provider support customers well? What are their respective reputations?<br/>32. Is each cloud provider equally solvent & invested in the business? Will they be around in a year? five years? ten years?<br/>33. What complications arise when migrating to or from this provider?<br/><br/>EKS is a service to run kubernetes, so you don't have to install the software, or manage or patch it. Just like GKS on Google, kubernetes as a service is really the way to go if you want to build kubernetes apps on AWS.<br/><br/>So where do we get started? AWS docs are still coming together, so it's not easy. I would start with Jerry Hargrove's amazing EKS diagram. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one is work 10,000!<br/><br/>1. Build your EKS cluster<br/><br/>I already did this in Terraform. There aren't a lot of howtos, so I wrote one.<br/><br/>Basically you setup the service role, the cluster, then the worker nodes. Once you've done that you're ready to run the demo app.<br/><br/>2. Build your app spec<br/><br/>These are very similar to ECS tasks. You'll need to make slight changes. mountPoints become VolumeMounts, links get removed, and workingDirectory becomes workingDir and so on. Most of these changes are obvious, but the json syntax is obviously the biggest bear you'll wrestle with.<br/><br/>It's not if, but when to move to the cloud, how to get there, and how fast will be the transition?<br/><br/>Here are my thoughts on what to start thinking about.<br/><br/>1. Ramp up team, skills & paradigm thinking<br/><br/>Teams with experience in traditional datacenters have certain ways of architecting solutions, and thinking about problems. For example they may choose NFS servers to host objects, where in the cloud you will use object storage such as S3.<br/><br/>S3 has all sorts of new features, like lifecycle policies, and super super redundant eleven 9's of durability. But your applications may need to be retrofitted to work with it, and your devs may need to learn about new features and functionality.<br/><br/>What about networking? This changes a lot in the cloud, with VPCs, and virtual appliances like NATs and Gateways. And what about security groups?<br/><br/>Interacting with this new world of cloud resources, requires new skillsets and new ways of thinking. So priority one will be getting your engineering teams learning, and upgrading skills. I wrote a piece about this how do I migrate my skills to the cloud?<br/><br/>2. Adapt to a new security model<br/><br/>With the old style datacenter, you typically have a firewall, and everything gets blocked & controlled. The new world of cloud computing uses security groups. These can be applied at the network level, across your VPC, or at the server level. And of course you can have many security groups with overlapping jurisdictions. Here's how you setup a VPC with Terraform<br/><br/>So understanding how things work in the public cloud is quite new and challenging. There are ingress and egress rules, ways to audit with network flow logs, and more.<br/><br/>However again, it's one thing to have the features available, it's quite another to put them to proper use.<br/><br/>3. Adapt to fragile components & networks<br/><br/>While the public cloud collectively is extremely resilient, the individual components such as EC2 instances are decidedly not reliable. It's expected that they can and will die frequently. It's your job as the customer to build things in a self-healing way.<br/><br/>That means VPCs with multiple subnets, across availability zones (multi-az). And that means redundant instances for everything. What's more you front your servers with load balancers (classic or application). These themselves are redundant.<br/><br/>Whether you are building a containerized application and deploying on ECS or a traditional auto-scaling webserver with database backend, you'll need to plan for failure. And that means code that detects, and reacts to such failures without downtime to the end user.<br/><br/>So there's a learning curve. Both for your operations teams who have previously called Rackspace to get a new server provisioned. And also for your business, learning what incurs an outage, and the tricky finicky sides to managing your public cloud through code.<br/><br/>5. Audit, log & monitor<br/><br/>As you automate more and more pieces, you may have less confidence in the overall scope of your deployments. How many servers am I using right now? How many S3 buckets? What about elastic IPs?<br/><br/>As your automation can itself spinup new temporary environments, those resource counts will change from moment to moment. Even a spike in user engagement or a sudden flash sale, can change your cloud footprint in an instant.<br/><br/>That's where heavy use of logging such as ELK (elasticsearch, logstash and kibana) can really help. Sure AWS offers CloudWatch and CloudTrail, but again you must put it all to good use.<br/><br/>I've been on both sides of the fence, at times interviewing candidates, and other times the candidate looking to impress to win a new role.<br/><br/>Here are my suggestions…<br/><br/>Devops Pipeline<br/><br/>Jenkins isn't the only build server, but it's been around a long time, so it's everywhere. You can also do well with CircleCI or Travis. Or even Amazon's own CodeBuild & CodePipeline.<br/><br/>You should also be comfortable with a configuration management system. Ansible is my personal favorite but obviously there is lots of Puppet & Chef out there too. Talk about a playbook you wrote, how it configures the server, installs packages, edits configs and restarts services.<br/><br/>Bonus points if you can talk about handling deployments with autoscaling groups. Those dynamic environments can't easily be captured in static host manifests, so talk about how you handle that.<br/><br/>Of course you should also be strong with Git, bitbucket or codecommit. Talk about how you create a branch, what's gitflow and when/how do you tag a release.<br/><br/>Also be ready to talk about how a code checkin can trigger a post commit hook, which then can go and build your application, or new infra to test your code.<br/><br/>CloudFormation or Terraform<br/><br/>I'm partial to Terraform. Terraform is MacOSX or iPhone to CloudFormation as Android or Windows. Why do I say that? Well it's more polished and a nicer language to write in. CloudFormation is downright ugly. But hey both get the job done.<br/><br/>AWS Services<br/><br/>There are lots of them. But the core services, are what you should be ready to talk about. CloudWatch for centralized logging. How does it integrate with ECS or EKS?<br/><br/>Route53, how do you create a zone? How do you do geo load balancing? How does it integrate with CertificateManager? Can Terraform build these things?<br/><br/>EC2 is the basic compute service. Tell me what happens when an instance dies? When it boots? What is a user-data script? How would you use one? What's an AMI? How do you build them?<br/><br/>What about virtual networking? What is a VPC? And a private subnet? What's a public subnet? How do you deploy a NAT? WHat's it for? How do security groups work?<br/><br/>What are S3 buckets? Talk about infraquently accessed? How about glacier? What are lifecycle policies? How do you do cross region replication? How do you setup cloudfront? What's a distribution?<br/><br/>What types of load balancers are there? Classic & Application are the main ones. How do they differ? ALB is smarter, it can integrate with ECS for example. What are some settings I should be concerned with? What about healthchecks?<br/><br/>What is Autoscaling? How do I setup EC2 instances to do this? What's an autoscaling group? Target? How does it work with ECS? What about EKS?<br/><br/>Devops isn't about writing application code, but you're surely going to be writing jobs. What language do you like? Python and shell scripting are a start. What about Lambda? Talk about frameworks to deploy applications.<br/><br/>Databases<br/><br/>You should have some strong database skills even if you're not the day-to-day DBA. Amazon RDS certainly makes administering a bit easier most of the time. But upgrade often require downtime, and unfortunately that's wired into the service. I see mostly Postgresql, MySQL & Aurora. Get comfortable tuning SQL queries and optimizing. Analyze your slow query log and provide an output.<br/><br/>Amazon's analytics offering is getting stronger. The purpose built Redshift is everywhere these days. It may use a postgresql driver, but there's a lot more under the hood. You also may want to look at SPectrum, which provides a EXTERNAL TABLE type interface, to query data directly from S3.<br/><br/>Not on Redshift yet? Well you can use Athena as an interface directly onto your data sitting in S3. Even quicker.<br/><br/>For larger data analysis or folks that have systems built around the technology, Hadoop deployments or EMR may be good to know as well. At least be able to talk intelligently about it.<br/><br/>Questions<br/><br/>Have you written any CloudFormation templates or Terraform code? For example how do you create a VPC with private & public subnets, plus bastion box with Terraform? What gotches do you run into?<br/><br/>If you are given a design document, how do you proceed from there? How do you build infra around those requirements? What is your first step? What questions would you ask about the doc?<br/><br/>What do you know about Nodejs? Or Python? Why do you prefer that language?<br/><br/>If you were asked to store 500 terrabytes of data on AWS and were going to do analysis of the data what would be your first choice? Why? Let's say you evaluated S3 and Athena, and found the performance wasn't there, what would you move to? Redshift? How would you load the data?<br/><br/>Describe a multi-az VPC setup that you recommend. How do you deploy multiple subnets in a high availability arragement?<br/><br/>Here are a few of the lessons I learned in the process of building code for AWS. It's not easy but when you get there you can enjoy the vistas. They're pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Don't pass credentials<br/><br/>As you build your applications, there are moments where components need to use AWS in some way. Your webserver needs to use S3 or your ELK box needs to use CloudWatch. Maybe you want to do an RDS backup, or list EC2 instances.<br/><br/>However it's not safe to pass your access_key and secret_access_key around. Those should be for your desktop only. So how best to handle this in the cloud?<br/><br/>IAM roles to the rescue. These are collections of privileges. The cool thing is they can be assigned at the INSTANCE LEVEL. Meaning your whole server has permissions to use said resources.<br/><br/>Do this by first creating a role with the privileges you want. Create a json policy document which outlines the specific rules as you see fit. Then create an instance profile for that role.<br/><br/>When you create your ec2 instance in Terraform, you'll specify that instance profile. Either by ARN or if Terraform created it, by resource ID.<br/><br/>Keep passwords out of code<br/><br/>Even though we know it should not happen, sometimes it does. We need to be vigilant to stay on top of this problem. There are projects like Pivotal's credential scan. This can be used to check your source files for passwords.<br/><br/>What about something like RDS? You're going to need to specify a password in your Terraform code right? Wrong! You can define a variable with no default as follows:<br/><br/>variable "my_rds_pass" {<br/>description = "password for rds database"<br/>}<br/><br/>When Terraform comes upon this variable in your code, but sees there is no "default" value, it will prompt you when you do "$ terraform apply"<br/><br/>Versioning your code<br/><br/>When you first start building terraform code, chances are you create a directory, and some tf files, then do your "$ terraform apply". When you watch that infra build for the first time, it's exciting!<br/><br/>After you add more components, your code gets more complex. Hopefully you've created a git repo to house your code. You can check & commit the files, so you have them in a safe place. But of course there's more to the equation than this.<br/><br/>How do you handle multiple environments, dev, stage & production all using the same code?<br/><br/>That's where modules come in. Now at the beginning you may well have a module that looks like this:<br/><br/>Etc and so on. That's the first step in the right direction, however if you change your source code, all of your environments will now be using that code. They will get it as soon as you do "$ terraform apply" for each. That's fine, but it doesn't scale well.<br/><br/>Ultimately you want to manage your code like other software projects. So as you make changes, you'll want to tag it.<br/><br/>Cool! Now each dev, stage and prod can reference a different version. So you are free to work on the infra without interrupting stage or prod. When you're ready to promote that code, checkin, tag and update stage.<br/><br/>You could go a step further to be more agile, and have a post-commit hook that triggers the stage terraform apply. This though requires you to build solid infra tests. Checkout testinfra and terratest.<br/><br/>Managing RDS backups<br/><br/>My recent discovery is even more serious! Terraform wants to build infra. And it wants to be able to later destroy that infra. In the case of databases, obviously the previous state is one you want to keep. You want that to be perpetual, beyond the infra build. Obvious, no?<br/><br/>Apparently not to the folks at Amazon. When you destroy an RDS instance it will destroy all the old backups you created. I have no idea why anyone would want this. Certainly not as a default behavior. What's worse you can't copy those backups elsewhere. Why not? They're probably sitting in S3 anyway!<br/><br/>While you can take a final backup when you destroy an RDS instance, that's wondeful and I recommend it. However that's not enough. I highly suggest you take matters into your own hands. Build a script that calls pg_dump yourself, and copy those .sql or .dump files to S3 for safe keeping.<br/><br/>When to use force_destroy on S3 buckets<br/><br/>As with RDS, when you create S3 buckets with your infra, you want to be able to cleanup later. But the trouble is that once you create a bucket, you'll likely fill it with objects and files.<br/><br/>What then happens is when you go to do "$ terraform destroy" it will fail with an error. This makes sense as a default behavior. We don't want data disappearing without our knowledge.<br/><br/>However you do want to be able to cleanup. So what to do? Two things.<br/><br/>Firstly, create a process, perhaps a lambda job or other bucket replication to regularly sync your s3 bucket to your permanent bucket archive location. Run that every fifteen minutes or as often as you need.<br/><br/>Then add a force_destroy line to your s3 bucket resource. Here's an example s3 bucket for storing load balancer logs:<br/><br/>When you see headlines like this, your first instinct as a CTO is probably, "Am I at risk?" And then "What are the chances of this happening to me?"<br/><br/>Truth can be stranger than fiction. Our efforts as devops should be towards mitigating risk, and reducing potential for these kinds of things to happen.<br/><br/>1. Use aws instance profiles instead<br/><br/>Those credentials that aws provides, are great for enabling the awscli. That's because you control your desktop tightly. Don't you?<br/><br/>But passing them around in your application code is prone to trouble. Eventually they'll end up in a git repo. Not good!<br/><br/>The solution is applying aws IAM permissions at the instance level. That's right, you can grant an instance permissions to read or write an s3 bucket, describe instances, create & write to dynamodb, or anything else in aws. The entire cloud is api configurable. You create a custom policy for your instance, and attach it to a named instance profile.<br/><br/>When you spinup your EC2 instance, or later modify it, you attach that instance profile, and voila! The instance has those permissions! No messy credentials required!<br/><br/>3. blah blah<br/><br/>Hey, while you're at it, why not add a post commit hook to your code repo in git. Have it run the credentials scan each time code is committed. And when it finds trouble, it should email out the whole team.<br/><br/>ECS is Amazon's Elastic Container Service. That's greek for how you get docker containers running in the cloud. It's sort of like Kubernetes without all the bells and whistles.<br/><br/>It takes a bit of getting used to, but This terraform how to, should get you moving. You need an EC2 host to run your containers on, you need a task that defines your container image & resources, and lastly a service which tells ECS which cluster to run on and registers with ALB if you have one.<br/><br/>For each of these sections, create files: roles.tf, instance.tf, task.tf, service.tf, alb.tf. What I would recommend is create the first file roles.tf, then do:<br/><br/>$ terraform init<br/>$ terraform plan<br/>$ terraform apply<br/><br/>Then move on to instance.tf and do the terraform apply. One by one, next task, then service then finally alb. This way if you encounter errors, you can troubleshoot minimally, rather than digging through five files for the culprit.<br/><br/>I recommend deploying in the public subnets for your first run, to avoid complexity of jump box, and private IPs for ecs instance etc.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>May the terraform force be with you!<br/><br/>First setup roles<br/><br/>Roles are a really brilliant part of the aws stack. Inside of IAM or identity access and management, you can create roles. These are collections of privileges. I'm allowed to use this S3 bucket, but not others. I can use EC2, but not Athena. And so forth. There are some special policies already created just for ECS and you'll need roles to use them.<br/><br/>These roles will be applied at the instance level, so your ecs host doesn't have to pass credentials around. Clean. Secure. Smart!<br/><br/>Setup your ecs host instance<br/><br/>Next you need EC2 instances on which to run your docker containers. Turns out AWS has already built AMIs just for this purpose. They call them ECS Optimized Images. There is one unique AMI id for each region. So be sure you're using the right one for your setup.<br/><br/>The other thing that your instance needs to do is echo the cluster name to /etc/ecs/ecs.config. You can see us doing that in the user_data script section.<br/><br/>Lastly we're configuring our instance inside of an auto-scaling group. That's so we can easily add more instances dynamically to scale up or down as necessary.<br/><br/>Setup your task definition<br/><br/>The third thing you need is a task. This one will spinup a generic nginx container. It's a nice way to demonstrate things. For your real world usage, you'll replace the image line with a docker image that you've pushed to ECR. I'll leave that as an exercise. Once you have the cluster working, you should get the hang of things.<br/><br/>Note the portmappings, memory and CPU. All things you might expect to see in a docker-compose.yml file. So these tasks should look somewhat familiar.<br/><br/>Setup your service definition<br/><br/>The fourth thing you need to do is setup a service. The task above is a manifest, describing your containers needs. It is now registered, but nothing is running.<br/><br/>When you apply the service your container will startup. What I like to do is, ssh into the ecs host box. Get comfortable. Then issue $ watch "docker ps". This will repeatedly run "docker ps" every two seconds. Once you have that running, do your terraform apply for this service piece.<br/><br/>As you watch, you'll see ECS start your container, and it will suddenly appear in your watch terminal. It will first show "starting". Once it is started, it should say "healthy".<br/><br/>Setup your application load balancer<br/><br/>The above will all work by itself. However for a real-world use case, you'll want to have an ALB. This one has only a simple HTTP port 80 listener. These are much simpler than setting up 443 for SSL, so baby steps first.<br/><br/>Once you have the ALB going, new containers will register with the target group, to let the alb know about them. In "docker ps" you'll notice they are running on a lot of high numbered ports. These are the hostPorts which are dynamically assigned. The container ports are all 80.<br/><br/>You will also want to add a domain name, so that as your infra changes, and if you rebuild your ALB, the name of your application doesn't vary. Route53 will adjust as terraform changes are applied. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>ECS is Amazon's elastic container service. If you have a dockerized app, this is one way to get it deployed in the cloud. It is basically an Amazon bootleg Kubernetes clone. And not nearly as feature rich! 🙂<br/><br/>That said, ECS does work, and it will allow you to get your application going on Amazon. Soon enough EKS (Amazon's Kubernetes service) will be production, and we'll all happily switch.<br/><br/>Meantime, if you're struggling with the weird errors, and when it is silently failing, I have some help here for you. Hopefully these various error cases are ones you've run into, and this helps you solve them.<br/><br/>Why is my container in a stopped state?<br/><br/>Containers can fail for a lot of different reasons. The litany of causes I found were:<br/><br/>When ecs repeatedly fails, it leaves around stopped containers. These eat up system resources, without much visible feedback. "df -k" or "df -m" doesn't show you volumes filled up. *BUT* there are logical volumes which can fill.<br/><br/>3. My container gets killed before fully started<br/><br/>When a service is run, ECS wants to have *all* of the containers running together. Just like when you use docker-compose. If one container fails, ecs-agent may decide to kill the entire service, and restart. So you may see weird things happening in "docker logs" for one container, simply because another failed. What to do?<br/><br/>First look at your task definition, and set "essential = false". That way if one fails, the other will still run. So you can eliminate the working container as a cause.<br/><br/>Next thing is remember some containers may startup almost instantly, like nginx for example. Because it is a very small footprint, it can start in a second or two. So if *it* depends on another container that is slow, nginx will fail. That's because in the strange world of docker discovery, that other container doesn't even exist yet. While nginx references it, it says hey, I don't see the upstream server you are pointing to.<br/><br/>Solution? Be sure you have a "links" section in your task definition. This tells ecs-agent, that one container depends on another (think of the depends_on flag in docker-compose).<br/><br/>4. Understanding container ordering<br/><br/>As you are building your ecs manifest aka task definition, you want to run through your docker-compose file carefully. Review the links, essential flags and depends_on settings. Then be sure to mirror those in your ECS task.<br/><br/>When in doubt, reduce the scope of your problem. That is define *only one* container, then start the service. Once that container works, add a second. When you get that working as well, add a third or other container.<br/><br/>This approach allows you to eliminate interconnecting dependencies, and related problems. | Agus is maith liom an tseachtain seo a chaitheamh ag léamh An tseachtain seo caite i nuachtlitir AWS, agus is cosúil go bhfuil a phodchraoladh Screaming sa scamall.

Na hacmhainní córais seo, gan aiseolas i bhfad infheicthe. "df -k" nó "df-m" ní léiríonn siad méideanna a líonadh suas. * Tá méideanna loighciúla ann is féidir a líonadh.<br/><br/>3.

Mar sin, má bhraitheann sé * ar choimeádán eile atá mall, teipfidh nignx.
