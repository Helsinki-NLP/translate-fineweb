| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Agus é ag aithint go bhfuil sé dodhéanta duine a argóint chun rud éigin grámhar a thaitníonn leo, agus a mhalairt, is minic a bhíonn sé taitneamhach iarracht a dhéanamh ar an argóint.

Bhíomar ina shuí in aice lena chéile le linn Hugo Martin scorse - mise, agus is cosúil go raibh sé ag cur i gcoinne iontais na pictiúrlainne luaithe a bhí ann, agus is cosúil go raibh tú ag seasamh in aghaidh gach cas.

Ní chiallaíonn sin go bhfuil tú mícheart, ar ndóigh, ach tá an dualgas ort a mhíniú cén fáth a raibh Hugo, i do chuid focal, " log agus saorga", áit a bhfaca go leor againn é mar d'éabhlóid álainn ar óige agus ar an meán nuair a bhí sé fós ina ghealt.

(Agus fiú amháin más rud é nach bhfuil sé, atá ag iarraidh siúl timpeall ag caitheamh leath-lámhaigh Banda-Cabhair? comhlán.) Is é fírinne an scéil, fuair mé go raibh Hugo ina chleachtadh ciallmhar sa fhalcaireacht, ag tosú óna fhánaí oscailte trí stáisiún traenach Pháras, rud a chuir i gcuimhne dom níos mó ná aon rud de chuid Robert Zemecis 'An Polar Express'. Murab ionann agus Mike D'Angelo, is lucht leanúna fada é, a thógann sé mar bhealach chun spás a bhunú agus an lucht féachana a spreagadh chun a n-anáil a choinneáil gan aithne mar cheantar ceamara a iniúchadh; ach nuair a bhíonn an spás á iniúchadh is raiceann slick, lonracha CGI, agus snámhann an ceamara go dícheallach trí gan aon chiall fhisiciúil go bhfuil an ceamara nó an timpeallacht ann i ndáiríre, go dtosaíonn an t-iniúchadh sin ag mothú cosúil le duine éigin eile ag breathnú ar fhíschluiche. Agus bhraith an chuid eile den scannán gan phróitéiní agus neamhréadúil dom, ó thaobh a shuíomh agus ó thaobh a scéal an-inmhithe, maduinnín.<br/><br/>Ní gá go mbeadh fadhb agam le timpeallachtaí monaraithe, stílithe sa scannán. Is breá liom Baz Luhman's a bheith chomh sprawling, go hiomlán saorga ar Pháras i Moulin Rouge, mar shampla, ach tá tuiscint ar a ridiculous féin ag an scannán, tuiscint ar ghreann faoi cé chomh d'aon ghnó atá sé ró-an barr. Ditto an stylist Jean-Pierre Jenet, go háirithe in Amélie (An dá Jenet agus Luhmann bhraith cosúil le tionchair amhairc láidir anseo). Fuair mé an tuiscint, áfach, go raibh Martin scorse dom a ghlacadh Hugo hiomlán dáiríre. Cé go bhfuil sé fós scéal eile thar a bheith sentimental faoi mharcaigh a thabhairt dath ar ais isteach i saol an chuisle d'aois. Agus ní raibh mé in ann ach an dath a thabhairt ar ais isteach i saol an drumóg.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Níl rud ar bith taitneamh a bhaint as mé níos mó i scannán ná a bheith ionadh., Agus níl aon rud agam a chur ina cheart agus seasamh níos mó ná a ionramháil go follasach, a bheith os ard cad a bhraitheann agus nuair a bhraitheann sé é. Déanann scannán maith an cineál seo rud go subtly; úsáideann droch-cheann leideanna ceoil crashing agus teaghráin milis - agus sa chás seo, grubby, ollmhór-eyed, dílleachta disveled starring go maith ag an ceamara - chun grianghraif a éileamh, agus a insint don lucht féachana go bhfuil siad daoine Uafásach más rud é nach bhfuil siad ag freastal ar sé suas ar éileamh. É sin ráite, is féidir liom déileáil le páistí brónach agus daoine fásta grumpy a dhéanamh níos fearr dá chéile - dug mé i ndáiríre an saol i mbliana ar Le Havere, a bhí go bunúsach ar an plota céanna gan an cuteness - ach teacht agam ar na timpeallachtaí saorga léiríonn go dona ar na mothúcháin saorga, agus a dhéanann gach ceann eile is cosúil go bhfuil níos mó falsa ag casadh.<br/><br/>Chun tús a chur leis sin, i ár scannáin a ndearnadh dearmad orthu, ghlac tú féin agus Noel araon Keith a chur de chúram ar champing Tyrannosaur, mar gheall ar mhothaigh tú nach raibh sé réalaíoch go leor - ró-chreidiúnaíoch, ró-miorblist, i bhfad, ró-i bhfad. Cén chaoi a bhfuil sé indéanta nach féidir leat sean- crankstaithe a cheannach a bhriseann rudaí nuair a bhíonn sé feargach, ach is féidir leat a cheannach dílleachta atá ina gcónaí taobh istigh de tubaiste ollmhór agus dul ar thuras whimical a dheisiú uathoibriú mistéireach go gcreideann sé a d'fhéadfadh a bheith rúin as a athair marbh, ach ina ionad sin mar thoradh ar thuras quirky de féinfhionnachtay, isteach i dtír draíochta na pictiúrlainne? Níor tháinig tú riamh ar dhearadh racrócóideach Hugo, croí-phlucing ionsaitheach, nó ualach rothbarrow de quirk fiú beagán iomarcach nó deacair a swallow?<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Scott: Junet agus Luhman mar tionchair ar scorse?! Ná déan dearmad a bheith díomhaoin, anois tá tú ag púcáil dom le bata géar. Má tá tú ag lorg inspioráidí do Hugo-go, go deimhin, má tá tú ag lorg an croí mhothúchánach Hugo- caithfidh tú dul ar ais go dtí an scoil scorse ar Shráid Eilís i Little na hIodáile, i gcás ina buachaill beag plúchadh, in ann a imirt taobh amuigh leis na páistí eile, ar ais go dtí Alexander Korda fantasies cosúil leis an Thief Of Bagda. Nó, níos simplí, dul díreach go dtí an fhoinse féin: George Méliès, a bhfuil a Turas go dtí an Ghealach fós an Bang Mór de na fantasies cinematic go léir, an nóiméad sin nuair nach raibh an ceamara a úsáidtear chun doiciméad an domhan mar atá sé, ach is cuma cad láimhe, draíochta, ag iompar áit scannánóir ba mhaith leis a chumadh dó. Agus forbraíodh agus leathnaíodh an traidisiún sin ar feadh na mblianta sular thaitin sé le Jeanne agus Luhman, fuair siad a lapaí beaga grubby air.<br/><br/>Agus ag labhairt di ar Jenet, iarracht deas a chur ar shiúl mo arm reitriceach, ach beidh mé a rá sé ar aon nós: Conas is féidir leat grá Amélie, ach teacht ar Hugo sintéiseach agus " iomarcach" agus "lámhach". Deir tú go bhfuil Amélie agus Moulin Rouge a fhuascailt "tuiscint [] ridiculousness féin" nuair a Ciallaíonn scorse dúinn a ghlacadh Hugo dáiríre, agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an cás, ar a laghad, ar an bpointe sin. Go mothaíonn Scórse paisean soiléir faoi na scannáin, is dóigh liom, cén fáth gur mhaith leat a léirmhíniú Hugo mar féin-tromchúiseach.Ach domsa, tá sé na mothúcháin a thabhairt ar an scannán ballasta mhothúchánach nach bhfuil ag na scannáin Luhman agus Jenet. Baineann gach ceann de na trí scannán úsáid ionsaitheach an marvels de CGI - agus cuireann scorse 3D leis an meascán, go éifeacht iontach - ach áit a bhfuil tú, agus tá mé difriúil ar an tsaincheist gile. Aontaím go bhfuil éifeacht scaradh ag CGI; tá saol atá comhdhéanta go hiomlán de phlaisteach digiteach solúbtha go dtí an pointe nach bhfuil aon láithreacht acu uaireanta. Thagair tú do Hugo i do iontráil " Overrated" le haghaidh ár píosa Scannán is Fearr mar "GIG gimac" - adis foirfe... le haghaidh scannán eile.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Tá sé cóir a rá go bhfuil Hugo tógtha timpeall ar shaincheist chaighdeánach, ‘cúpláil croí-phlugáil’ leabhar / plota scannán do leanaí: Chailleann an dílladh a dhaidí, cruthaíonn sé a dhomhan fantaisíochta beag féin, lámhainní ar chara nua, go gcuireann sé ina luí ar daingean sean-duddy a mhaolú agus b’fhéidir é a ghlacadh. Ach sin díreach an cnámharlach scéal, agus soláthraíonn scorse neart feola agus fola. Maidir le ceann amháin, ní féidir leat féachaint ar Hugo, an buachaill uaigneach, ag teacht amach as túir clog go dtí an stáisiún traenach i bPáras gan smaoineamh ar Scorse, buachaill uaigneach eile, ag stánadh amach as a fhuinneog seomra leapa ar Shráid Elizabeth. Agus fiú más rud é nach bhfuil tú nerd scannán mór a dhéanamh ar an nasc sin, is dóigh liom i ndáiríre nach bhfuil turas Hugo i aimsiú figiúr athair nua, ach i gcónaí leis an draíocht meicniúil a sheasann mar oidhreacht a athair féin. Sin an scannán: Is é an buanseasmhacht fís a ligeann dúinn glacadh le leagan maisithe den domhan ag 24 fráma in aghaidh an tsoicind eolaíocht agus draíocht ag an am céanna. Ní bhaineann caidreamh Hugo le Méliès leis a bheith cluthar suas le daidí nua, ach a roinnt díograis choitianta go bhfuil an sean-fhear báite i searbhness. Chun mé, sin uillinn i bhfad níos uathúil ar áitreabh a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ann.<br/><br/>An raibh tú i ndáiríre a fháil ar aon cheann de Hugo enchanting?, Is cosúil go fiú an scannán haisteoirí beag toilteanach a admháil go raibh na seicteachas stair an phictiúrlann agus stiúideo Méliès 's' - le Michael Stuhlbar mar an scoláire scannán heroic!-a bhí terrific. Bhraith sé, ar an mbealach is fearr is féidir, cosúil le comhbhrú trom de mo rang Stair Scannán 101 sa choláiste, ag smaoineamh ar fiú seimeastar gearrthóga agus comhthéacs a thabhairt i rud éigin idir cruinniú agus leabhar beoite aníos. Agus labhraíonn sé leis an dearadh ingenious ar an scannán, a sraitheanna fíricí agus Fantasy chomh hálainn go bhfuil sé ag an am céanna stair na Méliès agus breith na pictiúrlainne, agus díreach an saghas simplí, a tháirgtear go hiontach cinematic go mbeadh grá Scorse féin mar leanbh. Go raibh maith agat Hugo ní leanúint ar an múnla Jenet / Luhmann agus tá "tuiscint ar a chuid ridiculous féin". Mar connoisseur Fantasy féin, ní ba mhaith leat a rá go bhfuil luach i imirt air díreach agus earnest agus unwashed seachas winking ag an lucht féachana?Is féidir leat teacht Hugo silky milis, ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an barántúlacht a meon atá le dhiúltú.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Tasha: Is ea, rinne mé i ndáiríre teacht ar chodanna de Hugo enchanting. (Fógra conas tá mé ag freagairt do cheist suas chun tosaigh, ach bhí tú frighting ró-ghnóthach le hasplexy chun aghaidh a thabhairt mianach, cé go glacadh mé go bhfuil freagra ina cheart féin. Ceart go leor, d'fhéadfadh "tionchar" a bheith ró-mhór ar an gcás - chiallaigh mé díreach tar éis an stíl amhairc d'fhéach sé an-eolach. Cé gur mar a luaigh Keith amach nuair a thug tú é seo suas go pearsanta, ní chuirtear scorse in aghaidh inspioráid a tharraingt ó amhairc daoine eile, ná imdhíonach dó.) Go príomha, bhí mé enchanted ag na codanna déileáil leis Georges Méliès' backstory, lena ghrá na pictiúrlainne, leis an obair a chuir sé isteach ar a chuid ealaíne agus an-áthas a fuair sé amach as é. Tá go leor áilleachta agus spraoi uafásach ag dul ar stáitse na háite faoi uisce ó "Fairliès" "Fairyland," agus san ord ag an deireadh, ag díriú ar scannánaíocht Méiliès. Deonóidh mé duit gur teagmháil deas é nasc Hugo le Méliès thar grá roinnte scannáin.Agus bainim taitneamh as scannán maith faoi scannánú.<br/><br/>Ach Hugo nach bhfuil go príomha faoi scannán, in ainneoin an Méliès cheangal-orlach., Chomh maith leis na téamaí a luaigh tú, tá sé freisin mar gheall ar a aimsiú do chuspóir, mar na carachtair go sainráite, a mhíniú go forleathan ar a chéile agus a chur chugainn. Agus tá sé faoi spéaclaí, agus píosaí gníomhaíochta mór, agus chases, agus go sona sásta-fear tar éis críochnú nuair a fiú an bullly feargach agus an lánúin níos sine cúthail agus ferwakskes fiú an dachs cranky dachud go léir a fháil péireáilte amach le a fheictear leasanna grá ag an deireadh. Tá sé mar gheall ar an Super-fhlaithiúil Hermione Granger-cineál a bheith bossy agus perky agus cliste agus a mholadh an saol draíochta clúdaithe i leabhair., Agus tá gach ceann de an gnó seo eolas mighty, agus saorga mighty.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Is ea, tá scorse ag imirt le hailtirí.Is é an fhadhb, níor mhothaigh mé riamh iad le haon rud nua, úr nó inchreidte, in ainneoin a chuid backstory féin. Ba mhaith liom a bheith i bhfad fearr scéal mar gheall ar óg scorse ag fás suas le plúchadh-ar scála beag agus fíor, gan seomraí ollmhór iomlán de CGI clockwork agus órga glowing deannaigh-motes agus prophetic aisling agus a raging do dhaoine fásta tyrant-garda le croí de óir-go léir asbhainte, thar an-barr nonsense. Coinníonn tú cúlra pearsanta agus grá an scannáin scoránaigh mar fhianaise go bhfuil sé ag mothú i ndáiríre cad atá sé a chur ar an scáileán, ach ní dóigh liom a dteagmháil pearsanta in aon cheann de seo, ach amháin na chuimhneacháin atá go sainráite faoi scannán. D'fhéadfadh na mothúcháin lárnacha a bheith fíor, ach ní dhéanann sin an forghníomhú níos lú bréagach.<br/><br/>Deir tú nach bhfuil an barántúlacht an emotion a dhiúltú. Ní féidir liom ceist cé acu a mhothaigh scorse go pearsanta uaigneach agus leithscartha mar leanbh, ach ní bhraitheann mé uaigneas agus leithlis ar an scáileán - feicim a bunch de chomharthaí maolaitheacha (Hugo bhfuil salach agus a chuid éadaí caite agus tá na daoine fásta go léir yell air agus faigheann sé eagla go rialta air le madra scary!) agus beats móra, le scairt agus weeping agus Spielbergian wonder-mothú. Maidir liom féin, tá sincerity níos diongbháilte agus níos pearsanta nuair a bhíonn sé ciúin agus go díreach; nuair a bhíonn duine ag shouting a chuid tuairimí ag dom, glacadh leis go bhfuil sé ceachtar feargach i ndáiríre, nó díreach ag iarraidh a dhéanamh mo céadfaí a choinneáil ó chur in iúl mo thuairim féin. Bhí Hugo ar aon eachtra fada, chomh fada agus a bhí imní orm.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Cén fáth nach bhfuair mé an mothú sin ar fhalscaireacht ó Amélie, iarrann tú? I ndáiríre, rinne mé. Admhóidh mé go hiomlán go bhfuil Amélie agus Moulin Rouge an dá chuid is mó, ionramháilte, tógálacha saorga sa vein chéanna cruinn, éilitheach mothúcháin ar leith ag eatraimh ar leith, agus ag iarraidh a dhíol leis na mothúcháin le emotion trom agus fuaimrian a tháirgeadh ionsaitheach. Níor dhíol ceachtar acu orm i ndáiríre ar a gcuid mothúchán mar mothú daonna barántúla. Ba é an rud a thaitin liom sa dá scannán sin ná an tógáil - go háirithe ceann ceannach Aélie, liostaí inléite de ghnéithe agus de thaithí tréithe randamacha ag baint leis an gcaitheamh, agus de bhrí go raibh muiní ceoil agus aithrisí ag Moulin Rouge. Tá mé a dhíol go minic ar scéalta a dhéanamh rudaí cruthaitheach nó uaillmhianach le struchtúr, agus an dá de na scannáin a bheith cáilithe, i gcás Hugo tá i bhfad níos mó líneach, caighdeánach kid-quest.<br/><br/>Ach sa deireadh, dom, a dhéanann sé i ndáiríre a thagann síos go dtí mothú go bhfuil na scannáin go maith, ach Hugo tá i gceist a ghlacadh dáiríre ag gach nóiméad go fírinneach. Ní dóigh leat go bhfuil fíor - ach tá tú ag cosaint an am céanna a sláine i dtéarmaí a mothúcháin go hiomlán barántúla, fréamhaithe i-Soscóróis, agus ag insint dom Tá mé mícheart, agus ní chiallaíonn sé é a ghlacadh dáiríre. Cén chaoi a réitíonn tú an dá ráiteas sin? Cad mar gheall ar an scannán a thugann le fios duit nach bhfuil sé i gceist glacadh ag aghaidhluach? Agus is féidir é seo a dhéanamh ach Cás Aisteach eile de Cnaipe Benjamin mar staid ina bhfaighim úsáid na bpáistí i scannáin mór-bhuiséada chun a bheith an-sásta agus melodramatic, ach mar a fhaigheann tú daidí ag seachaint do chiníochas agus go dtéann sé díreach chuig do mhothú teaghlaigh?<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Scott: Ní cinnte i gceist agam nach gciallaíonn scorse a ghlacadh dáiríre; tá sé díreach go bhfuil sé roghnaithe feithicil whimical trína bhfuil grá tromchúiseach de na scannáin a chur in iúl. Nuair a deir tú, "Ach Hugo nach bhfuil go príomha faoi scannán, in ainneoin an Méliès tie-orlach," Tá mé mystified. Deonaím go bhfaighidh tú go leor gnéithe de Hugo ró-eolas agus saothair agus iomlán de smaoineamh-rudaithe Spielbergian-níl aon rud is féidir liom a dhéanamh chun argóint a dhéanamh faoin dearcadh sin, a roinneann amhras Hugo eile. Uaireanta ciallaíonn scannán a charm agus draíocht, agus nach ndéanann sé do roinnt; tá tú fuair Hugo agus tá mé fuair Amélie, cé go mo thuairimse, an dara, d'aon ghnó saorga mar atá sé, ciallaíonn dúinn a fháil sé rómánsúil. (seachas, a rá, roinnt brabúsach meicniúil uafásach oiriúnach le haghaidh Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>Ach a rá nach bhfuil Hugo go príomha faoi scannán?, Más rud é nach bhfuil sé faoi scannán, ansin tá sé an chuid is mó pointlessious scéal faoi [cibé rud a cheapann tú tá sé faoi] atá feicthe agam riamh. Is é an caidreamh idir Hugo agus Méliès croílár an scannáin, agus ag croílár ní hamháin nasc stoic idir an Dílleachta Plucky agus Crusty Old Guy Le Croí Ó Óir, ach cleamhnas roinnte le haghaidh draíocht innealtóireachta - go sonrach le draíocht na scannáin. I mo thuairimse, tá Scrúdaí agus a chomhoibritheoirí a fuair ar bhealach a chur in iúl a ndíograis thar laethanta tosaigh na pictiúrlainne trí Fantasy atá inrochtana do gach aois.Is é scéal na bpáistí ar fad a líonadh ar an gcrust amháin anseo; is é pictiúrlann an pie. (mmmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Maidir leis an Cás Aisteach de Benjamin Button, ní fheicim mórán de nasc, seachas iarracht mé a nochtadh mar chosantóir Cnaipe Benjamin mar bhealach chun dochar a dhéanamh do mo chreidiúnacht. (Go teagmhasach, conas atá na rudaí breise ar an G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra Blu-ray?) Dúirt mé leat go raibh an daidí nua-scartha dom leochaileach le Benjamin Button, ach ní féidir liom a shamhlú am nuair a bheadh an t-áitreabh ag dul in aois ar ais ag bogadh dom. (Ag déileáil le grá do shaol i do airm mar naíonán? Conas nach féidir leat difear ag sin?) Agus sa bhreis, ní féidir liom a fheiceáil conas a bhaineann Benjamin Button le go leor chun Hugo mar scannán a bhaineann le páistí, ós rud é go bhfuil ach píosa beag de scéal go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó trajectory.<br/><br/>Mar sin, tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil tú? Ach tá mé sásta a fhoghlaim nach raibh Hugo hiomlán devoid de dhraíocht duit., Is iad na seicní ar Méliès an scannán déantóir cad a chur Hugo os do dom-agus i sin, ar a laghad, is féidir linn a roinnt grá scannán.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, ní féidir liom a rá go bhfuil tú cinnte dom, aon níos mó ná mé cinnte tú., Tá sé dodhéanta a mhaíomh duine ar bith i ngrá amhairc de rud ar bith, agus ba chóir é a bheith i ndáiríre chomh dodhéanta chun labhairt le duine éigin síos ó grá visceral. Den chuid is mó, tá tú in iúl dom a fheiceáil Hugo i Scott-O-Fís, ar taithí spéisiúil é; ar a laghad anois táim cinnte go láidir nach raibh an t-ainm agus an stiúrthóir céanna againn ar bhealach éigin.<br/><br/>Is cinnte go raibh taithí dhifriúil againn, áfach, agus d’intinn, dírithe ar ghnéithe éagsúla den táirgeadh: Ní fheicim fós an téama "scannán iontach" mar shnáithe amháin an scannáin, an oiread agus ceann i measc an iomarca. Clúdaíonn "Pointely dioscúr" beagnach é, cé gur mhaith liom caith i "go minic cutey gan ghá agus luachmhar" ar a bharr sin. Cé go bhfuil tú dírithe ar líonadh pie blasta an scannáin, is dóigh liom go raibh an pie clúdaithe le punt siúcra criostalaithe, agus is dóigh liom go ndéanann difríocht, beag beann ar phríomhtheachtaireacht an scannáin nó ar láimhseáil na radharcanna terrific. Féach freisin Benjamin Button, nach raibh mé ag tabhairt suas ach a charm leat - Sílim go bhfuil níos mó de streak sentimental ná mar a dhéanann mé maidir le leanaí sa phictiúrlann, go háirithe nuair a bhíonn siad ag úsáid níos mó mar siombailí de leochaileacht agus neamhchiontachta ná mar carachtair daonna. Hey, tá a fhios agat cad é an scannán go hiomlán nach bhfuil trealamh gleoite leathan-eyed ag tabhairt súil le domhan ciniciúil? G.I Joe: An Rise Of Cobra.B'fhéidir go rachaidh mé ag breathnú ar na breiseáin Blu-ray.D'fhéadfainn roinnt plé-insulin a úsáid chun cúiteamh a dhéanamh ar binneas Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | Bhí súil agam go mbeadh mo iníon saor ó amanna deacra agus trioblóideacha": Mee's scéal mar dhídean Mam<br/><br/>Hope in Times na Géarchéime: Scéal Lá Máthair<br/><br/>le Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Cuala Mee go raibh na saighdiúirí ag teacht. Bhí a mac i seilbh agus go raibh sí rannpháirteach go mór leis an gcuid eile de na sráidbhailte a bhí ar siúl i dtreo na teorann Téalainnis-Burse, áit a raibh Oifig Ard-Choimisinéir na Náisiún Aontaithe le haghaidh Dídeanaithe (UNHCR). Bhí a fear céile i sráidbhaile eile a bhí ag rith sa treo eile, Mee fhoghlaim níos déanaí. Tar éis an tóir a bhí ag na saighdiúirí dar críoch, d'fhill Mee abhaile chuig a sráidbhaile beag i Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>Le linn 1997-2000, bhí Mé féin agus na mílte cosúil léi ina gcónaí faoi bhagairt leanúnach an fhoréigin ó shaighdiúirí na Burma. Bheadh go leor daoine a ghlacadh tearmann sealadach sa jungle, agus ar ais abhaile chuig a sráidbhaile tar éis saighdiúirí fhág an limistéar, ach é a dhéanamh ar fud arís laethanta ina dhiaidh sin. Maidir uair sa tseachtain, bheadh Mise agus daoine eile ar an aistriú chun gabháil, éigniú, nó bás a sheachaint ag saighdiúirí.<br/><br/>Le linn eachtra amháin, rith fear céile Mee chun tosaigh ar a bhean chéile chun bia a dhaingniú dá theaghlach. D’éirigh an piléar as cuid dá ribeacht, agus fágadh go dona é agus saacair é agus chuaigh sé i dtreo an jungle lena theaghlach ar mhaithe le sábháilteacht.<br/><br/>Ar feadh trí mhí, chuir fear céile Mee i bhfolach agus bhog sé an teaghlach le créachta in iúl ar a thaobh. Ní bhfuair sé aon chúram leighis, ach amháin nuair a bhí sé ag críochnú Mee.<br/><br/>Bhí eagla orm filleadh ar Burma," a dúirt Mee trí ateangaire “Fhaed mé ag fáil bháis.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Creideann lucht tacaíochta gur próiseas seachas beartas iontrála níos mó é gníomh dearfach. Glacann na coláistí agus na hollscoileanna an tionscnamh breise le baint amach do ghrúpaí mionlaigh, rud a spreagann iad le cur i bhfeidhm.

Mar sin féin, creideann opponents gníomhaíochta dearfach go bhfuil an t-am tagtha chun deireadh a chur le gníomh dearfach.

It was the first total solar eclipse in the continental U.S. since<br/>1979, and the first transcontinental total solar eclipse, in which the eclipse's path<br/>goes coast to coast, in 99 years.<br/><br/>For April Hiscox, associate professor in the Department of Geography, the eclipse<br/>enhanced her research of the Earth's near atmosphere, the layer that extends from earth's surface to about a half-mile high. For physics<br/>and astronomy professor Timir Datta, it was a moment for recreating a famous 1919 experiment that helped confirm Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. And for Adam<br/>Hartstone-Rose, associate professor in the School of Medicine and adjunct scientist<br/>at Riverbanks Zoo, it was an opportunity to study odd animal behavior.<br/><br/>Studio art professor and researcher Chris Robinson connected art and science through his<br/>unique Southern Lights laser installation, which debuted on Sat., Aug. 19. The large-scale installation, which will span the Congaree River near the Blossom Street Bridge, is planned for<br/>future long-term display so more visitors can enjoy the unique laser-beam experience.<br/><br/>An Epic Event Schedule<br/><br/>Being home to the longest period of total eclipse on the East Coast was significant.<br/>That's why, throughout the city, you could enjoy a galaxy of eclipse-related events<br/>in the days leading up to the main event. The University of South Carolina Columbia<br/>Campus hosted a number of free, public programs beginning on Aug. 17.<br/><br/>On Fri., Aug. 18, solar physicist Dr. Sarbani Basu, Department of Astronomy Chair at Yale University, discussed the history of solar<br/>eclipses and what humankind has learned from them in a public lecture.<br/><br/>On Sun., Aug. 20, visitors to campus took part in a series of free, 30-minute talks<br/>by USC faculty and visiting scholars Ramesh Kapoor, Gerardo Vazquez, James Overduin and Kristin Simunac.<br/><br/>Held at Swearingen Engineering Center, the series hosted experts who discussed the role of eclipses in science and society, and how eclipses have factored in myths<br/>and legends throughout history.<br/><br/>Visitors to Spirit Communications Park on eclipse day were invited to explore the Degrees of Health with UofSC at the iMAGINE STEM Festival. This full day of fun included interactive STEM exhibits (science, technology, engineering<br/>and math) from UofSC and other organizations. Tickets also included the 1:05 p.m.<br/>Columbia Fireflies vs. Rome Braves game and Total Eclipse of the Park.<br/><br/>For those who preferred to beat the heat and watch the eclipse inside, we offered<br/>live stream viewing of NASA TV's Eclipse Megacast in several areas across the Columbia Campus.<br/><br/>A variety of experts visited locations across campus to share how eclipses are woven<br/>into our science, culture, history and art. Allison Marsh, Steven Rodney, Michael Weisenburg, Scott White, Varsha Kulkarni, Nate Carnes and Zhenlong Li each hosted 20-minute public discussions leading up to the eclipse.<br/><br/>The Department of Physics and Astronomy operated 10 outdoor and 5 indoor viewing stations across campus with telescopes, activities and/or NASA live video streams. Viewers<br/>could choose their eclipse experience with access to expert discussions and telescopic technology<br/>or fun activities such as disc golf and family-friendly crafts.<br/><br/>USC's Naturalist-in-Residence Rudy Mancke visited viewers on the historic Horseshoe to share the nature of the solar eclipse,<br/>leading up to the 2.5 minutes of totality beginning at 2:41 pm.<br/><br/>After the sun fully re-emerged, the university hosted an Eclipse Reception for rising high school seniors and upcoming graduate students.<br/><br/>In the late afternoon, the Darla Moore School of Business hosted a free, public talk<br/>by Dr. Craig Roberts, a distinguished professor and senior physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, one<br/>of the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratories for science and engineering<br/>research. In his "Laying the God Particle to Rest" discussion, Dr. Roberts discussed Higgs Boson and why it cannot be used to identify<br/>the source of more than 98 percent of the universe's visible mass.<br/><br/>The big day finally came to a close at Williams Brice Stadium where visitors could<br/>enjoy the university's gridiron stars. An open practice of the 2017 Gamecock football team was the perfect ending to a phenomenal day.<br/><br/>Highlighting History<br/><br/>Campus visitors could mingle alongside eclipse experts and everyone near and far was invited to share in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Learn<br/>more about how we welcomed this historic event:<br/><br/>NASA Official Viewing Location<br/><br/>We were honored to be named an Official Viewing Location by NASA. Viewers at our 15 on-campus<br/>viewing stations enjoyed access to eclipse-related experts and other educational opportunities<br/>while safely enjoying the solar eclipse. | Uirlisí<br/><br/>Acmhainní:<br/><br/>Ó réalteolaíocht go dtí an stair,<br/><br/>bhí againn dearcadh taobh istigh de na eclipse 2017.<br/><br/>iomlán eclipse<br/><br/>Bhí Columbia, SC ar cheann de na háiteanna is fearr chun taithí a fháil ar na chéad eclipse gréine uile chósta Mheiriceá ó 1918.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Comhcheangail<br/><br/>Tá cosaintí i gcoinne Punch, freagraí plódaithe le cineálacha éagsúla ionsaithe.Tá go leor ainmneacha acu ar fud na n-ealaíon comhraic ach (i mo thaithí) tá leagan acu ar gach ealaín. Fágann sé sin go bhfuil siad difriúil ná foirmeacha toisc go bhfuil neart na n-ealaíon comhraic nach bhfuil foirmeacha ar bith acu. Cén fáth a chleachtadh freagra ar leith nuair (i ndáiríre) uainiú, cineál ionsaí, méid an ionsaí, agus beidh céad fachtóirí eile a dhéanamh, mar sin ní bheidh tú ag úsáid riamh go bhfuil freagra choragrafaithe ar fad? Agus ar deireadh, conas is féidir linn a chleachtadh ar feadh staid cosanta fíor agus gortú a sheachaint ag an am céanna?<br/><br/>Is é an uilíocht na teaglamaí go hiontach, a rá an ceann is lú., Tá ár stíl de Kenpo Karate liosta de 108 combos is féidir a fhoghlaim. (Bíonn an chuid is mó de na mic léinn ag foghlaim 20-30 áfach) Sa Bhrasaíl Jiu-Jitsu chaitheann tú ranganna iomlán ag cleachtadh barraí lámh agus chokes, ag foghlaim gach subtle chun an t-aistriú cé go dtugann do pháirtí beag gan aon fhriotaíocht. Tá gach Boxer chaith uair an chloig i os comhair an mála agus / nó scáthán throwing an meascán céanna de punches go dtí go mbogann a gcorp ag reflux ina n-aonar. Tá comhcheangail uilíoch toisc nach bhfuil aon bhealach níos fearr againn gluaiseacht a thabhairt isteach agus ansin na poist caolchúiseacha a theastaíonn chun iad a dhéanamh ag obair. Ag bualadh pointe brú beag trí éadaí a thógann A lán de chleachtas, a ghabháil le barra lámh le rialú é a chur go cúramach agus a shocrú sneaky, agus tá meascán mór úsáideach ach amháin más féidir leat tríd é ó phost cothrom agus faoi chosaint. An féidir leat smaoineamh ar bhealach níos fearr a fháil ar na scileanna?<br/><br/>Tá aon líon fachtóirí ann a chinneann conas a fhreagraíonn tú d'ionsaí agus cibé acu i gcluiche earraigh nó i gcomhrac, níor úsáid mé meascán iomlán i mo chosaint.Cén fáth, ansin, an gcaithimid uaireanta ag cleachtadh iad? Déanaimid na freagraí grafála seo a chleachtadh toisc nach bhfuil an cuspóir chun teaglaim a tharraingt amach 8 gach uair a fheiceann tú Punch hook ach chun bealach amháin a thaispeáint duit chun é a bhlocáil agus ansin bealach féideartha chun é a leanúint suas. Níor roghnaigh mé riamh teaglaim a úsáid 3 i ndáiríre ach tá an bloc ar cheann de mo go leor bogadh.Cuireann comhcheangail uirlisí leis an mbosca uirlisí nach socraíonn siad an carr.<br/><br/>Is ceist sábháilteachta í an cheist dheireanach.Má chleachtaimid ar mhaithe le réaltacht a mhacasamhlú.Conas a chuirimid cosc ar dhíobháil agus muid ag déanamh amhlaidh?Nuair a thagann sé síos dó, baineann sé le muinín a thógáil. Táimid ag tosú mall agus ag foghlaim le muinín a bheith againn go bhfuil smacht againn orainn féin. Foghlaimímid chun muinín a bheith ag ár gcomhpháirtithe chomh maith.Le tuilleadh ama foghlaimímid muinín a bheith againn as ár smacht ar ár gcomhpháirtí agus (gearrthóir beag) foghlaimímid chun muinín a bheith againn as smacht ár gcomhpháirtí orainn. Sa deireadh (le go leor cleachtais) is féidir leat bogadh go hiomlán luas, tossing do pháirtí, agus a chaitheamh gan eagla ar ghortú.<br/><br/>Tá comhcheangail uilíoch ar chúis; déantar iad a chleachtadh ionas gur féidir iad a scaipeadh ina gcodanna, agus fanaimid sábháilte trí mhuinín mall agus tógáil a thosú. Mar aon le gach rud eile sna healaíona comhraic, tá go leor cúiseanna taobh thiar dá gcleachtas agus a fhorghníomhú. |
