| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Cudidtch trí na haoiseanna<br/><br/>Bhí mé ag déanamh roinnt rudaí a bhaineann le cuaddidch cosúil le broinsí agus sníití agus ní agus de chineál a iompú isteach seo a thiomsú corr rudaí, lena n-áirítear Harry síos ann ag bun an leathanaigh. Níl mé sásta go hiomlán leis an mbealach a tháinig sé amach, ach ós rud é nach bhfuil sé olc do mo dara pictiúr Harry Potter lucht leanúna-ealaín, chinn mé a dath ar aon nós. Má tá tú ag smaoineamh i gcás ina bhfuil a scar, tá sé ann, ach tá sé an-éadrom agus beag mar rinne mé go bhfuil beagán ar an ríomhaire. |

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend.

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Cosaint an gheimhridh le haghaidh Crainn Fig<br/><br/>Tuarascáil ar an Airteagal seo<br/><br/>Cosaint an gheimhridh le haghaidh Crainn Fig<br/><br/>Forbhreathnú<br/><br/>Tá an crann fige thart ó 5,000 B.C. ar a laghad, agus fástar é ar fud an domhain mar gheall ar a thorthaí blasta.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | Tagann Oculus POF síos go crua ar thacaíocht Mac don Riff<br/><br/>Níor chuir Oculus POF, Palmer Lucky, bac ar a chuid focal nuair a iarrtar é in agallamh an mbeidh an headset VR Rift riamh ag tacú leis an Mac.Má bhí súil agat go raibh sé go luath, b'fhéidir gur mhaith leat tú féin a réidh le haghaidh díomá éigin.<br/><br/>Más rud é go scaoilfidh siad ríomhaire maith riamh, déanfaimid é.<br/><br/>Cad tá sé ag tagairt do ann i tuiscint níos lú taidhleoireachta is é an grafaicí scoite is gá a reáchtáil ar an Rift.Is í an fhírinne simplí ná nach dtéann Apple díreach le haghaidh grafaicí ard-deireadh a chomhlíonfaidh na riachtanais don headset. Maidir le comhthéacs, ar ríomhaire Windows, is gá duit ar a laghad cárta grafaicí NVIDIA GTX 970, cárta grafaicí $ 300.<br/><br/>Mar a chuaigh Lucky ar aghaidh a rá:<br/><br/>Ní chuireann sé ach boils síos ar an bhfíric nach dtugann Apple tosaíocht do GPUanna ard-deireadh.Is féidir leat a cheannach $6,000 Mac Pro le barr an líne AMD FirePro D700, agus ní chuireann sé fós ár n-specs molta a mheaitseáil. Mar sin, má thugann siad tosaíocht do GPUanna ard-deireadh mar a úsáidtear iad ar feadh tamaill ar ais sa lá, ba bhreá linn tacú le Mac. Ach anois, níl ach meaisín amháin amuigh ansin a thacaíonn leis.<br/><br/>Ní féidir leis an Mac Pro a chur ina chúis nach bhfuil pacáil neart capall, toisc go ndéanann sé, ach chomh maith céanna FirePro grafaicí atá dírithe níos mó i dtreo an margadh cruthaitheach, díreach cosúil leis an Mac Pro. An Mac Pro i bhfad níos mó ná riachtanais crua-earraí eile, ach go nádúrtha mar go bhfuil an Rift grafaicí trom, is é seo an áit a bhfuil an easpa. Tá an t-ádh beagán os cionn an bharr, ach go cothrom tá sé an fear taobh thiar den Rift, mar sin níl aon amhras neart na fírinne leis an méid a deir sé., Fiú amháin más rud é nach bhfuil sé ag rá go bhfuil sé go maith.<br/><br/>Cad a deir tú, úinéirí Mac an domhain?

Agus Oculus Rift Tacaíonn is cinnte meaisíní Linux a chomhlíonann a gcuid sonraíochtaí crua-earraí! (Níl an cheist OS ach crua-earraí.)<br/><br/>Chomh maith leis sin, féach ar WHY tacaíonn an Vive HTC X: tá níos mó dá crua-earraí féin ann. (Cén fáth go gcosnaíonn sé an oiread sin.) Na réitigh Oculus - an Rift agus an VR Samsung - a cheangal ar an crua-earraí go bhfuil sé ag plugging isteach chun níos mó de na ardú trom.<br/><br/>Ní gimmick é VR. Ní thugann teilifíseáin 3D an oiread sin d'éifeacht 3D, agus ní oibríonn sé le gach duine.Oibríonn VR le gach duine, agus níl aon latency ag na táirgí scaoilte oifigiúla Oculus agus HTC Vive mar sin níor chóir go mbeadh aon tinneas gluaisne ann.

Ní fhéadfaidh siad na cluichí uimhreacha a bhuachan i dtéarmaí specs, is annamh a dhéanann siad, ach is annamh a bhíonn aithne ag mórchuid na ndaoine a thugann aire don taighde ar an bhfeidhmíocht sin!= suim chodanna an fheiste.Is féidir le Apple níos mó a dhéanamh le "níos lú". Ar pháipéar a gcuid táirgí le feiceáil níos lú ach nuair a chomhlíonann crua-earraí cothrom go sonrach bogearraí a innealtóireacht siad go ginearálta chomh maith leis an gcomórtas más rud é nach bhfuil a dhéanamh amach.<br/><br/>HA! Is breá liom conas, níl gach ceann de ríomhaire ardfheidhmíochta go tobann, a bhfuil ríomhaire ardfheidhmíochta tábhachtach do phans Apple!Níl Mac amháin in ann na grafaicí deiridh is airde a cheannach.Ní féidir leis ceann a thógáil. Níl Mac in ann a bheith ar an airde i bhfeidhmíocht agus tá tú go maith leis sin. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>Cheannaigh mé mo MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 mar gheall ar an scáileán ardtaifigh agus an GPU neamh-discréideach.Mar sin féin, do mo dheasc thóg mé córas le monatóir 4K, i4790K LAP, 3 GTX 970 GPU, agus 16 gb de chuimhne ar fad ar feadh níos lú ná an méid ba mhaith liom a íoc le haghaidh iMac. Tá mé fiú SSD ar bun chun tosaithe i OX.Is é mo phointe Apple a dhéanamh rudaí den chineál céanna más mian leat, ach nach bhfuil.Go deimhin, breathnú ar an iMac is déanaí. Áirítear air grafaicí scoite agus tiomáint mall 5400 RPM. Ní fhéadfadh mo ríomhaire breathnú chomh deas, agus nach bhfuil sé chomh tanaí, ach sa deireadh tá sé níos úsáidí - nach bhfuil an fáth a cheannach againn ar ríomhaire sa chéad áit?<br/><br/>Ní féidir liom a fheiceáil cén fáth nach féidir le Mac pro úsáid a bhaint as an Oculus nach bhfuil sé tógtha le haghaidh rindreáil físeán.Tuigeann mé nach mbeidh sé in ann a reáchtáil ar iMac agus mar gheall ar seo ba chóir a bheith brandáilte d’úsáideoirí Pro mar gheall ar na riachtanais agus teacht ar an bpraghas.<br/><br/>Anois tá daoine ag rá go bhfuil do ríomhaire ag déanamh GACH an ardú trom, mar sin cén fáth go bhfuil an pointe praghais níos mó ná $ 800 do rud éigin nach bhfuil ag déanamh rud ar bith?<br/><br/>Tá mé ar bís faoi threoir VR ach ní cá bhfuil sé i láthair na huaire.<br/><br/>Ní dhéanann do taispeáint (a bhfuil an Rift) aon cheann de na ardaithe trom. Tá sé $ 800 mar gheall ar cad a dhéanann an taispeáint; 110 ° uillinn féachana (nach súile an duine fós níos gaire ná taispeántais eile) le latency Super íseal a laghdú nó deireadh a chur le tinneas tairiscint ar taispeáint 1200x1800 in aghaidh na súl ar chaighdeán HD.<br/><br/>Agus is ea, úsáidtear Mac an-leathan le haghaidh fís rindreáil, ach ní tharlaíonn rindreáil ag 30+fs.Féadann sé físuaireanta a thógáil chun fráma amháin a dhéanamh agus uaireanta blianta chun scannán iomlán a dhéanamh. Is é an táirge deiridh, nó an t-ábhar réamhthuartha, a thiocfaidh chun bheith 30+fs ansin.<br/><br/>Go raibh maith agat @TherealFixer<br/>A lán de na rudaí a dhéanann tú ciall agus cuid eile bhí mé aineolach de.<br/><br/>Buille faoi thuairim mé nach bhfuil mé a fheiceáil VR mar cluiche, ach mar tumoideachais agus ag féachaint ar Mac atá go maith ag 3dcad agus físeáin a thiomsú ba mhaith liom go mbeadh siad in ann a chur le chéile radharc go maith., Tá mé le feiceáil fiú 3d rindreáil de scannán ag siúl tríd. Ag cruthú domhan 3d agus ag cur ceamaraí i gceantair chun a fháil amach conas a bheadh radharc cuma<br/><br/>Ach aontaím ar Mac ar úsáid níos mó a bhaint as timthriallta LAP fiú trí úsáid a bhaint as ann GPU ar chun cabhrú leat., Leis sin dúirt go bhfuil treoracha eile a d'fhéadfadh ceann amháin a chur air.<br/><br/>Is é mo grip mór ar an bhfíric gur fhéachtar ar tháirge tomhaltóra.Má tá na ceanglais sin ard, ansin tá sé níos mó táirge táirge táirge agus ní mór é a fhógairt mar sin. Tuigim go bhfuil an teicneolaíocht ann ach nach mbraitheann sé go bhfuil táirge tomhaltóra ann.<br/><br/>Sea, tá tú ceart. Tá saincheisteanna ag Apple freisin le bogearraí. Níl an chuid is mó ag baint úsáide as "miotal" an teanga cláir úll a luasanna suas an phróiseáil le haghaidh cluichí toisc go bhfuil sé ina réiteach Apple ach amháin i gcás go leor innill cluiche a oibríonn ar Microsoft Direct X nó foinse oscailte Opengle a úsáideann an chuid is mó cluichí a reáchtáil ar Linux agus osSX. Tá Opengle thart ar 20% níos moille agus uaireanta go leor níos mó ná sin i gcomparáid le díreach x mar sin barr an chárta cearrbhachais líne ag rith i osSX chomh tapa agus is cárta cearrbhachais meánleibhéil i bhfuinneoga. Mar sin, fadhbanna mór gan trácht ar an chuid is mó macaí tógtha i gcártaí nach bhfuil aon uasghrádú acu.<br/><br/>Tá an mac pro chomh difriúil go mbeadh Apple é seo a dhéanamh mar ní fiú díoltóir cárta é seo a dhéanamh mar níl aon bhrabús ann dóibh leis an méid beag ceannaitheoirí féideartha a bheadh ann chuige seo. Ní maith le Apple airgead a chailleadh mar sin ní fheiceann mé é seo ag tarlú riamh.Mhódh Apple airgead ag tairiscint uasghrádú cárta físe ar son mac.<br/><br/>Bhuel tá sé pointe cé go bhfuil mé cúram faoi rift oculus, in áit fanacht starVR. Ba chóir go mbeadh rogha a chur níos fearr GPUs isteach i Mac agus MacBook Pro. Tá sé brónach freisin nach bhfuil níos mó cárta nVisa, thaitin liom an tacaíocht CUDA anois beidh orm ríomhaire a cheannach agus Linux a shuiteáil do mo thionscadail CUDA.<br/><br/>Is margadh atá ag fás agus ní bheidh sé fada go dtí go bhfuil fiú iPhones feidhmíocht níos mó GPU ná an Macs. Aontaím gur chóir do Apple deireadh ard a thairiscint GPU i Mac<br/><br/>Tá an-áthas orm faoin easpa grafaicí scoite ardfheidhmíochta ar ríomhairí Mac. Úsáideann fiú barr an deilbhín cosúil le GPU soghluaiste dáta nach féidir, ar ndóigh, a uasghrádú. Más mian liom bogearraí a fhorbairt le haghaidh VR, d’fhág Apple dom aon rogha ach ríomhaire a cheannach nó a thógáil chun é a rith.Mar lucht leanúna mór Apple (tá sé á admháil agam) déanann sé seo dochar dom.<br/><br/>Más rud é go bhfuil a fhios agat cad is ciall agam.Tá VR ag athrú go deo.Is é mo imní faoi VR go bhfuil sé ró-mhaith.Is é sin. Freagra D'fhéadfadh a bheith ann na milliúin daoine a bheith addicted chun cónaí agus ag imirt i saol fíorúil Féach ar cé mhéad daoine a fuair addicted le MMOs a bhí ar scáileán cothrom., Le VR bhraitheann tú i ndáiríre cosúil go bhfuil tú sa chluiche.<br/><br/>Níl mé buartha faoi rud ar bith, tá mé cinnte go mbeidh úll a chur i bhfeidhm féin le haghaidh Mac agus iOS nuair a bheidh ardteicneolaíochta a bheith réidh le haghaidh tomhaltóirí, ceart anois tá sé níos mó le haghaidh úsáideoirí hardcore. Cosúil le úll i gcónaí is maith leis an am a láithreacht ar dheis, le táirge ceart. Bíodh creideamh i úll.<br/><br/>Tá sé greannmhar go bhfuil a fhios ag a lán daoine cén vr atá bunaithe níos fearr ar ós tacaíocht., Buille faoi thuairim mé go raibh tú guys tástáil trom agus anois go bhfuil an Guy sa siopa leictreonach mór go bhfuil a fhios is fearr.<br/><br/>Dúirt HTC go dtabharfaidh sé tacaíocht don osx ach gur gá é sin a fheiceáil fós.<br/><br/>Tuigim go bhfuil go leor daoine agat stampáilte ar ann d*ks.Ach tuigim go bhfuil Apple níos dírithe ar ríomhairí glúine.Agus ní féidir ríomhairí glúine a phacáil le níos mó cumhachta ná ríomhaire, mar gheall ar mhéid, teas, tomhaltas cumhachta srl.<br/><br/>Tá sé ceart, cé chuir sé i **** * téarmaí., Is breá liom mo Mac ach Tiarna ní mór é a threisiú i grafaicí. Ní gá go mbeadh sé chun costas níos mó ach ba mhaith liom a bheith níos mó ná sásta a íoc beag breise le haghaidh cárta grafaicí níos fearr nó ar a laghad go mbeadh an rogha a shuiteáil mo chuid féin., Tá sé i ndáiríre ró-olc an Guy seo a dhéanamh a ráiteas fuaime mar tá sé ach plain uneducated. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Cad iad na Guys a dúirt 19<br/><br/>Níl, tá sé toisc go bhfuil táirgeoirí siamsaíochta agus margóirí táirgí ag iarraidh aisteoirí / aisteoirí agus samhlacha a bhfuil cuma an chuid is mó den lucht féachana orthu, ionas go mbeidh siad ábhartha agus dá bhrí sin uirlisí díolacháin níos éifeachtaí. Táim cinnte go bhfuil cuma iontach ar mhná na hÁise d’fhir na hÁise. Chun mé, mar fhear bán, níl aon achomharc acu.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Tá mé 100 faoin gcéad díreach. Ní féidir liom dul taobh amuigh de mo chine. Nuair a bhí mé ina shaighdiúir go raibh mé an "ghrá dom tú ar feadh i bhfad" taithí san Áise., D'fhág sin dom mothú míchompordach aon uair a bhfuil baineannaigh na hÁise in aice liom. Uaireanta táim thar a bheith míchompordach, cé nach ndearna na daoine áirithe aon rud chun é a fhiúntas. Le linn cuairt a thabhairt ar an Téalainn, fuair mé amach gurb é an t-aon bhealach chun cosc a chur orm féin a bheith á mholadh ar an tsráid ná bean bán a ghlacadh liom mar intinn.<br/><br/>Aha é an rud nach bhfuil go leor daoine bán (nó aon duine ar chor ar bith) sa tSín, ach in áiteanna 'bán', (nó ar a laghad Astráil) tá go leor de Asians timpeall ann, a rinne smaoineamh ar an gceist seo dom...<br/><br/>B’fhéidir i gcodanna den tír ina gcloíonn tú le (cuimhnigh, éin a bhfuil aithreacha orthu), díreach mar is cosúil go bhfuil formhór na ndaoine poblachtach etc. Cé nach féidir ach mionlaigh bheag a bheith ann.<br/><br/>Agus chomh fada agus is eol dom, tá a lán de na whites sa tSín, go príomha ag gnó, etc Ach tá sé simplí, an chuid is mó de na daoine tá na hÁise, mar sin is fearr leo cailíní na hÁise (madraí cosúil le madraí, cait mhaith, is fearr le daoine is mó a gcineál féin). Agus níl aon rud cearr leis sin.Tá an rud céanna i dtíortha bán.<br/><br/>I mo thuairimse, tá Asians an chuid is mó álainn. Ar an drochuair dom an 2 Fuair mé i gceist le mo shaol a bhí ag baint úsáide as dom le haghaidh mo áit / idirlíon i bhfad ó shin agus an ceann le déanaí a bhí ceann óir tochailt dúr bitch., Ní raibh sí céim riamh coláiste agus bhí 30. Ba mhaith liom a bheith thar a bheith sásta má bhuail mé le bean gleoite cliste na hÁise in aice le mo aois nach raibh a thochailt óir.<br/><br/>@Prettypathic yes mar nuair a loves fear domhain sé i gcónaí go maith leat ar an leaba is cuma méid tits nó dath craicinn agus fear fíor-urraim a thabhairt do cailín i gcónaí i ngach caidreamh cosúil le máthair, deirfiúr, bean chéile, chailín srl<br/><br/>Mar shamhail ón óige, thosaigh mé le cuideachta ar a dtugtar siúcra agus spíosraí. Earcaíodh mé sa tSeapáin agus bhí mo theaghlach luaite ann.<br/><br/>gheobhaidh tú post toisc go bhfuil siad ag dul le haghaidh cuma áirithe, a bhfuil siad ag díriú, agus an limistéar ina gcónaíonn tú.<br/><br/>Bhí orm an tionscal a fhágáil anuraidh mar gheall ar chúiseanna sláinte.
