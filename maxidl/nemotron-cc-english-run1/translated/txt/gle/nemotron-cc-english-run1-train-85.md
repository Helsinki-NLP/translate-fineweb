| New Officer Training<br/><br/>Event Overview<br/><br/>This four-day virtual training covers community-oriented policing, cultural responsiveness, the role of school-based officers, and an introduction to Law Related Education (LRE) as an essential prevention tool. Day 1 begins with Leadership 100, where SROs and JPOs will attend training with their administrator(s). Attending this training together encourages program cohesion and effective program implementation. Day 2 covers child development, trauma-informed practices, working with students in special education, and cultural responsiveness. Days 3 and 4 do a deep dive into LRE providing officers with classroom management techniques, space to share ideas and lesson plan, and knowledge of learning styles. Officers leave with resources and tools ready to teach in the classroom.<br/><br/>ThisOfficers NEW to the program in FY 2022 OR who joined the program in FY 2021 but did not attend the New Officer Training in FY 2021 OR who were not on the last grant cycle (FY18-FY20). | Oiliúint Oifigeach Nua<br/><br/>Forbhreathnú ar an imeacht<br/><br/>Clúdaíonn an oiliúint fhíorúil ceithre lá seo póilíneacht phobail-dhírithe, freagrúlacht chultúrtha, ról na n-oifigeach ar scoil-bhunaithe, agus réamhrá don Oideachas Dlí (LRE) mar uirlis riachtanach chun cosc a chur ar a chinntiú.

The ambiguity arises from the fact that static pressure can be used, correctly, to refer to the free-stream pressure in external flows, but it is more often, and not always correctly, used to refer to the pressure in a generic point of a flow field, typically when discussing the Bernoulli equation. In order to avoid ambiguity, alternative expressions that could be used, depending on the context, are free-stream pressure, fluid pressure, thermodynamic pressure or often just pressure.<br/><br/>Equivalence of static and free-stream pressure<br/><br/>We consider as an example the atmosphere, at rest relatively to the ground. An observer standing on the ground would see a generic fluid element as not moving, and subject to the local static pressure (which, in this case, is the atmospheric pressure).<br/>We now consider an aircraft that flies straight and level with speed (airspeed and ground speed are the same, in this example), approaching the same fluid element from great distance. The distance is such that the fluid element is not perturbed by the approaching aircraft. To an observer on board the aircraft, the fluid element, like all the fluid elements at the same distance, appears as being in free-stream conditions, where all the fluid elements flow straight towards the aircraft with the same constant velocity and there are no pressure gradients inside the fluid (that is the pressure is constant anywhere in that region of fluid).[4] Given that the fluid element is the same for both observers, so is the pressure to which the element is subject, therefore what an observer at rest calls static pressure is in fact the free-stream pressure to an observer moving relatively to the fluid. This is the only case in fluid dynamics where, strictly speaking, the expression static pressure can be used appropriately[citation needed], i.e. to refer to the free-stream pressure.<br/>Note that when the fluid element comes in proximity to the aircraft, free-stream conditions are lost, its velocity changes and pressure gradients develop. The pressure exerted on the element, therefore, will not be, in general, equal to the static pressure anymore.<br/><br/>Static pressure and the Bernoulli equation<br/><br/>The Bernoulli equation, assuming incompressible, inviscid flow and negligible gravitational effects, can be written as follows:<br/><br/>Since the term ρv2 / 2 is, by definition, the so-called dynamic pressure, the term p, by contrast, is usually named static pressure although it may, or may not, refer to the above mentioned free-stream pressure. The two possible cases are:<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to free-stream conditions – When the Bernoulli equation is applied to a point of the flow field far upstream of any object, both pressure and velocity take their respective free-stream values and , therefore the Bernoulli equation can be correctly read as "the sum of static pressure and (free-stream) dynamic pressure is constant across the flow field".<br/><br/>Bernoulli equation referred to a generic point – When the Bernoulli equation is written for a generic point A of the flow field, for example a point close to an airfoil, the value of the fluid pressure pA is in general different from the free-stream one, and, strictly speaking, the term should not be referred to as static pressure. The Bernoulli equation could be correctly read, for example, as "the sum of fluid pressure in A and dynamic pressure in A is constant across the flow field". Nevertheless it is very common to refer to the non-velocity-dependent term of the Bernoulli equation as static pressure anyway, regardless of whether it is applied to free-stream conditions or not.<br/><br/>The two cases can be summarized by applying the Bernoulli equation to different points of the flow field: a point far upstream, a generic point close to a body and, for completeness, a stagnation point on the body's surface:<br/><br/>where:<br/><br/>= free-stream (static) pressure<br/><br/>ρ = fluid density (assumed constant)<br/><br/>= free-stream velocity<br/><br/>p = fluid pressure in a generic point<br/><br/>v = velocity in a generic point<br/><br/>pS = stagnation (or total) pressure<br/><br/>See also<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>^ There are only a few areas (e.g. some parts of the fuselage or along the outside of a Pitot tube) where the pressure exerted is equal to the static pressure; those are the places where static ports are located.<br/><br/>^ A pressure gradient would in fact cause an acceleration, and so the velocity would not be constant anymore. Note also that we are neglecting the variation of atmospheric pressure with altitude. | Inneachar<br/><br/>Brú statach i ndinimic sreabhach<br/><br/>Tá úsáid an bhrú statach ar dhinimic sreabhach an-choitianta, cé go bhféadfadh débhríocht a bheith mar thoradh air. Eascraíonn an débhríocht as an bhfíric gur féidir brú statach a úsáid, i gceart, chun tagairt a dhéanamh don bhrú saor-sruthach i sreabha seachtracha, ach is minic a bhíonn sé níos minice, agus ní i gcónaí, a úsáidtear i gceart chun tagairt a dhéanamh don bhrú i bpointe cineálach de réimse sreafa, agus an chothromóid Bernolli á phlé de ghnáth. Chun débhríocht a sheachaint, is iad nathanna malartacha a d’fhéadfaí a úsáid, ag brath ar an gcomhthéacs, brú saorshrutha, brú sreabhán, brú teirmidinimiciúil nó díreach brú.<br/><br/>Comhionannas brú statacha agus saor-sruth<br/><br/>Measaimid mar shampla an t-atmaisféar, ar an taobh eile leis an talamh. Bheadh radharc breathnadóir ar an talamh mar eilimint sreabhán cineálach gan bogadh, agus faoi réir an bhrú statach áitiúil (rud atá, sa chás seo, brú an atmaisféir).<br/>Measaimid anois ar aerárthach a eitilt díreach agus leibhéal le luas (tá aerluais agus luas talún mar an gcéanna, sa sampla seo), ag druidim leis an eilimint sreabhach céanna ó achar mór. Is é an t-achar den sórt sin nach bhfuil an eilimint sreabhach perbured ag an aerárthach druidim. Chun breathnóir ar bord an aerárthaigh, an eilimint sreabhach, cosúil leis na heilimintí sreabhach go léir ag an achar céanna, is cosúil go bhfuil siad i gcoinníollacha saor in aisce, i gcás ina sruthaíonn na heilimintí sreabhach go léir díreach i dtreo an aerárthaigh leis an treoluas leanúnach céanna agus níl aon ghrád brú taobh istigh sa sreabhach (is é sin an brú in áit ar bith sa réigiún sin den sreabhán).[4] Ós rud é gurb é an ghné sreabhach an brú a bhfuil an ghné chéanna ag an dá bhreathnadóir, mar sin is é an brú a chaitheann an breathnadóir ar bhrú statach ar an taobh eile ná breathnóir a bhíonn ag bogadh go réasúnta leis an sreabhán. Is é seo an t-aon chás i dinimic sreabhach nuair, ag labhairt go docht, is féidir an brú statach sainráite a úsáid go cuí[caint ag teastáil], i.e. chun tagairt a dhéanamh don bhrú saor-srutha.<br/>Tabhair faoi deara nuair a thagann an eilimint sreabhach i gcóngar an aerárthaigh, go gcaillfear coinníollacha saor ó shruth, go n-athraíonn a treoluas agus grád brú a fhorbairt. Ní bheidh an brú a chuirtear i bhfeidhm ar an eilimint, dá bhrí sin, cothrom leis an mbrú statach níos mó.<br/><br/>brú statach agus cothromóid Bernoulli<br/><br/>Is féidir an chothromóid Bernaolli, ag glacadh leis go bhfuil sé neamh-inghlactha, sreabhadh dofheicthe agus éifeachtaí gálaidhithe, a scríobh mar seo a leanas:<br/><br/>Ós rud é go bhfuil an téarma ρv2 / 2, de réir sainmhínithe, an brú dinimiciúil mar a thugtar air, an téarma p, de ghnáth brú statach ainmnithe cé go bhféadfadh sé, nó nach bhféadfadh, tagairt a dhéanamh don bhrú atá luaite thuas saor in aisce.Is iad an dá chás is féidir:<br/><br/>Chomhionannas Bernoulli dá dtagraítear i ndálaí saorsrutha - Nuair a chuirtear an chothromóid Bernolli i bhfeidhm ar phointe an tsrutha i bhfad ó shreabhadh ar aon rud, glacann an dá bhrú agus an treoluas a luachanna srutha faoi seach agus, dá bhrí sin, is féidir an chothromóid Bernolli a léamh i gceart mar "comhmhéid an bhrú statach agus (saor in aisce-sruth) go bhfuil brú dinimiciúil ar fud an réimse sreafa".<br/><br/>Chomhionannas Bernouli dá dtagraítear pointe cineálach – Nuair a bhíonn an cothromóid Bernolli scríofa le haghaidh pointe cineálach A den réimse sreafa, mar shampla pointe gar d’aerfil, is é luach an pha brú sreabhach go ginearálta difriúil ón gceann saor-sruthach, agus, ag labhairt go docht, níor cheart an téarma a tharchur mar bhrú statach. D'fhéadfaí an chothromóid Bernoulli a léamh i gceart, mar shampla, "tá suim an bhrú sreabhán in A agus brú dinimiciúil i A tairiseach ar fud an réimse sreabhadh". Mar sin féin tá sé an-choitianta tagairt a dhéanamh don téarma neamh-chreithneach den chothromóid Bernolli mar bhrú statach ar aon nós, is cuma an gcuirtear i bhfeidhm é ar choinníollacha saor-srutha nó nach bhfuil.<br/><br/>Is féidir an dá chás a achoimriú trí chothromóid Bernolli a chur i bhfeidhm ar phointí éagsúla an réimse sreafa: pointe i bhfad uachtair, pointe cineálach gar do chorp agus, i gcomhair iomláine, pointe stáisiún ar dhromchla an chomhlachta:<br/><br/>sa chás:<br/><br/>= brú saor in aisce (statach)<br/><br/>ρ = dlús sreabhach (cinn tairiseach)<br/><br/>= treoluas saor in aisce<br/><br/>p = brú sreabhach i bpointe cineálach<br/><br/>v = treoluas i bpointe cineálach<br/><br/>ps = seasamh (nó brú iomlán)<br/><br/>Féach freisin<br/><br/>Tagairtí<br/><br/>↑ Níl ach cúpla réimse (m.sh. roinnt codanna den fhliú nó ar feadh an taobh amuigh d’fheadáin Phíotála) ina bhfuil an brú a cuireadh i bhfeidhm cothrom leis an mbrú statach; is iad sin na háiteanna ina bhfuil calafoirt statacha suite.<br/><br/>↑ Bheadh luasghéarú mar thoradh ar ghrád brú, agus mar sin ní bheadh an treoluas i gcónaí níos mó. Tabhair faoi deara freisin go bhfuilimid ag faillí an t-athrú ar bhrú an atmaisféir le haird. |
