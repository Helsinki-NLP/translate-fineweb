Plan this with your husband but do NOT start that conversation with "we need to talk!" Starting any conversation like that can immediately put fear into your husband's eyes and defensiveness in his heart. Open the conversation by telling him you're preparing his favorite dessert for a coffee date where you'd like to have a nice conversation. He'll go for it and then you can make it a weekly affair!<br/><br/>I suggest that each of you come to the date with 4 or 5 questions to ask each other. For your very first date, make sure you don't bombard your husband with questions or he won't show up for the next one! :-) Make the questions short and sweet. Show your husband the questions you'll be asking him so he'll know what kind of questions to ask you.<br/><br/>Here are some questions to start the conversation (remember, only choose a few of them for each date):<br/><br/>1) Do you feel that I respect you? Why or Why not?<br/><br/>2) What ways could I show more respect to you?<br/><br/>3) Are you happy with the way things are going right now? Why or Why not?<br/><br/>4) Is there a goal I can help you accomplish this year?<br/><br/>5) What are you stressed or anxious about right now?<br/><br/>6)Is there something I can do for you this week that will help you alleviate stress?<br/><br/>7) If you could dream up a romantic vacation for the two of us, where would we go and what would we do?<br/><br/>8)What romantic activities do you enjoy the most? (no judging when you get a straight answer!) :-)<br/><br/>9) Are you where we thought we would be at this stage in our lives? Why/Why not?<br/><br/>10) Are you disappointed about something in life? What is it and why?<br/><br/>11) How is your relationship with Christ? How can I help you grow closer to Him?<br/><br/>12) What are your favorite desserts?<br/><br/>13) What are your favorite date-night activities?<br/><br/>14) What do you love about our kids?<br/><br/>15) What do you love about me?<br/><br/>16) If money wasn't an issue, what would you like to do that you've always dreamed of?<br/><br/>17) Where do you want to retire? What will we do during retirement?<br/><br/>18) How can we help someone in need this year?<br/><br/>19) Would you be willing to go on some kind of mission trip? If so, where would you be willing to go?<br/><br/>20) What would you like to hear that you haven't heard me say to you--or about you--lately? | Leathanaigh<br/><br/>Dé Máirt, 15 Bealtaine, 2012<br/><br/>Tosaigh Comhrá Dáta Caife<br/><br/>Ag tosú dáta caife seachtainiúil le d’fhear céile is féidir cumarsáid a fheabhsú i do phósadh!

| Breast Cancer Diet<br/><br/>Fight Now: Eat and live proactively against breast cancer is a program designed to help you make choices that can lower your risk of breast cancer.<br/><br/>It was created by Dr. Aaron Tabor, MD, a graduate of the John Hopkins School of Medicine who has conducted a number of research projects exploring preventative nutrition.<br/><br/>Tabor states that if women do not work proactively to prevent breast cancer then their risk of getting breast cancer, or having a recurrence, is much higher.<br/><br/>In this book he outlines simple and practical food and lifestyle choices that women can implement to lower the risk of being affected by breast cancer.<br/><br/>Breast Cancer Diet Basics<br/><br/>Tabor explains the factors that can increase cancer risk and outlines medical research showing that diet and lifestyle can play a major role in prevention of breast cancer. He also emphasizes the importance of a simple lab test that can identify the presence of a vitamin D3 deficiency; a factor that may increase the risk of breast cancer by up to 70%.<br/><br/>Specific foods and supplements are highlighted that can help fight and prevent breast cancer as well as other diseases. Many of these foods are high in antioxidants that help to protect DNA from free radical damage.<br/><br/>General recommendations are to eat a diet that is high in fiber with a low glycemic index. Foods rich in omega 3 fats are also an important aspect of this plan.<br/><br/>A basic low calorie meal plan structure is provided for dieters who need to lose weight, however the Breast Cancer Diet does not include a meal plan for dieters who wish to maintain or gain weight.<br/><br/>Essentially this book is a manual to help keep your body healthy with a whole-foods diet and nutritional supplementation.<br/><br/>Breast cancer survivors can reduce the likelihood of recurrence through a number of lifestyle factors:<br/><br/>Increasing the consumption of cancer-fighting foods<br/><br/>Ensuring an adequate intake of essential nutrients<br/><br/>Keeping the immune system healthy<br/><br/>Nourishing the digestive system<br/><br/>Balancing blood glucose levels<br/><br/>Maintaining an ideal body weight<br/><br/>Using only non-toxic cosmetics and body care products<br/><br/>The Eating for Health Plan<br/><br/>The diet for preventing recurrence of breast cancer emphasizes antioxidant-rich, anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating foods. It is recommended to consume six to twelve servings a day of fresh, whole fruits and vegetables. These plant foods can contain up to 100 phytonutrients, which have been associated with cancer-protection and health recovery.<br/><br/>In conjunction with fruit and vegetables the diet includes healthy fats, complex carbohydrates and lean proteins in appropriate portions. As well as preventing cancer, a nutritious diet promotes increased energy, balanced emotions and makes it easier to manage your weight.<br/><br/>Specific Foods for Breast Cancer-Protection<br/><br/>If cancer is discovered in your body, these same dietary choices can slow the progression of the disease and increase survival time. Also highly beneficial is access to pure air and water, regular physical activity, stress management, adequate sleep and social support. In addition a healthy lifestyle can also improve tolerance of treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation.<br/><br/>Nutritional Supplements for Breast-Cancer Prevention<br/><br/>A nutrient-dense whole foods diet is critical for keeping cancer at bay. However, sometimes it is difficult to get all of the nutrients you need from food.<br/><br/>Certain nutritional supplements are recommended for women due to scientific research suggesting their value for reducing the risk of cancer.<br/><br/>This book provides advice on beneficial supplements and information on specific nutrients that can actually be harmful in high amounts. It also discusses nutrient deficiencies that can occur as a result of the use of prescription medicines.<br/><br/>Exercise Recommendations<br/><br/>Physical activity is important because it helps prevent weight gain and obesity as well as stimulates your immune system to fight cancer. Walking is recommended on the breast cancer diet for thirty to forty five minutes a day, six days a week.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>Dietary recommendations are not always supported with practical advice.<br/><br/>Encourages the intake of processed foods such as protein bars and high protein chips that are not the most health-supportive choices.<br/><br/>The meal plan provided is too low in fruit and vegetables to provide the cancer-preventative effect that has been indicated in scientific research.<br/><br/>Proper Nutrition Can Make a Difference<br/><br/>Readers of Fight Now are provided with lists of recommended dietary changes, however what is lacking is the practical information necessary in order to achieve these goals. For example, dieters are told to consume thirty or more grams a day of soluble fiber without being given information about exactly how to achieve this.<br/><br/>In addition to the lack of specific guidelines the dietary recommendations given for weight loss are not in accordance with the high intakes of fruit and vegetables that have been indicated to be necessary to reduce the risk of breast cancer.<br/><br/>The advice given will certainly result in improvements to health and a reduction in the risk of breast cancer for dieters who are currently eating a standard Western diet. However those with a high risk of breast cancer will probably require a more structured approach in order to achieve the highest degree of protection.<br/><br/>Having just survived triple neg breast cancer, lymph node positive, 3x3cm tumour I can honestly say a holistic approach is best. I have been through chemo, radio, 3 sugeries with one more to come and have sustained naturopath recommended herbs/vitamins through out. Incredibly my recovery has surprised myself and my med. team as I am currently cancer free. I am looking at diet and best practice eg: what to eat to avoid reoccurrnce, because personal journey has convinced me treatment, coupled with naturopathy and faith = survival. Hoping this helps someone. All the best.<br/><br/>I don't think changing anyone's diet is going to get rid of Cancer! :/ Once someone has Cancer, they have Cancer. You can't actually cure Cancer but only kill the Cancerous cells, not to be a downer but a lot of Cancer's can come back. Some breast Cancer's can be a genetic problem as well. End of the day people need a balance diet or they'll miss out on certain minerals or vitamins they need. And I seriously don't believe giving someone an Alkaline is going to kill the cancer! :/ I think his hypothesis is a load of …………<br/><br/>Your comments are unfounded. There is a tun of documented science that proves otherwise. The doctors that make millions along with the drug companies have you bambooseld and scared. Goto beatcancer and get your mind opened and you will survive to perhaps help others.<br/><br/>Hi Debbie, you are mistaken. Your immune system has cells that can identify and kill cancer cells BUT your immune system has to be healthy. Many cancer treatment centers are now heavily focusing on diet as part of treatment.<br/><br/>To everyone with breast cancer… please check Jane Plant diet on the net. She cured har cancer by avoiding completeley any milk and milk products and going vegan for a few months, than returning to eating meat (organic chicken, fish, NO beef or pork). Most important AVOID MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS! Her book "Your life in your hands" explains everything.<br/><br/>To Cristina, Do not give up yet,I am starting on the paleo diet because of my multiple sclerosis.Eating a lot of dark green leaf vegetables are vital in your diet. Did you know also that an italian oncologist discovered that injecting sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) into the cancer cells cures it? I am not in your shoes, but do not give up hope yet. Search cancer and baking soda .<br/><br/>I only need help. I have a relation who has breat cancer already. What diet plan can be followed for healing process? Going through your breast cancer diet, I discovered it is preventive rather than curative.<br/><br/>vegan diet, no sugar, juicing,, add spirilina to your juice, pau de arco tea 3 times a day, don't eat fruits and vegetables at the same meal except to add an apple to your vegetable juice to sweeten it., as much as possible raw. no alcohol or caffene,no soda You need to do everything you can to make your body more alkaline. use distilled water or alkaline water.

| Fancy spending a night washed up on the South Bank? There's another chance to land yourself tickets for an evening aboard the Room for London (aka the landlocked boat perched on the top of the Queen Elizabeth Hall). It doesn't come cheap though (tickets are £300) but it's worth it for the sparkly river views and general kudos of being able to say you spent a night on this exclusive little ship | Tá deis eile ann tú féin a thógáil ar feadh tráthnóna ar bord an tseomra do Londain (aka an bád faoi ghlas atá suite ar bharr Halla na Banríona Eilís).
