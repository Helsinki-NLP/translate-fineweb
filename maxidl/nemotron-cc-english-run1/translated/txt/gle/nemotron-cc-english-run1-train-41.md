| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Samhain 2015<br/>Postáilte ag Dixerol<br/><br/>Is planda ilbhliantúil é Bacopa a théann chun cinn i réigiúin fo-thrópaiceacha agus trópaiceacha mhargacha ar fud na cruinne.Is príomh-chomhábhar é an luibh an-mhór a bhfuil meas air i Doxierol, forlíonadh cothaithe a fheabhsaíonn feidhm chognaíoch.

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there! I absolutely adore the idea of these two spending quality bff time together doing the small but fun things Elsa never experienced as a child.

Ba é guth a máthar é, twisted i brón a hiníon caillte.Tar éis an tsaoil, chuir Kagome cosc ar gan rian. Chuimhnigh sí go bríomhar ar na chuimhneacháin sin, an bealach a thosaigh an lá, cad a bhí sí le haghaidh bricfeasta agus an rud deireanach a dúirt sí lena máthair. Bhí sé ag crochadh, na cuimhní sin, toisc go raibh sé cosúil le haon am eile shleamhnaigh sí idir domhan. Dhúisigh sí, gan liosta, toisc nach raibh aon chuspóir aici lasmuigh den scoil. Bhí post aici, agus bhí sé sceidealta le haghaidh agallaimh an lae sin. Ní raibh a chroí ann, ach ba í an rud a theastaigh uaithi a dhéanamh.<br/><br/>Ba chuimhnigh sí ar an mothú a bhí ag dread, sucking sé suas agus a thabhairt di féin caint pepe go bhféadfadh sí a dhéanamh. Go bhféadfadh sí dul chun cinn sa saol a bhí i gceist aici anois go raibh rudaí socraithe san am atá caite. Ar ndóigh, bhí an mothú lingering sí nach mbaineann sí a thuilleadh ina cuid ama féin nó a saol féin., Ní le gach rud go raibh sí fágtha taobh thiar.<br/><br/>Ba chuimhnigh Kagome ar an mothú ar an adhmad faoina mhéara, ar an mbealach a thug a lámh leigheas ar an láimhseáil chun an doras a shleamhnú oscailte. Chuimhnigh sí gur chuir sí ar sos, ag casadh a máthair le gáire geal agus bríomhar mar a chroith sí í féin óna spórt. "Tá mé ag glacadh amach" Cuimhnigh sí cé chomh láidir agus a guth sounded, an aoibh gháire ar a máthair liopaí mar a súile aonair le bród. A máthair blade a slán, ní raibh cosúil aon difríocht ná roimh ach ar bhealach an meáchan na focail atá socraithe i níos troime ar shoulders Kagome an chuid is mó a léiriú sí.<br/><br/>Go hachomair, chuaigh na smaointe ar aghaidh, ag fiafraí an raibh a máthair buartha léi, chaill sí a leithéid a dhéanamh. D’fhéadfadh Kagome a admháil go hoscailte go bhfuil neart a máthair, a tacaíocht don fhíric gur shleamhnaigh a hiníon tríd an am sin go minic. Bhí amanna ann nuair a cheap sí í féin lag gan an bhean a bheith aici le lean uirthi.<br/><br/>Mar sin féin, chuimhnigh sí go raibh sí ag muster suas le méid meager de neart.D'fhéadfadh sí cuimhneamh ar an athrú ar an aer, an teocht go háirithe difriúil ná an méid a bhí súil aici, blinking ag an timpeallacht tobann agus neamhchoitianta. Agus nuair a chuaigh sí ar ais tríd an doras, bhuail sí le miotail neamhchoitianta agus fhuar faoina mhéar agus bhí taobh istigh nach raibh bealach isteach ar a teach. Sheas fear os a chomhair, taobh thiar de cuntar, a thosaigh uirthi le súile chomh leathan lena cuid féin.<br/><br/>Ní raibh sí scaoll, ar a laghad.Chuaigh sí i mbun ama agus chuir sí i gcásanna dodhéanta ar a laghad thóg sí d’uacht chomh fada agus a tharla sé aisteach. Toisc nach raibh sé gach lá go bhfuair duine éigin iad féin a dragged isteach san am atá caite le Demon, rún a fháil jewel cumhachtach as a n-chomhlacht nach raibh a fhios acu fiú a bhí ann. Agus ansin bhí ar an bhfíric go raibh sí shattered jewel cumhachtach a fhios cé mhéad píosaí agus bhí sé de chúram ar a aimsiú dóibh., Ní raibh rudaí den sórt sin gnáth, agus bhí sí ag teastáil chun cearnach suas agus rolladh leis nuair a thuig sí go raibh a réaltacht. Bhí sé an chuma chomh simplí, ach a bhailiú na shards agus a shocrú an jewel.<br/><br/>Ach ní raibh sé éasca, bhí go leor deamhain i ndiaidh na shards agus an jewel féin., Agus ceann amháin Demon cumhachtach go háirithe le mian go raibh sé cinnte a fheiceáil comhlíonta. Go dtí an lá atá inniu ann, níor fhoghlaim sí a mhian riamh ach bhí a fhios aici nach dtabharfaí é fiú nuair a chríochnaigh sé an rud claonta. Bhí an oiread sin saol scriosta aige ar mhaithe le rud ar bith. Ba é Naraku an foe is deacra, agus an té a bhí i lár gach rud a bhí imithe mícheart i ngach ceann de shaol a cara.<br/><br/>Ach, is é sin unpredictability, go bhfuil gá a rolladh leis an méid a bhí ag tarlú agus an t-uachtpower go raibh sí a fuarthas as a cuid eachtraíochta gur chuimhnigh sí ag tarraingt ar teacht suas le scéal a d'oirfeadh i láthair na huaire nach raibh cuma ró-míniúla nó i bhfad a fháil. Bhí sí ag teastáil chun a chreidiúint, bhí sí ag teastáil chun maireachtáil.<br/><br/>Tar éis an tsaoil, bhí sí níos measa ná fear i siopa ceamara. Bhí sí i gceannas trí na fiacla chun a saol a shábháil roimhe seo.<br/><br/>I ndeireadh na dála, bhí mé ag lorg poist, ní bréag iomlán a bhí ann. Tar éis an tsaoil, bhí sí leagtha amach as a teach agus é ar intinn aici freastal ar agallamh poist. Mhol a hathair ar a laghad a raibh sé ar cheann de na féitheacha níos éasca a dúirt sí riamh.<br/><br/>Agus, ar chúis éigin, gur fhostaigh fear dÚsachtach í.<br/><br/>Пaлb)<br/><br/>Ar a leaba sin, bhrú sí ar ais ar na cuimhní cinn i bhfad i gcéin, ag diúltú a admháil go raibh sí i ndáiríre awakened.Chlait sí ag an spléachadh deireanach ar chodladh, impigh sé ar ais agus a ghlacadh ar ais isteach ina glacadh. Dhún sí a súile, toilteanach codladh le teacht agus níor bhuail sí ach le cuimhní cinn. Na macallaí d’amhrán a bhí le déanamh i gcéin a cuid cuimhní cinn, amhrán a bhí go minic cráite uirthi, mar gheall ar an ainm céanna léi. Ní raibh an guth sin ag canadh i gcuimhne a máthar a thuilleadh, ach is minic a sheinn sí le fás aníos. Thug siad na cuimhní ar ais, cé gur bhlianta a bhí ann ó thosaigh sí ar an saol seo, cé go raibh sí sásta sa saol seo, bhí gairm na gcuimhní seo ró-ard.<br/><br/>Go tobann, bhí sí ag titim ar ais isteach iontu agus d’athraigh sí a codladh arís, bhí sí ag féachaint uirthi féin i gceall a teaghlaigh fad a bhí Iuyasha tarraingthe ar ais isteach san bhuel, ag féachaint mar a bhí sí bhraith sí. Bhí cuimhní na huaire sin, na mothúcháin sin an-láidir fós, agus lean mothú an croí agus brón uirthi arís cé go raibh sé chomh fada sin ó mhothaigh sí go raibh sí sracadh amach ó gach rud a bhí ábhartha di.<br/><br/>Ar ndóigh, d’fhreastail a teaghlach ar a chéile, agus bhí sí sásta a bheith ina n-arm arís. Níorbh fhéidir léi cur síos iomlán a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi ar mhothaigh sí sna laethanta sin. Níorbh fhéidir léi a mhíniú fós ar an mbealach ar bhraith sí scoilt ina dhá, le fonn cogaíochta a bheith ina stair agus sa lá atá inniu ann. chuimhnigh sí ar na hiarrachtaí futile chun léim tríd an tobair, mhéara ag bualadh ag an talamh le pléadáil éadóchasach chun ligean di filleadh. An chéad mhí abhaile, níor chodlaíonn sí an oiread sin agus a ghlaoigh sí.<br/><br/>Elysion Bhí garned imoibriú den chineál céanna, cé nach raibh sé chomh fíochmhar toisc nach raibh a fhios aici go díreach nuair a shleamhnaigh sí trí nó an raibh a fhios aici nuair a d'fhéadfadh sí worm a bealach ar ais. Bhí a cuid gníomhaíochtaí caolchúiseach idir a cuid oibre agus í ag iarraidh í féin a réiteach sa saol seo. Ní raibh aon rún aici fanacht, níl aon intinn aici níos faide a bheith ag fanacht ná mar a bhí ag teastáil uaithi. Agus cé nach ndearna sí iarracht chomh fíochmhar agus a bhí sí nuair a rinne sí iarracht filleadh ar an am atá caite, bhí a paisean deich mbliana d'aois toisc nach raibh aon bhaint aici leis an saol seo.Mar gheall go raibh sí fíor-aonar...<br/><br/>Ina chuimhneacháin neamhaí, shíl sí gur tharraing an Jewel a droim ar ais agus fuair sí ifreann nua di cónaí ann. A ifreann nua a chuirfeadh iallach uirthi mian a dhéanamh, ach chuimhnigh sí go soiléir gur mhian léi go ndeachaigh sí go deo. Ní raibh sin stop a brionglóidí, na hamanna nuair a dhúisigh sí suas i sobbáil na hoíche.Agus ba iad na cuimhní cinn sin a chuaigh thart an ceann is deacra chun déileáil leo, an ceann is deacra chun dearmad a dhéanamh. Thosaigh a chroí ag rás i scaoll mar a chas sí ina leaba arís, d’éirigh a h-anáil ina streachailt agus í ag troid i gcoinne ionsaí scaoll a tharlódh ag bagairt ar an intinn seo go déanach san oíche.<br/><br/>fuath sí mothú chomh lag, mar sin eagla.<br/><br/>■�中文<br/><br/>Ar deireadh tharraing Kagome í féin ón leaba, agus í lit seomra le solas pale a bhí go leor chun í a threorú chuig an seomra folctha. Sheas sí os comhair an scátháin, an doirteal ag rith agus í ag léamh. Raven daite gruaige clúdaithe a aghaidh agus bhraith sí chomh dona mar a d'fhéach sí., Bhí a chéad maidin i Elysion cosúil leis seo, ach bhí sí i gcruth níos measa.<br/><br/>Bhí áit le codladh aimsithe aici, agus í ag bainistiú déileáil le húinéir an fhoirgnimh chun ligean di fanacht ar feadh tréimhse beag ama gan íoc. B'fhéidir go raibh sé tionchar Miroku a lig di dul ar stailc den sórt sin déileálann, mar a bhí ar eolas ag an manach as a bhealach a fheictear (nó scamadh) daoine a thabhairt dóibh níos mó ná go leor le haghaidh an obair a bhí déanta acu. Bhí an manach ar an mbealach sin i gcónaí, ós rud é go mbuailfeadh siad le chéile den chéad uair.éileodh sé go n-éileodh sé úinéireacht tiarna a bheith á hastráil nuair nach raibh sé nó, go raibh siad faoi réir ionsaí nuair nach mbeadh siad. dhíol sé a bhards agus charms do phraghsanna arda den sórt sin. D’oibrigh sé go praiticiúil gach uair agus cheap sí cén fáth go raibh daoine chomh sásta muinín a bheith acu as.<br/><br/>B’fhéidir gur aoibh gháire é, nó gur manaigh a bhí ann go raibh muintir an ama a chuaigh thart chomh sásta bruithnithe a dhéanamh. Níor chreachadh sé riamh ar an lag, ar a laghad. Rinne sé i gcónaí cad a bhí ceart agus bhí sé ina siombail de neart léi ag amanna nuair a bheadh sé a bhrú trí gach rud chun a dhéanamh cad a bhí ceart. bhrú sé tríd an bhfíric go raibh sé ag fáil bháis, go raibh sé mallaithe, agus rinne sé rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi seachas slogtha ina chinniúint. Agus bhí áthas uirthi go raibh siad defeated Naraku sula bhféadfadh sé a bheith faoi réir an chinniúint céanna a athair, agus a athair os a chomhair.<br/><br/>A mhéid a chuaigh a charms féin, áfach, bhí sí níos cothroime ná a cara agus chuir sí an déileáil réasúnta. Ach bhí sí cliste go leor, agus cliste go leor, chun déileáil go maith.<br/><br/>Ach anois, bhí Kagome in áit níos fearr cé go raibh an cuma ar a aghaidh mar an gcéanna. Haunted, tuirseach, draenáilte...<br/><br/>Sracfhéachaint tapa ar chlog ar an mballa inis di go bhféadfadh sí iarracht a chodladh níos faide.Ach roghnaigh sí as sin, nach bhfuil ag iarraidh aghaidh a thabhairt ar an lasracha arís. Thóg sí cith ina ionad, ag baint úsáide as an uisce fuar a chase ar shiúl a demons, a líonadh a scamhóga le iontógáil géar anáil agus fórsa féin a awake.<br/><br/>ПaПoлbлaы<br/><br/>Ní raibh sé ag obair.<br/><br/>Is cinnte gur chuir an t-uisce fuar an t-aer i bhfeidhm ina scamhóga, b’éigean di a intinn a mhúscailt agus a matáin a urghabháil.Tarraing gáire searbh óna liopaí mar a luaigh sí a ceann ar ais agus fuair sí í féin ag cuimhneamh níos mó. Sa lá atá inniu, ní raibh sí ag dul chun éalú mar sin go héasca., Ní raibh sí ag dul a ghnóthú mar sin go simplí, a ghnóthú ach toisc go mbeidh sí é.<br/><br/>Uaireanta, níl aon smaointe a theastaigh uait a sheachaint. Fiú nuair a bhí tú cinnte go raibh tú san am atá thart orthu.<br/><br/>Ba mhór an cúnamh a bhí ag Sango sa chás seo, ba í an tslayer Demon an cara is fearr di, bheadh sí ag dul chomh fada lena deirfiúr nach raibh sí riamh ciallmhar, bhí a taobh i gcónaí nuair a tháinig deacracht chun cinn aici. Go háirithe trioblóid buachaill, nuair a bhí rudaí den sórt sin in áit fánach ach bhí sé spraoi a bheith acu crush agus as a cara a dhéanamh ar a son nuair a rinne Inuyasha a brónach. Tar éis an tsaoil, bhí sé go minic go mbeadh an leath-demon a rith go dtí an taobh a leannán marbh agus briseadh a croí níos mó ná uair amháin.<br/><br/>Ach spreag Santiago í ar bhealaí eile freisin.Tar éis na mná go léir a bhí os comhair, bhí sí i gcónaí chomh láidir, chomh cinnte... Fiú sna hamanna a raibh amhras uirthi féin, tharraing sí tríd i gcónaí. Mheas sí go raibh sí an cumas chun maireachtáil tar éis a chailleadh a teaghlach ar fad - an meabhrúchán de seo go minic a bhrúigh Kagome chun maireachtáil, toisc gur chaill sí gach duine leis an saol - agus ansin tar éis a dheartháir a bheith ina ngeall ar Narku. Ní raibh sé éasca, ní fhéadfadh a bheith rud éigin leis sin ach d'fhéadfadh duine ar bith aghaidh agus fós dul ar aghaidh leis. Fheiceáil sí go fóill, fiú leis an pian agus na meabhrúcháin sin... Go minic bhí sí chomh geal, fiú sna hamanna níos dorcha.<br/><br/>Agus anois, theastaigh uaithi a leanacht ar thaobh na mná níos sine, chun sólás a ghlacadh ar an bhfíric go raibh sí ann agus go raibh sí tacúil. Mhothaigh sí go ndéanfadh Santiago tarraingt air seo ar bhealach éigin, agus go dtugann sí roinnt focail neart agus tuisceana. Bhí sé uaireanta mar seo a rinne na geasa níos measa, an i gcuimhne leanúnach go raibh sí gan a teaghlach.<br/><br/>"Níl mé ag iarraidh a bheith ina n-aonar."Chreid sí os ard ina aonair, an fhuaim an cith drown amach an plea.<br/><br/>Ní raibh eagla uirthi í a ligean isteach.<br/><br/>Úrscéal Ø�ПoЩに<br/><br/>Uair an chloig eile a shleamhnaigh í sular thuig sí é. Bhí a craiceann fuar ón uisce agus mhothaigh sé go raibh oighear ag rith trína veins.Níor thuig sí go raibh sí tosaithe ar a lámh go dtí go ndeachaigh sí as an uisce agus go deireadh lena cith. Ní raibh Kagome lorg a gaze féin sa scáthán arís, ina ionad sin, fillte sí í féin i tuáillí agus truded amach as an seomra folctha, suas an staighre agus isteach ina cistin. Thosaigh sí ar bhricfeasta éadrom a dhéanamh, ag léamh go hidéalach trína nótaí don lá mar bhia a bhí bruite.<br/><br/>Bhí a gairmréim ag tógáil amach na mblianta seo caite. Bhí a cuid grianghraf le feiceáil i go leor dánlanna, thosaigh a hainm ar go minic go leor liopaí dóibh siúd a raibh suim acu i ngrianghrafadóireacht.<br/><br/>Bhí sí i bhfad níos mó ádh ná mar a bhí súil aici ar an saol seo.Ní raibh an t-ádh léi ar ais trí na scoilteanna isteach ina saol féin, ach an t-ádh go leor chun é a dhéanamh go maith. Agus í ag iompú ar ais go dtí an sorn, chuimhnigh sí ar an am a thug sí ar deireadh suas ar filleadh abhaile. Bhí sé thart ar dhá bhliain ina saol anseo, mar a thosaigh sí ag fiontar grianghrafadóireacht mar go raibh sí níos mó ná caitheamh aimsire ach d’fhéadfadh sí ainm a dhéanamh di féin.<br/><br/>Bhí an lá sin an-taitneamhach, bhí an ghrian ard sa spéir agus fuair sí roinnt grianghraf den tírdhreach nádúrtha í féin. Bhí buachaill beag i bhfolach i gceann de na plandaí, agus bhí sí gafa pictiúr de na nóiméad a bhí socraithe a aghaidh isteach i ngrá cheerful, mischievous an nóiméad sula raibh sé léim amach chun tús a chreiche. Chuir sé i gcuimhne dó go raibh sí, go bunúsach, ag glacadh leis, an trealamh beag ama. Bhí sé stróicthe óna theaghlach freisin nuair a bhuail siad leis an chéad uair. Maraíodh a athair agus bhí sé meáite air é a dhíoghaileadh. Cé go raibh sé óg, is cosúil go raibh sé chomh aibí ina chéad teagmháil.<br/><br/>B'fhéidir go raibh sé an tionchar a bhí ag Inuyasha a lig an trealamh a bheith ag gníomhú cosúil le kid arís, a bheith óg agus whimical ag amanna cé go raibh sé níos aibí. Chuir sé a chompord ar fáil di ina bhealach féin, agus rinne sí iarracht aire a thabhairt dó mar bheadh sí féin cé go raibh sí chomh óg sin chomh maith., Mar sin féin, ní raibh a óige stop a chur léi ó thuiscint conas aire a thabhairt dó nó aire a thabhairt dó cosúil lena leanbh. Chloígh a croí nuair a bhí sé chomh sásta sin as a bhronntanas criáin agus ghlac sé an t-am chun ealaín a dhéanamh. Bhí sí chomh bródúil as gach líníocht a chríochnaigh go raibh a fhios aici go raibh a máthair ag mothú i staid den sórt sin.<br/><br/>Bhí an pian a bhí sracadh aici i bhfad ró-mhaith, ró tobann. Chaill sí é agus theastaigh uaithi a fheiceáil cé mhéad a d'fhás sé ó bhí sí imithe. Chaill sí an oiread sin...<br/><br/>Chun í féin a spáráil ar aon phian breise, súil bréagach... Thug sí suas í féin agus dhírigh sí uirthi féin a fheabhsú.<br/><br/>жoдa亀�<br/><br/>Blaiseadh an bhanda, leadránach agus spreag sí í. Ach amháin tar éis di a bheith críochnaithe thuig sí go raibh sí dearmad déanta aici ar spíosraí nó blas ar bith ar an mbia. Bhí sé rómhall anois a mheabhrú go raibh an oiread sin, mar a bhí a intinn ró-ghnóthach ag cuimhneamh ar shonraí eile a saoil a bhí níos tábhachtaí ná a cuid bia go soiléir.<br/><br/>"Suigh"!<br/><br/>Ar ndóigh, ní tharla aon rud nuair a bhí sí an-dílsithe ag cliant amháin frustrach go háirithe a chuir i gcuimhne di go raibh sé thar a bheith caol agus drochbhéasach, agus é ag iarraidh grianghraf a thógáil seachas ligean dó oibriú amach go nádúrtha. D’fhéadfá iarracht a chur i bhfeidhm ainmhithe fiáine a iompar conas a theastaigh uait. Ach, is annamh a d’éirigh le duine ar bith le fórsa. Ní raibh Inuyasha chomh dona, áfach. D’fhoghlaim Inuyasha sular cuireadh iachall uirthi. Bhí sé níos ciúine, níos tuisceana, níos aibí cé go raibh sé fós childish agus cocky.<br/><br/>Is cuimhin léi cé chomh dearg a bhí a leicne dóite, ach conas a sheas sí a talamh agus fired air. Dúirt sí leis dhiúltaigh sí a bheith ag obair do dhuine ar bith nó le duine ar bith a bhí ag iarraidh rud éigin a casadh thar a bhfuil sé de chineál, thar a bhfuil sé féin ar mian leis.<br/><br/>Cé nach raibh a leithéid d’intinn ag a cliant i gcomparáid leis an bhfear chun Naraku seachas Inuyasha. Ar a laghad, ba chuimhne taitneamhach a bhí sa mothú ina dhiaidh sin. An tsaoirse a fhios agam gur tháinig sí chomh fada sin go bhféadfadh sí diúltú don obair nach raibh sí ag iarraidh a dhéanamh, a bheith mar dhuine féin a bhí neamhspleách ar dhaoine eile. D'fhéadfadh sí a rá go ndearna sí í ag an bpointe sin. Cé gur chuala sí ráflaí lá ina dhiaidh sin le focail a bhí i gceist léi a clúmhilleadh.<br/><br/>Rinne sí í féin a chosaint go ceart, mar a rinne sí i dtreo dheireadh a turais. Tar éis an tsaoil, ba í an t-aon duine a d’fhéadfadh í féin a chosaint ar an saol seo.<br/><br/>滑�<br/><br/>Ar maidin thosaigh solas ag creep isteach ina teach, ag cur i gcuimhne di arís ar an sliocht ama. Arís, mheas sí go raibh ar liosta na rudaí a bhí le déanamh aici agus díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar an áit le tosú. Nó, más ceart di fiú tosú ar chor ar bith. Le conas a thosaigh an lá, ní raibh a fhios aici an bhféadfadh sí a mheas gur smaoineamh iontach é. Bhí sé amhrasach go mbeadh sí rathúil leis an gcaoi a raibh sí caillte ann féin.<br/><br/>Ní raibh sí ag iarraidh a praiseach suas a cuid oibre is déanaí., Toisc go ndearna sí é sin ar chúpla ócáid roimhe. Ní raibh sé taitneamhach chun iarracht a dhéanamh agus a aisghabháil ó tubaiste iomlán.<br/><br/>Chuimhnigh Kagome ar an mothú ar a daor, branda nua, ceamara slipping óna lámha., Ní raibh sí sásta chun tacú leis, toisc go raibh sí bainte díreach as a mála. Chuid a screamed ar an taobh istigh. A drámatúil, ró-an-barr, iomlán ar scream go raibh sí go minic nuair a bhí sí i bhfad níos óige, i bhfad níos óige., Nuair a bhí sí ag streachailt a dhéanamh trí mheán na scoile agus ag hopping idir amanna. D'fhan an chuid eile dá cuid reoite agus í ag bualadh go hiomlán le chéile agus bhí an chuid eile den cheamara briste leis.<br/><br/>Ba í deartháir Inuyasha, Demon iomlán, a bhí ina seasamh uirthi an rud deireanach a raibh sí ag súil léi nuair a rinne sí a bealach amach dá cuid grianghraf. Ní raibh sé ag breathnú ar chor ar bith a bheith i saol go hiomlán difriúil, cé nach raibh sí an chuid is fearr ag léamh a intinn., Bhí a ainm ar a liopaí chomh cumhachtach, go bhféadfadh sí cuimhneamh ar na mothúcháin is tanaí mar a rinne sí. Caitheadh a liopaí, bhraith a béal tirim, agus rinne an mothú bubbling imní ina bholg a bhraitheann sí tinn.<br/><br/>Ní raibh sí ag iarraidh a bheith suas.<br/><br/>Ach, bhí sí ag iarraidh air a bheith ann, fiú amháin más rud é nach raibh siad cairde., Bhí siad allies, más rud é, ós rud é go raibh siad ag throid taobh le taobh., Agus bhí rud éigin níos fearr ná rud ar bith.<br/><br/>Agus bhí Kagome an ciall go leor gan caith í féin air, a wrap a lámha timpeall air i bhfaoiseamh nach raibh a fhios aici nach raibh sí ina n-aonar. Chuimhnigh sí nach raibh aon rud eile ábhartha ar feadh laethanta mar a chaith sí am leis, gan labhairt ar a saol ach labhairt (nó, bhí sí ag labhairt agus admhaigh sé go simplí).<br/><br/>Nuair, go díreach, thit sí ar a son cé... Ní raibh Kagome cuimhneamh. Bhí sé ina rud caolchúiseach, díreach mar a bhí sé. Ach bhí a fhios aici go raibh an mothú ann. Agus lig sé di a fhios nach raibh sí ina n-aonar ar an bhfíric go raibh sí ag titim, go raibh mothúcháin ar bhealach blossomed.<br/><br/>cliceáil anseo chun tuilleadh eolais a fháil.<br/><br/>Thug mothú neamhthrócaireach di agus go tobann d’oscail a súile agus í ag éileamh go raibh sí ag déanamh an rud deireanach. Níor thug sí chun cuimhne nuair a bhí sí ag titim ina codladh ar a tolg, ach bhí a fhios aici go raibh sí ar an áit dheireanach a bhí sí i bhfad ró-chompordach.Ní raibh sí ag streachailt, áfach, ná ag troid leis an laige mar a bhí sí i airm aithnidiúla. Luadh a ceann i gcoinne cófra Shessoumaru, ag cur chompord ar an bhfíric go raibh sé anseo agus ní raibh sí ina n-aonar.<br/><br/>Ba dhuine bog le haitheantas a thabhairt dó féin “Fáilte ar ais” agus níor ghá dó mórán a labhairt léi chun a intinn a thuiscint, nó an chuid eile den mhéid a bhí le rá aige.<br/><br/>Rinne sé í ar ais chuig a leaba, shocraigh sí í isteach gan stró. Chuaigh a shúile i ngleic lena shúile agus chuir sí aoibh gháire go héasca toisc nach raibh aon cuimhní cinn níos sruthaithe aici, ní raibh níos mó cuimhní cinn á dta ag teastáil, aon uair nach raibh sé in aice leis, níor thit sí ar ais isteach sna smaointe sin riamh. Bhí sé ina chuidiú, agus chabhraigh na blianta leis. Bhí an lá atá inniu ann... Ceann de na laethanta sin.<br/><br/>D’ordaigh sé gan stró, a súile a rolladh air ach ní raibh sí ag troid toisc go raibh sí tuirseach. Chlug a láimhe go docht dó, agus bhraith sí a lámh os coinne brúigh ar a forehead mar mheasúnú ar a folláine.<br/><br/>Tá mé ceart go leor," a dúirt sí, a focail daingean lena gealltanas.<br/><br/>Bhí sí ceart go leor. Bhí sí beo. Agus bhí sí sásta.<br/><br/>Пaлb)<br/><br/>loingseoir<br/><br/>achoimre<br/><br/>Ba chailín sách rialta í Kagome, ag pointe amháin ina saol go dtí go ndearna demon taobh istigh de theach maith a teaghlach ionsaí uirthi. Dragged síos di go maith, a d'iompair timpeall 500 bliain isteach san am atá caite. D’fhoghlaim sí go ndearnadh glóthach naofa a mhéadú taobh istigh dá corp mar ba í athchomhdháil ar shagart a fuair bás 50 bliain roimh an am ar tarraingíodh isteach í. Bhí an jewel sracadh as a corp agus bhí an Demon a dragged di tríd an am defeated ag an leath-demon gur freed sí a bhí pinned chun an crann. Kagome bened an leath-demon, Inuyasha, in am agus taistil leis a chur ar ais ar an jewel go bhfuil sí, í féin, shattered., Cé nach raibh sé chomh simplí agus éasca a dhéanamh mar go leor deamhain agus daoine a lorg an jewel chun a gcuspóirí féin. Bhí sí cairdiúil le Demon kostine óga, mank, agus slayer Demon a thaistil go léir léi chun an jewel a chur ar ais.<br/><br/>Mar sin féin, ní raibh a grúpa an ceann a chur i gcrích an jewel.Ina ionad sin, olc leath-demon a ionramháil an chuid is mó de na himeachtaí móra i an chuid is mó de shaol a chompánach. Nuair a bhailigh sé ar deireadh na píosaí ar an jewel agus rinne sé a mhian ar an réad taite, bhí Kagome tharraingt isteach ar an jewel é féin leis an intinn aici féin a dhéanamh ar mian leis a choinneáil gafa di taobh istigh go deo, a choinneáil ar an jewel beo. Ba é seo bunchloch Inuyasha a d’éirigh léi í a shábháil ón dorchadas. Sa deireadh, d’fhill sí ar a cuid ama nádúrtha, chríochnaigh sí scoil ard mar a raibh súil aici ó chailín a cuid amlíne. Tá sí sa saol seo le cúig bliana, agus tá sé tugtha suas le fada ó shin ar filleadh abhaile.<br/><br/>plaisteach<br/><br/>Tá sé in áit éasca do Kagome cairde nua a dhéanamh, níor athraigh sí i bhfad óna óige.Is bean óg gheanúil í atá ionbhách agus fáilteach don chuid is mó dá saol ar fad. Ina óige, chuir sí eagla ar an gcuid is mó díobh. Fiú deamhain a úsáidtear chun daoine a ithe, tá sí neamhdhíobhálach agus d'athraigh sí a bealaí (Ba mhaith léi buíochas a cheapann). Tá sé seo á rá, tá sé i ndáiríre éasca a bheith ar a cara chomh fada agus a bhfuil duine in ann a thaispeáint go bhfuil siad sásta a bheith fhuascailt, nó a thaispeáint nach bhfuil siad go hiomlán olc. Mothaíonn sí go mór do gach duine bhuaileann sí, mar sin tá sé deacair di gan tarraingt le daoine eile ar mian leo a bheith ina gcairde.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>Is é an t-aon bhealach chun wrath kamagrame a thuilleamh ná a bheith chomh diomprable, chomh olc, agus go dtí seo níos faide ná fhuascailt nach féidir léi a fheiceáil ar aon mhaith ann., Agus is féidir léi a fheiceáil ar an maith i go leor gach duine agus gach rud., Go hionraic, lena bhfuil sí ag tabhairt aghaidhe? Leath-demon a chuir dhá leannán i gcoinne a chéile, a bhí ag moladh líne iomlán fireann duine dá cairde, agus ansin bhí a cara is fearr aici ag marú a dteaghlach... Sea, ní fheiceann mé í ag caitheamh duine ar bith gan iad i ndáiríre, ag obair dó i ndáiríre. Thig leat a thabhairt dó lámhaigh, áfach.<br/><br/>rómánsúil<br/><br/>Nuair a bhíonn sé i ngrá, is tacaíocht láidir é Kagome, ag fanacht ann i gcónaí fiú nuair a d'fhéadfadh a bheith garbh, áfach, nach bhfuil Kagome ag lorg grá, nach raibh grá á lorg aici nuair a tháinig sí amhlaidh nach bhfuil aon chaidreamh roimhe seo ann. Ní hé seo le rá nach bhfuil duine éigin tar éis titim i ngrá léi. Is féidir léi a bheith cinnte ar an ábhar ar ghrá gan aithne duine, is dócha go mbeidh sí soiléir faoi, áfach.

Níl a lán a mheá ar a aigne ós rud é go raibh sí chun troid a teaghlach breithe i gcoinne a uacht agus an uair dheireanach a chonaic sí iad go léir go leor fuath léi. Frankly nach bhfuil sí ag obair trí gach rud go fóill ó bhí sí go bunúsach ag ceann cogaidh ar scála iomlán., Is dóigh liom go bhféadfadh siad a bheith cairde mar tá Corrin oscailte go leor ina pearsantacht, thar a bheith iontaofa freisin.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Cén fáth ar chóir duit a bheith ar Twitter<br/><br/>Séanadh: Níl mé, ná ní dhearna mé riamh a bheith, gúrú meán sóisialta. Níl mé ach duine a cheapann go leor, agus tá sé seo tagtha suas le roinnt uaireanta.<br/><br/>Uaireanta ní uchtóir luath mé a thógann sé orm blianta a dhéanamh amach cad ba mhaith liom rud éigin a úsáid sula bhfaighim air i ndáiríre, agus bhí Twitter ar cheann de na rudaí sin.Tá mé ar Twitter dáiríre ó mhí Feabhra na bliana seo, mar sin táim nua go leor. Fós féin, d'fhoghlaim mé roinnt rudaí, agus theastaigh uaim iad a roinnt. Deir roinnt daoine gur pusher Twitter mé, agus tá mé, toisc go bhfuil go leor cúiseanna maithe le fáil air, agus beagnach aon míbhuntáistí.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ar an idirlíon, is dócha gur chuala tú faoi.Is líonra meán sóisialta é a fheidhmíonn mar fhóram comhráite, nuashonruithe, agus nuacht i meán níos mó poiblí ná rud éigin cosúil le Facebook nó LinkedIn. Baineann Facebook leis na daoine atá ag iarraidh tú a aimsiú, ach baineann Twitter leis na daoine is fearr leat a fháil. Is dócha gurb iad na scríbhneoirí, na haisteoirí, na polaiteoirí, na hamhránaithe agus na heolaithe is fearr leat ar Twitter. Mar sin is iad na carthanachtaí, na stáisiúin raidió, na suíomhanna nuachta, na siopaí. Agus ba mhaith leo go bhfaighidh tú iad agus go n-éistidís lena bhfuil le rá acu. Gach duine ar Twitter, ar dtús, ba mhaith leo labhairt leat.<br/><br/>Ach cén fáth a bheith páirteach sin? Cén fáth a bheith ina chuid de? Níl gach cineál na cúiseanna, agus tá mé ag dul a thabhairt duit cúpla.<br/><br/>Is bealach iontach é daoine agus Áiteanna Twitter chun eolas a fháil faoi imeachtaí atá ar siúl ar fud an domhain, ach freisin i do phobal.

| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Na hOileáin Fhilipíneacha Peso<br/><br/>An smaoineamh go bhfaigheann tú canáil fréimhe cuireann an chuid is mó daoine ar imeall.Úsáideann SCM Fiaclóireachta an teicneolaíocht agus an teicníc is déanaí chun canáil fréamhacha a dhéanamh saor ó phian agus nós imeachta strus íseal.<br/><br/>Teicneolaíocht agus teicníc chun cinn is ea endodontics, an téarma cliniciúil le haghaidh chanáil fréamhTagraíonn an téarma "canáil fréimhe" don cavity nádúrtha i lár an fiacail.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Eaglaiseach Bun Adhmad<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Eaglaiseach Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Anois ar a dtugtar Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Idir 1860 agus 1880, d'éirigh an t-ionad as Cathair Londain chun séarach, iarnróid agus bóithre nua a thógáil. Leagadh tithe gan aird ar na tionóntaí a raibh orthu a fháil cibé lóistín a d'fhéadfadh siad a bheith in áit eile. Lean na bainisteoirí ar aghaidh le cónaí i Kensington agus in Adhmad Naomh Eoin, agus scaip na daoine is boichte ar na ródlanna mar Seachtú Dials agus Garránlisn. Dóibh siúd idir, na cléirigh agus na hoibrithe oilte, cuireann tógálaithe amhantrach ar bun tar éis a chéile de Villas ardánithe agus bhog an tUasal Potter isteach Holloway. Bhí muintir Chnoc Mhuire ag faire ar thithe creep trasna ar réimsí Páirc Inis Toirc, suas Cnoc Crouch agus síos an taobh eile, ionas go raibh críochnaithe faoi 1880, agus nach raibh aon bhealach ann chun an sreabhadh a stopadh. Roghnaíodh Upton Farm agus na Coimisinéirí eisciúla ag iarraidh Woodquay Bun an Teampaill a fhorbairt deich mbliana ina dhiaidh sin, ar a dtugtar Coillte na Banríona, áit a mbeadh dráma Ibsen déanta sa scéal. Dhá ghrúpa de dhaoine macánta, an-spreagtha ag troid le haghaidh cad a cheap siad go raibh gach ceart. Na Coimisinéirí Eisciúla ar thaobh amháin agus Coiste na gCarthanais Hornsey ar an taobh eile, chreid siad araon go raibh siad ag déanamh a ndícheall do dhaoine eile, agus d’ardaigh an pobal ina gcoinne ar an dá<br/><br/>Ag an am sin bhí Bóthar Chnoc na Muaisín ina bhóthar tuaithe, le Halla an Chalaidh Theas, agus Feirm Uton ag an gceann eile. Tógadh Gairdíní Osla, Garraithe Chonnachta amach, agus bhí na tógálaithe suite chun eastát Choill na Coillte a fhorbairt. Gearrtha as adhmad Bun an Teampaill ab ea grúpa tithe beaga anuas, ar shuíomh triantánach. Léiríonn léarscáil gan nuashonrú, atá i seilbh na gCoimisinéirí Leictreacha sé Teachín wasteland le hoscailt eatarthu - ní bóthar, ní miotail, ach ar bhealach go dtí na leapacha sútha talún taobh thiar de. Ina theannta sin, bhí bearna eile ann ba chúis le cosáin tríd an adhmad. Bhí an dá oscailt seo mar bhunús leis an bplean. Is féidir an dá bhearna chéanna agus an talamh glanta, a bhí mar pháirc sútha talún, a fheiceáil sa léarscáil 1894 thíos. Tá siad léirithe mar ‘Muswell Hill Cottages’ agus, go leor ar fad, bhí Peter Sellers chun cónaí ar an suíomh céanna i bhfad níos déanaí. Chun an t-adhmad a fhorbairt mar eastát tithíochta, ní mór do na Coimisinéirí dhá bhóthar a thiomáint ó Bhóthar Chnoc Mhuire agus tithe a thógáil leo. Ní bheadh seomra curtha ar fáil do go leor tithe chun an t-iontraíocht a chur ar fáil do Bhóthar Chnoc Mhuire amháin.<br/><br/>Tugadh an talamh agus na tithe i bhfad níos luaithe mar tithe d’aoiseanna agus coinnigh Iontaobhaithe Choimisinéirí Carthanachta Hornsey iad, agus bhí gá le deisiú mhór ag na tithe tábhairne. Go poiblí-spioradach, ar mian leo an chuid is fearr a dhéanamh dá sean-tionóntaí, ní fhéadfadh na hIontaobhaithe iad a fheabhsú ós rud é nach raibh aon airgead acu. Roinnt blianta sular bheartaigh na Coimisinéirí Geilleagraí é a fhorbairt mar eastát tithíochta, ach bhuail sé seo le chéile an freasúra gur thacaigh siad leis an bpobal. Ina ionad sin, in 1886, thug siad gach coillearnach 69 acra don phobal. Ag an am céanna thairg siad adhmad Bun an Cheardlann a dhíol le Comhairle Ceantair Uirbeach Hornsey ar £ 25,000, ach bhí sé seo i bhfad ró-le haghaidh Hornsey a ardú as a chuid féin. Dúirt an Chomhairle gur bhain daoine a bhí ina gcónaí lasmuigh de Hornsey taitneamh as an adhmad agus gur cheart d’údaráis eile cabhrú leis, ach níor tugadh aon chabhair.<br/><br/>Léarscáil a thaispeánann na Iostáin Chnoic Muswell a bhí mar lár an chonspóid.<br/><br/>Bóthar Chnoc na Muswell thart ar 1880<br/><br/>Dealraíonn sé gurb iad na trí phéire teachín seo na cinn i lár na díospóide.<br/><br/>Bhí na Coimisinéirí Leictreachas ag iarraidh airgead a bhailiú le haghaidh a chuid oibre eaglaise sa Bhreatain agus thar lear. Mheas siad gur tugadh an talamh dóibh a bhí le húsáid don iomadra reiligiún agus, más rud é go raibh sé i gceist leis seo talamh nó coillte a dhíol níos lú ná mar a chuir srian ar obair na heaglaise. Thug siad Galve Pit Wood don phobal: ina áit d’fhorbair siad adhmad Bun an Teampaill.<br/><br/>Bhí Iontaobhaithe na gCarthanais Hornsey ag iarraidh ioncam a tháirgeadh chun cabhrú lena ndaoine bochta, agus mar sin rinne siad tairiscint do na Coimisinéirí. Rinneadh a bpíosa talún triantánachta a mhúnlú go mór le forbairt go heacnamaíoch, ach dá dtabharfaí níos mó talún do na Coimisinéirí chun é a dhéanamh i suíomh cearnach, thógfadh siad cúig villa néata is fiche. Dá bharr sin, bheadh cíosanna talún de £ 225 in aghaidh na bliana, a d'fhéadfaí a úsáid chun bochtaineacht na ndaoine Hornsey a mhaolú. Mar chúiteamh air sin, bheadh cead acu an Coimisiún a ghearradh ar dhá bhóthar trína gcuid talún ionas go bhféadfadh na Coimisinéirí na coillte a fhorbairt.<br/><br/>Nuair a bhí an tairiscint seo ar eolas daoine imoibríonn láithreach le haláram.<br/><br/>Ar an 16 Nollaig 1893, d’iarr an tUasal Carvell Williams MP i dTeach na dTeachtaí, más rud é gur thoiligh na Coimisinéirí Speisialta le stiall talún a dhíol le hIontaobhaithe na gCarthanais Hornsey ar choinníoll go ndéanfaí bóthar reatha a leathnú go dtí 40 troigh, bíodh sé sin ina réamhtheach le scéim tógála agus dá mbeadh deis ag Teach na Parlaiminte tuairim a chur in iúl.<br/><br/>D’fhreagair an tUasal Leveson Gower, Coimisinéir Eastát na hEaglaise", "Tá" ar an gcéad chuid.<br/><br/>An tUasal Marvel Williams, "An dtuigeann mé go bhfuil sé ar intinn an chuid sin de Highgate Woods a scriosadh trína thógáil air?"<br/><br/>Dhá lá ina dhiaidh sin d’fhoilsigh an Réalta alt fiúntach ar aon tabloid nua-aimseartha.<br/><br/>An Star<br/>18 Nollaig 1893<br/><br/>‘Ní mór don Pharlaimint faire fonn a choinneáil ar na sean-rudaí agus ar na cónaidhmeanna sin de chuid an fhoirgnimh Jerry-Elic.Tá siad i gcónaí ag cur píosa éigin talún i gcoinne na tógálaithe i gcomparáid leis an bpobal i gcoitinne. Ní dhíolfadh na Coimisinéirí adhmad Bun an Teampaill do na radaitheoirí ach molann siad anois é a oscailt trí dhá bhóthar leathan a ghearradh ina leith i dtaca le ceann amháin dá scéimeanna tógála iomadúla. Ní iarrfaidh duine ar bith ceist sa Pharlaimint agus ní dhéanfaidh sé/sí beartas bríce agus moirtéal na gCoimisinéirí a sheiceáil?'<br/><br/>Faoin am a bhí sé seo a phriontáil, cuireadh an cheist agus bhí an freagra bréagach, nó devious., ghlac páipéir eile ar an scéal. Dúirt na hAmóirí, i dtuarascáil fhada, nach raibh na Coimisinéirí sásta gnóthas a thabhairt don Pharlaimint, nó d’aon chomhlacht poiblí eile, gur cheart deis a bheith acu aon scéim a bhreithniú le tógáil ar shuíomh an adhmaid.<br/><br/>Tháinig an cor i bhfeidhm ar feadh ocht mí déag go dtí gur cuireadh iallach ar na Coimisinéirí eaglasta fiosrúchán a oscailt, a thosaigh ag Highgate an 31 Bealtaine 1895, faoi chathaoirleacht Coimisinéara Cóheilit Cúnta. Chuir an Fiosrúchán flúirse litreacha nuachtáin ar fáil agus ba é seo an ceann ba thábhachtaí.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicles, 5 Meitheamh 1895<br/><br/>VANDALimisM ATHAINGNÍ<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Tá sé faoi bhagairt ar cheann de na cailíní is áille sa choillearnach in suburban Londain.An mbeidh tú ag cabhrú linn a bhronnadh ar an méid a bheadh ina calamity, ní hamháin go dtí an ceantar láithreach, ach go dtí an ceann iomlán de na dlúithe daonra Thuaidh Londain? In aon chuid den cathair tá an tógálaí níos gníomhaí ná mar a bhí i Crouch End agus Hornsey.Is iad na móin álainn bliain nó dhó ó shin ná tithe agus siopaí anois. Tá sé ag tarlú go bhfuil dúile agus cófraí ann go mór, agus a luaithe a bhíonn sráidbhailte taitneamhach ag roinnt cinniúint Stroud Green, Haringay, Páirc Finbury, Highbury agus Islington. ---<br/><br/>--- Is é an cuspóir dhá bhóthar daichead a thógáil trí na coillte.Tá a fhios againn sa cheantar seo an bhrí atá le bóithre daichead a thógáil trí choill. Ciallaíonn sé go bhfuil na coillte doomed. Deich mbliana ó shin, shábháil corraíl ar an deirfiúr-adhmad de seasca acra - The Grove Pit Woods - agus ní raibh duine ar bith ann a chonaic na sluaite saoire bainc ag troid suas Bóthar na hEardbhealaigh ó shráideanna Dhúchasacha na Holloway, na hOileán Uí Uainn agus na Chléirigh, agus d’fhéach siad ar taitneamh na bpáistí agus na bpáirtithe teaghlaigh a bhí ag péinteáil ar an féar agus i measc na gcrann, a d’fhéadfadh teip ar an mborradh atá á léiriú ag na Coimisinéirí eaglasta ar an adhmad seo go léir ó thuaidh, ach bhí an t-adhmad Íochtarach de seasca acra mar chomhlánú nádúrtha i gcónaí ar an taobh eile. ----<br/><br/>--- Tá beagnach aon trian de pharóiste mór Hornsey ag na Coimisinéirí Leictrealacha. Trí chaiteachas liobrálacha airgead na n-íocóirí agus bóithre á n-oscailt agus forbairt ghinearálta an cheantair, tá méadú ollmhór tagtha ar luach a maoine, agus ón incrimint neamhthuillte a tharraingíonn siad ioncaim mhóra gach bliain. Surely d'fhéadfadh na paidreacha a bhfuil airgead agus mar sin chabhraigh a chruthú ar an eastát ollmhór a bheith ag súil le cóireáil liobrálacha ar ais. ---<br/><br/>Tá tú thar a bheith sásta,<br/><br/>Shínigh The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, Aire na Páirce, Crouch End, abhcóide atá ag maireachtáil i nGairdíní Onlow agus triúr ball den Chomhairle Dúiche.<br/><br/>Bhí sé ina cheart lámhaigh ar fud bows na gCoimisinéirí Cóheilit agus a gceannairí reiligiúnacha féin agus an Chomhairle Dúiche, iad go léir in airm ag rá go raibh an séipéal ró-saibhir agus ba chóir dóibh a bheith carthanúil, ní greedy. Bhí an cuimsiú an dá cléirigh ina gluaiseacht shrewd. Cuimhnigh go raibh sé seo fós in airde an conspóid Darwin. Roinneadh Darwin creideamh i teachings an Eaglais agus go mbeadh go leor daoine a bheith i gceannas ar an cumhacht ag an Eaglais ó thaobh an dearcadh sin ina n-aonar., Ní raibh an Eaglais chomh sábháilte mar gheall ar ligean sé a bheith.<br/><br/>An Oíche Nuacht, 7 Meitheamh 1895 dúirt:-<br/><br/>"Mura ndéantar dul i ngleic leis na Comhairleoirí Leictreacha ag an am céanna, gheobhaidh an t-óibhéil foirgneamh greim ar an adhmad a bheidh an-deacair a scaoileadh níos déanaí, ---. Dá bhrí sin, loves sé Londain a bheith suas agus a dhéanamh dá mbeadh siad a shábháil ar cheann de a n-giotaí is aoibhinn de radharcra rustic.

Ba mhór an faoiseamh é go raibh na cónaitheoirí, tuairim is deich mbliana ó shin, chuala siad gur cuireadh tús le ceannach an Adhmaid Uachtarach; agus cé chomh aoibhinn is a bhí seo cruthaithe, is féidir le duine ar bith a thug cuairt orthu fianaise a thabhairt air, ach a bhí ag luí leis na coillte uachtair seo a shábháil ar thaobh thiar de bhóthar Muswell, mhothaigh siad go raibh a bua neamhiomlán chomh fada agus a d’fhan na seasca acra ar an taobh thoir i mbaol. Tá sé, mar a bhí sé, timpiste go bhfuil na coillte roinnte ag bóthar leathan ard., An féidir le duine ar bith a amhras cad é an éifeacht a bheadh a chur in ionad an Eaglais Bun Adhmad ag sraitheanna de Villas beag, a sheoladh gach a chuid deataigh agus mar sin de? An féidir le duine ar bith amhras a thabhairt, freisin, an difríocht thromchúiseach a dhéanfadh sé do shuíomh pictiúrtha na gcoillte ceannaithe dá mbeadh líne le tabhairt faoi thithe nua a reáchtáil ar dheis i gcoinne a sáite duilleach?'<br/><br/>Léirigh sé seo tuairimí a lán daoine. Déanta na fírinne, níor cheannaigh an Coimisiún Cóheilit an scríbhneoir, ach thug sé an t-am don cheantar arís agus arís eile thar na blianta, ach thug formhór na ndaoine neamhaird air. Ní raibh an Coimisiún ag dul a thabhairt ar shiúl an dara adhmad cibé duine a dúirt sé, agus choinnigh sé an seasamh sin go dtí an deireadh.<br/><br/>H.S. Chamberlain, de 5 Gairdíní Cranley, i litir chuig na hAimsithe dar dáta 8 Meitheamh, 1895, a d’áitigh ceannach.<br/><br/>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé coitianta labhairt go mór leis na Coimisinéirí Leictreachas, ach de réir mar iontaobhaithe ciste go bhfuil siad faoi cheangal é a riar chun an leas is mó, agus dá bhrí sin, más rud é go bhfuil sé le déanamh a shábháil ar an scartáil ar an adhmad, is cosúil liom go bhfuil sé beo go hiomlán leis an chosaint ar an maoin saor in aisce agus spásanna oscailte do na daoine, agus, is dóigh liom, a bheadh, a bheith cinnte, a dhiúscairt chun déileáil leis an ábhar a cheannach i saor in aisce agus liobrálachas, mar atá déanta cheana féin ar an Cot-réimse Shepherdánach, trí léas a thabhairt don Chuideachta Súgartha Crouch a bhí mé féin cúpla scaireanna, cuideachta bheag a bhí déanta go heisiach le haghaidh a áirithiú do cruicéad, leadóige srl.<br/><br/>(Tagraíonn sé seo na Réimsí Súgartha Deiridh Crouch a bhí daingnithe cúpla bliain ina dhiaidh sin.)<br/><br/>Mar Chathaoirleach ar Chumann coimeádach Chnoc Mhuire, táim i dteagmháil leis na háitritheoirí i gcónaí, agus is féidir liom a dhearbhú go sábháilte go ndéanfadh gach duine a bhfuil cónaí air sa chomharsanacht aon rud ar chúis le caomhnú.<br/><br/>(Ba é gach duine a theastaigh uaidh ioncam Carthanais go pearsanta chun tacú lena dhaoine bochta. D'éiligh sé a acra talún - ní margadh iontach cinnte - chreid sé nach raibh an t-adhmad i mbaol.)<br/><br/>Ba é Bóthar Chnoc Mhuire ceann de na cinn is fearr in Hornsey agus d’fhanfadh sé chomh hálainn, ag tithe nó ag aon tithe ’,<br/><br/>(agus ansin tháinig an rath mór reitriche.)<br/><br/>'An bhfuil na daoine bochta ag fulaingt mar gheall ar na hagóidí sentimental agus caoin hysterical 'dhá chéile díreach tar éis a ardú ag do fhreagróirí?Ní mór rud éigin a dhéanamh agus go luath. Ní dhéanfadh acra talún cúil leis an gcarthanais aon difear do na tailte atá fágtha, cé go ndéanfadh an brabús a dhíorthaítear uaidh go leor daoine bochta agus tuilltea ina mblianta laghdaithe agus chuirfeadh sé ar ár gcumas eastát a thabhairt dár n-úsáideoirí ar láimh a bheadh i bhfad uainn agus go mór chun cabhair charthanachta a thabhairt dóibh atá dlite do pharóiste Hornsey.’<br/><br/>Cén fáth ar shíl sé go raibh na Coimisinéirí ag iarraidh bóthar a thógáil? Cén fáth ar chaith siad an t-airgead sin ar fad mura dtógann siad tithe? Níor cheap sé riamh gur chaill sé an t-adhmad ar fad ar feadh acra talún. Ach bhí sé leis an bhfadhb ar feadh i bhfad. Ba é an duine dár rinne na Coimisinéirí an tairiscint díola le haghaidh £25,000 bliain roimhe seo agus is é a ainm a dtugtar onóir dó i plaic ar Crouch End Clock Tower chun an t-adhmad a shábháil, ach is cosúil go bhfuil a mhuinín ag na Coimisinéirí Leictreacha dúchais. Tá sé brónach go raibh sé le caitheadh mar an diabhal ag an bhfiosrúchán.<br/><br/>Lean an Fiosrúchán ar aghaidh<br/><br/>Cuireadh tús leis an ócáid arís an 15 Meitheamh 1895 agus cuireadh tús leis an gcéad chruinniú eile, ag súil go n-athródh seomra na Comhairle go hiomlán. Baineadh amach na gnáth-táblaí agus líonfar an seomra le cathaoireacha. Le leath anuas bhí seacht gcinn den seomra plódaithe, agus bhí daoine ag cailleadh suíochán.<br/><br/>Dúirt an tUasal Murray, an Coimisinéir, gurbh aon cheann simplí é an Fiosrúchán. Bhí Carthanais ag iarraidh píosa talún a cheannach in aice lena maoin charthanachta ar chúl. Ba í an cheist an raibh go leor cumhachta ag Coimisiún an Carthanachta, a rialaíonn gach carthanaí, chun stop a chur leo. Bhí na Coimisinéirí eaglaise sásta an talamh a dhíol ag téarmaí an-fhabhracha agus mhéadófaí ioncam an Carthanais go mór.<br/><br/>Ina choinne sin bhí trí aicme agóide ann.<br/><br/>Bhí an Iontaobhas bhunaidh ann chun tithe a sholáthar do na bochtaigh, ach bhí na hIontaobhaithe ag moladh sibhialtaigh a thógáil a bheadh ró-chostasach do na boicht. Mar sin féin, bhí sé laistigh de chumhacht ag na hIontaobhaithe téarmaí an Iontaobhais a athrú, ionas go bhféadfadh siad a thógáil vials má cheap siad go mbeadh an Poor leas sa deireadh. D’fhéadfadh na daoine bochta iad féin a chur i gcoinne, ach bhí forálacha liobrálacha geallta cheana féin dóibh. An tríú agóid a rinneadh i gcoinne an taobh aeistéitiúil agus an taobh phoiblí den cheist. Ghlac sé leis an méid a léigh sé gur chóir do Choimisiún na Carthanachta cur isteach ar na Coimisinéirí Leictreachas a chosc óna rogha féin a fheidhmiú agus iad ag déileáil lena maoin féin.<br/><br/>Phléigh an Fiosrúchán pointí breáa, ach choinnigh na cainteoirí ag teacht ar ais chuig an bpríomhfhadhb maidir le cosc a chur ar aon scrios den adhmad. Rinne an rí-Chléireach d’Iniston, a rinne 300,000 duine, agóid fhoirmiúil faoi aon chuid den choill, chomh luachmhar sin do mhuintir Islington agus Hornsey atá á n-úsáid chun críocha príobháideacha. Dúirt an tUasal Wilfred White go mbeadh na Coimisinéirí a thabhairt dóibh am go mbeadh siad in ann a ardú an t-airgead a chúiteamh na hIontaobhaithe.<br/><br/>An tUasal Beaumont dúirt nach raibh siad ag iarraidh villains, bhí siad ag iarraidh tithe do dhaoine bochta a bhí á dtiomáint amach as an dúiche. Daoine eile a dúirt nach raibh aon airgead ann chun tithe a thógáil chun na cinn atá ag dul i léig faoi láthair a athsholáthar ach ba togra eacnamaíoch é Villas. Thuairiscigh daoine eile go raibh scór de Villas le ligean isteach i Highgate. Bata chun ceist an Adhmaid.<br/><br/>Dúirt an Dr Fletcher gurbh é an caoin i measc na ndaoine oibre ná nach raibh aon áit le dul leis. Tháinig daoine oibre chuige leis an caoin, "Tá muid ag tiomáint as Highgate agus tá oibleagáid orainn dul go dtí Highgate New Town." Más rud é gur díoladh éadan Bhóthar Moswell ní raibh aon cheist ach go bhféadfaí bóithre a ghearradh ar dheis trí na coillte i dtreo Hornsey, ach mura bhféadfadh na Coimisinéirí an talamh a fháil ó Choimisiún na Carthanachta nach bhféadfadh siad an bóthar a ghearradh.<br/><br/>Bhí sé an-cinnte go bhféadfaí na tithe a chur i staid oiriúnach deisiúcháin. D’iarr na póilíní agus roinnt de na ranganna oibre air an dá phointe seo a léiriú, go raibh gá go mór le cóiríocht teachín sin agus go lig siad don talamh a dhíol uair amháin, ní raibh aon insint ann cá bhfanfadh lámh an tógála.<br/><br/>(Ollmhór agus cáiseanna fada).<br/><br/>Labhair go leor daoine eile agus luaigh an Coimisinéir gur ghlac sé leis go raibh an tuairim a bhí ann i bhfabhar na teachín a choinneáil ach níor cheart don chruinniú aon chonclúidí a bhaint as an méid a dúirt sé (Grans).<br/><br/>Daoine eile a dúirt gur theip ar Iontaobhaithe na Carthanachta ina ndualgais trí ligean do na tithe a bheith i dtrioblóid.<br/><br/>An tUasal H.R. Williams, dúirt an tIontaobhaithe a bhí scríofa ag an bpáipéar roimhe sin, go raibh sé ar an údarás is fearr nach ndéanfadh na Coimisinéirí Eaglais aon bhóthar is cuma cad é agus nach mbeadh aon tairbhe acu do iota amháin le gníomhartha na gCoimisinéirí Carthanais. Bhí daoine eile i bhfad níos lú muiníne agus dúnadh an cruinniú tar éis beagnach trí uair an chloig.<br/><br/>'Tá muid ag tabhairt aghaidhe ar an bhfíric go bhfuil i Highgate agus Muswell Hill tá roinnt daoine atá ag iarraidh an Chorpherdy Bottom Wood agus ní bheidh a bheith sásta go dtí go bhfuil siad fuair sé - fad is cosúil go bhfuil aon duine sásta a chaitheamh ar farthing a íoc as é. Deir gach duine gur rud breá é an t-adhmad a bheith aige mar spás oscailte, ach ceapann gach duine gurb é dualgas duine eile é a dhéanamh ceann. Tá ‘réiteach’ ar an ábhar ag The Islington Vestoton, ach ní thairgeann Very pingin i dtreo an cheannaigh. --- Níl aon fhadhb níos deacra don phobal nó don duine aonair a réiteach ná conas seilbh maoine daoine eile a fháil gan íoc as.’<br/><br/>Go deimhin ba í íoc as an fhadhb seo mar gheall ar an diandhíospóireacht áitiúil agus náisiúnta. Cruthaíodh comhchoiste chun airgead a bhailiú chun an t-adhmad a shábháil ar an 20 Samhain 1896, C.F. Scríobh Cory-Wright, Honor Treasure, leis an gCaighdeán, páipéar laethúil ag an am sin, ag déanamh iarratais ar chabhair.Chuimhnigh sé ar gach duine den chontúirt go gcaillfí an t-adhmad agus dúirt sé nach bhféadfaí é a shábháil ach amháin trí é a cheannach. dhíolfadh na Coimisinéirí eaglaise £25,000 agus bheadh gá le (5,000 breise le haghaidh fálaithe agus draenála, ag déanamh £ 30,000 san iomlán.Bhí sé seo i bhfad an iomarca le haghaidh Comhairle Hanssey a ardú ach bhí vóta acu cheana féin £10,000 i dtreo an iomlán. Bhí luach dosheachanta ag baint leis na coillte i dTuaisceart Londain mar sin d'iarr sé ar chomhlachtaí poiblí agus ar dhaoine príobháideacha an £ 20,000 eile a ardú. Thug sé rabhadh nach raibh an tairiscint seo oscailte ach go dtí deireadh na bliana 1898. Tar éis go mbeadh na tógálaithe ag bogadh isteach.<br/><br/>Chuir an preas fáilte chroíúil roimh an achomharc. Rinneadh Bille Príobháideach a rith tríd an bParlaimint agus tríd an Acht um Chaomhnú Páistí Tosaíodh dlí sa Bhille sin. Bhí sé de cheart ag an gCoiste anois fógra a thabhairt maidir le ranníocaíochtaí i leith an Adhmaid a cheannach agus a chaomhnú.<br/><br/>I mbeagán ama, tógadh an t-airgead go léir beagnach, ach bhí an cúpla míle deireanach an-deacair a ardú agus bhí spriocdháta na gCoimisinéirí mar ábhar seachtainí. An tUasal Cory-Wright scríobh phléadáil ar feadh níos mó ama ach tugadh trí mhí ach ansin má íocadh ús ag 4 faoin gcéad ar an tréimhse bhreise ar an tsuim iomlán. Sa deireadh, chuir Comhairle Contae Londain, a bhí ar fáil ar dtús, £ 2,500 de sin i gcrích, agus bhí an t-iomlán bainte amach, ach ba rud dlúth-ról é.<br/><br/>Chinn an Chomhairle an t-athainmniú mar 'Coillte na Banríona' mar onóir don Bhanríon Victoria, Diamond Jubile agus Hornsey, ar taispeáint breá, nuair a dhearbhaigh na Dudes of Albany go foirmiúil, an t-oscailt adhmaid 'chun an pobal a úsáid go saor in aisce'.<br/><br/>Cé gur reáchtáil agus gur threoraigh muintir na háite an feachtas chun adhmad Bun an Teampaill a shábháil a bhraith go paiseanta faoin bpíosa áirithe seo de choillearnach, d’iarr siad cabhair agus taithí líonra mór daoine, agus d’oibrigh cuid acu le chéile ar fheachtais den chineál céanna le breis agus tríocha bliain. D’eisigh an Coiste achomharc, clóite ar pháipéar de chaighdeán an-mhaith agus roinnt ainmneacha cáiliúla a bheith aige.<br/><br/>Bhí ceisteanna a bhain le spás oscailte agus sláinte an phobail ina n-ábhar mór ar fhís Victoria.<br/><br/>An Gluaiseacht Spásanna Oscailte<br/><br/>Bhí an t-aitheoir mór tithíochta, a thosaigh le trí sheanteach i Maigh Nuad, ceannaithe ag Jolm Ruskin, ina saineolaí go tapa ar dhaoine bochta tithíochta sna dálaí is sláintiúla is féidir. Bhí a bealach chun léasanna a cheannach agus ansin dul síos cuid de na tithe plódaithe d’fhonn solas agus aer a thabhairt don chuid eile, ag creidiúint gurbh é aer úr agus solas na gréine an t-aon bhealach a d’fhéadfaí daoine bochta a shábháil ó ‘freastal íonachta. D’fhoghlaim sí é seo mar leanbh óna seanathair, Southwood Smith, a d’fhorbair a chuid teoiric ag Ospidéal na bhFear i gCrois an Rí.<br/><br/>Bhí an chéad Theaghais Thionsclaíoch tógtha aige do dhaoine bochta agus bhí sé cruthaithe go staitistiúil gurbh é an t-aer agus an damhsa mhaith a shábháil saol.Gibson Gardens, i Northworld, toradh díreach é ar smaointe Southwood Smith.<br/><br/>Tábhacht an Aer Oscailte<br/><br/>Bhí spásanna oscailte agus an deis chun aer glan a análú, bhí sé riachtanach do dhaoine a bhí ina gcónaí i seomra amháin nó i dhá sheomra plódaithe. Thug Otvia Hill a cuid táillí ó shlumaí Garrán an Rois ag an am, suas Ascaill Fitzjohn go Hampstead Heath. Bhí grá aici do na páirceanna Ascaill Fitzjohn agus rinne sí iarracht iad a cheannach mar pháirc phoiblí. Bhí costas £ 10,000 orthu agus laistigh de thrí seachtaine Lúnasa tógadh £ 8,500 dá bharr. Ní raibh de dhíth ach deireadh laethanta saoire an tsamhraidh agus an tuairisceán ó laethanta saoire na cairde báúil agus d’ardaigh na £ 1,500 breise, ach tharraingeodh na húinéirí a tairiscint go tobann. In ainneoin na phléadáil go léir, clúdaíodh na réimsí le tithe móra.<br/><br/>Ón méid sin a d’fhorbair an feachtas chun Cnoc na Parlaiminte a shábháil, an chéad spás oscailte eile ó Garrán Lios Tuathail, ag ceannach suas páirceanna ar chonair na dtógálaithe chun sláintíocht bhuan a dhéanamh i gcoinne na brící atá ag dul chun cinn. D’éirigh go maith le feachtas Pháirceanna Chnoc na Parlaiminte gur ritheadh Bille Sláinte Hampstead agus bhí airgead ann ón achomharc. Ón airgead seo agus ó spreagadh i dtreo spásanna oscailte, ba é an Iontaobhas Náisiúnta a fhorbairt a bhí ann. Bhí suim ag Octavia Hill i gceantair mar Chora Bun an Teampaill a chosaint ar feadh na mblianta, agus mar sin bhí sí ina ally nádúrtha sa troid chun an t-adhmad a shábháil.<br/><br/>Bhí eolas ag an gCumann um Chaomhnú an cineál corraithe agus bailiú airgid seo freisin. Bhí siad torn síos fálú nuair a bhí tiarnaí an mainéar píosaí talamh coitianta iamh, as a dtiocfaidh cathanna dlí agus neamhdhleathach araon i gcoinne príobháidiú sotalach talún saor in aisce. Bhí baint ag Robert Hunter, a n-Aturnae Oinigh ó 1868, le spásanna oscailte, móra nó beag a chinntiú don phobal. Bhí sé ina Chathaoirleach ar Achomharc Bun an Eaglais anois. Ba é an tUasal Shaw-Lefeevre MP (níos déanaí an Tiarna Eversley) a d'imir páirt mhór sa obair seo agus feachtais eile i dTeach na dTeachtaí. Bhí baint ag Octavia Hill ina gcuid oibre ó thart ar 1875 i leith.<br/><br/>Ag an am céanna bhí Octavia Hill i mbun feachtais ar son Bille adhlacthaí.<br/><br/>Bhí reiligí cathrach chomh hiomlán agus chomh tromchúiseach sin le sláinte, trí ábhar a thabhairt do dhaoine a tharraing a n-uisce óil, nach raibh reiligí na Cathrach ceadaithe a thuilleadh. Ina ionad sin, cruthaíodh reiligí ar imeall an bhaile. Ceann díobh sin ab ea Ceiliúradh Pháirc na Mainistreach. Ansin bhí gluaiseacht ann chun na ceannchlocha a bhaint de na sean reiligí, chun na coirp a chur isteach arís in áiteanna eile agus chun na reiligí a thiontú ina ngairdíní agus spásanna oscailte, seachas tógáil orthu. Bhí an talamh seo i lár Londain an-luachmhar agus bhí lucht féachana ann: Tógadh an Quakers ceann dá reiligí fiú agus bhí sé i mbaol é sin a dhéanamh arís trí Pháirceanna Bhaile an Mhuilinn a thógáil. Bhí líonra allies i dosaen réimsí ag Octavia Hill, agus mar sin ní mór go raibh sí luachmhar chun an Eaglais Bun Wood a shábháil.<br/><br/>Bhí thart ar dhá chéad gairdín i lár na cathrach leagtha amach ag Cumann Gairdíní na Cathrach, a bunaíodh in 1882, agus thug siad ar láimh do na hÚdaráis Áitiúla ina dhiaidh sin iad, agus mar sin cinnteodh a dtacaíocht d’Achomharc Adhmaid Bun an Churraigh ón tús.<br/><br/>Tá dearmad déanta ag Cumann Chill Airne anois, ach ina lá bhí tionchar mór aige ar reachtaíocht Pleanála Baile agus Spás Oscailte. Bunaíodh an Cumann thart ar 1875 do 'Difffusion of Beauty', chun dath agus spéis a thabhairt isteach i saol na ndaoine atá ina gcónaí i dtimpeallacht dull, tarraing dath geal ar bhallaí agus maisiú, dea-amhránaí, spás oscailte, Nádúr, Litríocht agus Ealaín. Bhí Craobh Maisiúil ann a raibh William Morris le brath air, agus Braisle Ceoil chun cóir agus Oícheantas Sásta a chur chun cinn do dhaoine i bhfoirgnimh áitiúla; agus Brainse Litríochta. Rinne an Cumann achomharc rialta ar litreacha in The Times, go dtí ‘na ranganna is saibhre’ do leabhair agus tréimhseacháin a dháileadh ar chlubanna do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní, ar mhórán tithe agus in áiteanna eile. Tháinig an t-ainm "Kyrle" ón Phápa The Man of Ross, an daonchara a thug a áit bhreithe do na daoine mar pháirc phoiblí. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Aithníodh go bhfuil úsáid alcóil daoine faoi bhun 21 bliain d’aois mar phríomhfhadhb sláinte poiblí.Tugann staidéir faoi deara go méadaíonn sé na rioscaí atá ann do mhíchumas, agus d’fhéadfadh sé a bheith díobhálach don inchinn i mbéal forbartha. Mionaoiseacha ar mó seans go ndéanfaidh deoch féinmharú, briseadh an dlí, nó a bheith ina n-íospartaigh foréigin.Tá alcól i bhfeidhm i mbeagnach aon trian de bhásuithe tráchta i measc an aosa óig. Meastar go bhfuil costas bliantúil iomlán na hól faoi aois ag $ 62 billiún. Cé go dtugtar an chuid is mó de na dlíthe a beartaíodh le hól faoi aois a chosc ar leibhéal an stáit, tugadh gníomhaíocht reachtach agus spéis ar leibhéal na cónaidhme chun tacú le hiarrachtaí stáit an fhadhb a mhaolú. Déantar cur síos sa tuarascáil seo ar mhéid úsáid alcóil faoi aois, gníomhaíocht reachtach le déanaí ar an gceist seo, agus ar impleachtaí éagsúla beartais.

| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Ní brústocaireacht pholaitiúil ná achainí phoiblí a bhí mar thoradh ar athchóiriú bia, ach a raibh saoránaigh i gceannas air chun an chumhacht a chur i bhfeidhm agus leanúint ar aghaidh le hathrú.<br/><br/>Chríochnaigh mé an post ag cur ceist amháin: Cén fáth go bhfuil sé chomh deacair dúinn é seo a dhéanamh dúinn féin, mar dhaoine aonair?
