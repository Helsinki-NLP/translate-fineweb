| Conflicts over water have been accounted for from various sections of the city and firms in Chennai's Information Technology Park have asked workers to either work from home or bring their very own water. The state government and the city's district have accused the emergency of the insufficient Northeast Monsoon in October-November a year ago. They are not totally off-base.<br/><br/>But the reality likewise is that in the previous five years, Chennai's water supply has reliably missed the mark regarding the city's necessity. The Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board had to supply just 830 million liters per day (mld) as against the need of around 1,200 mld.<br/>This year, the organization's water supply plunged to 550 mld.<br/><br/>Chennai city falls in the rain shadow area. It gets more than 80 percent of its water from the Northeast Monsoon. Previously, this water was put away in ponds, waterways, and lakes which would limit the run-off that a beachfront city is vulnerable to.<br/><br/>In addition, as per an investigation by analysts at the geology branch of Chennai's Anna University, the city had in excess of 60 huge water bodies at the turn of the twentieth century. The Buckingham canal and the streams, Adyar and Cooum covered Chennai. At present, Tamil Nadu's capital today has just 28 water bodies, enormous or little.<br/><br/>The Pallikaranai marshland which used to spread over in excess of 6,000 hectares has contracted to around 650 hectares. A parliamentary board that enquired into the reasons for the Chennai floods in 2015, for instance, revealed that that land business had "usurped" the city's water bodies.<br/><br/>Today, Chennai gets its water from four reservoirs, which have gone dry after the retreating monsoon failed a year ago. Chennai's desalination plants can scarcely supply a fifth of the city's water necessities.<br/><br/>Chennai is among the 21 Indian urban areas which the Niti Aayog fears will come up short on groundwater by 2020. The city's water emergency exposes a basic test for the new Jal Shakti ministry.<br/><br/>It needs to assume the main job in settling the strain in India's momentum between the formative needs of individuals and water security goals. The new service should begin by organizing with local experts and authorities in Chennai to revive the city's aquifers. | Tá sé ráite go bhfuil coinbhleachtaí ann in uisce ó chodanna éagsúla den chathair agus gur iarr gnólachtaí i bPáirc Teicneolaíochta Faisnéise na Síne ar oibrithe obair a dhéanamh ón mbaile nó a gcuid uisce féin a thabhairt leo.

| HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has been in use since 1991, but HTML 4.0 (December 1997) was the first standardized version where international characters were given reasonably complete treatment. When an HTML document includes special characters outside the range of seven-bit ASCII two goals are worth considering: the information's integrity, and universal browser display.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>Specifying the document's character encoding<br/><br/>There are several ways to specify which character encoding is used in the document. First, the web server can include the character encoding or "charset" in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Content-Type header, which would typically look like this:[1]<br/><br/>Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1<br/><br/>For HTML it is possible to include this information inside the head element near the top of the document:[2]<br/><br/>XHTML documents have a third option: to express the character encoding via XML declaration, as follows:[3]<br/><br/><?xmlversion="1.0"encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><br/><br/><meta http-equiv="Content-Type"> may be interpreted directly by a browser, like an ordinary HTML tag, or it may be used by the the HTTP server to generate corresponding headers when it serves the document [4]. The HTTP/1.1 header specification for a HTML document must label an appropriate encoding in the Content-Type header,[5] missing charset= parameter results in acceptance of ISO-8859-1 (so HTTP/1.1 formally does not offer such option as an unspecified character encoding), and this specification supersedes all HTML (or XHTML) meta element ones. This can pose a problem if the server generates an incorrect header and one does not have the access or the knowledge to change them.<br/><br/>As each of these methods explain to the receiver how the file being sent should be interpreted, it would be inappropriate for these declarations not to match the actual character encoding used. Because a server usually can't know how a document is encoded—especially if documents are created on different platforms or in different regions—many servers[citation needed] simply do not include a reference to the "charset" in the Content-Type header, thus avoiding making false promises. However, if the document does not specify the encoding either, this may result in the equally bad situation where the user agent displays mojibake because it cannot find out which character encoding was used. Due to widespread and persistent ignorance of HTTP charset= over the Internet (at its server side), WWW Consortium disappointed in HTTP/1.1's strict approach[6] and encourage browser developers to use some fixes in violation of RFC 2616.<br/><br/>If a user agent reads a document with no character encoding information, it can fall back to using some other information. For example, it can rely on the user's settings, either browser-wide or specific for a given document, or it can pick a default encoding based on the user's language. For Western European languages, it is typical and fairly safe to assume Windows-1252, which is similar to ISO-8859-1 but has printable characters in place of some control codes. The consequence of choosing incorrectly is that characters outside the printable ASCII range (32 to 126) usually appear incorrectly. This presents few problems for English-speaking users, but other languages regularly—in some cases, always—require characters outside that range. In CJK environments where there are several different multi-byte encodings in use, auto-detection is also often employed. Finally, browsers usually permit the user to override incorrect charset label manually as well.<br/><br/>It is increasingly common for multilingual websites and websites in non-Western languages to use UTF-8, which allows use of the same encoding for all languages. UTF-16 or UTF-32, which can be used for all languages as well, are less widely used because they can be harder to handle in programming languages that assume a byte-oriented ASCII superset encoding, and they are less efficient for text with a high frequency of ASCII characters, which is usually the case for HTML documents.<br/><br/>Successful viewing of a page is not necessarily an indication that its encoding is specified correctly. If the page's creator and reader are both assuming some platform-specific character encoding, and the server does not send any identifying information, then the reader will nonetheless see the page as the creator intended, but other readers on different platforms or with different native languages will not see the page as intended.<br/><br/>Character references<br/><br/>In addition to native character encodings, characters can also be encoded as character references, which can be numeric character references (decimal or hexadecimal) or character entity references. Character entity references are also sometimes referred to as named entities, or HTML entities for HTML. HTML's usage of character references derives from SGML.<br/><br/>HTML character references<br/><br/>Numeric character references can be in decimal format, &#DD;, where DD is a variable number of decimal digits. Similarly there is a hexadecimal format, &#xHHHH;, where HHHH is a variable number of hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal character references are case-insensitive in HTML. For example, the character 'λ' can be represented as &#955;, &#x03BB; or &#X03bb;. Numeric references always refer to Unicode code points, regardless of the page's encoding. Using numeric references that refer to permanently undefined characters and control characters is forbidden, with the exception of the linefeed, tab, and carriage return characters. That is, characters in the hexadecimal ranges 00–08, 0B–0C, 0E–1F, 7F, and 80–9F cannot be used in an HTML document, not even by reference, so "&#153;", for example, is not allowed. However, for backward compatibility with early HTML authors and browsers that ignored this restriction, raw characters and numeric character references in the 80–9F range are interpreted by some browsers as representing the characters mapped to bytes 80–9F in the Windows-1252 encoding.<br/><br/>Character entity references have the format &name; where "name" is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string. For example, 'λ' can also be encoded as &lambda; in an HTML document. The character entity references &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and &amp; are predefined in HTML and SGML, because <, >, " and & are already used to delimit markup. This notably does not include XML's &apos; (') entity. For a list of all named HTML character entity references, see List of XML and HTML character entity references (approximately 250 entries).<br/><br/>Unnecessary use of HTML character references may significantly reduce HTML readability. If the character encoding for a web page is chosen appropriately then HTML character references are usually only required for a markup delimiting characters mentioned above, and for a few special characters (or not at all if a native Unicode encoding like UTF-8 is used). However, to prevent HTML injection attacks like Cross Site Scripting you should be very careful to use HTML entity escaping properly. If HTML attributes are not fully quoted, then you must entity encode whitespace like space, tab, and others. Other HTML contexts like javascript, css styles, and URLs require different escaping formats. See  for details on each of the different contexts.<br/><br/>XML character references<br/><br/>Unlike traditional HTML with its large range of character entity references, in XML there are only five predefined character entity references. These are used to escape characters that are markup sensitive in certain contexts:[7]<br/><br/>All other character entity references have to be defined before they can be used. For example, use of &eacute; (which gives é, Latin lower-case E with acute accent, U+00E9 in Unicode) in an XML document will generate an error unless the entity has already been defined. XML also requires that the x in hexadecimal numeric references be in lowercase: for example &#xA1b rather than &#XA1b. XHTML, which is an XML application, supports the HTML entity set, along with XML's predefined entities.<br/><br/>However, use of &apos; in XHTML should generally be avoided for compatibility reasons. &#39; or &#x0027; may be used instead.<br/><br/>&amp; has the special problem that it starts with the character to be escaped.

Nuair a chuimsíonn doiciméad HTML carachtair speisialta lasmuigh den raon seacht-giotán ASCII is fiú dhá sprioc a mheas: an fhaisnéis sláine, agus taispeáint bhrabhsálaí uilíoch.<br/><br/>Inneachar<br/><br/>A shonrú ar charachtar an doiciméid ionchódú<br/><br/>Tá bealaí éagsúla ann chun a shonrú cén cineál ionchódú a úsáidtear sa doiciméad.Ar dtús, is féidir leis an bhfreastalaí gréasáin ionchódú an carachtar nó an "carset" a áireamh sa Ceanntásc Aistrithe Hipirtéacs (HTTP) Ábhar-Cineál, a bheadh mar seo de ghnáth:[1]<br/><br/>Content-Cineál: téacs/html; cófra=ISO-8859-1<br/><br/>I gcás HTML is féidir an fhaisnéis seo a áireamh taobh istigh den cheanneilimint in aice le barr an doiciméid:[2].<br/><br/>Tá an tríú rogha ag doiciméid XHTML: an t-ionchódú carachtar a chur in iúl trí dhearbhú XML, mar a leanas: [3]<br/><br/><?xmlversion="1.0" ionchódú=" ISO-8859-1"? >><br/><br/><meta http-equiv ="Is féidir le brabhsálaí, cosúil le gnáth- gclib HTML, nó is féidir leis an bhfreastalaí HTTP a úsáid chun ceanntásca comhfhreagracha a ghiniúint nuair a fhreastalaíonn sé ar an doiciméad [4].

Toisc nach féidir le freastalaí a fháil amach de ghnáth conas a hionchódaítear doiciméad — go háirithe má chruthaítear doiciméid ar ardáin éagsúla nó i réigiúin éagsúla—ní chuimsíonn go leor freastalaithe[ní gá ach luadh] tagairt don "charset" sa cheanntásc Cineál Ábhar, rud a sheachnaíonn gealltanais bhréagacha. Mar sin féin, mura sonraítear sa doiciméad an ionchódú ach an oiread, d’fhéadfadh sé seo a bheith mar thoradh ar an drochstaid chéanna ina thaispeánann an gníomhaire úsáideora mojibake toisc nach féidir leis a fháil amach cén cineál ionchódú a úsáideadh. Mar gheall ar aineolas forleathan agus leanúnach ar Charset HTTP=ar ar an Idirlíon (ar thaobh an fhreastalaí), díomách WWW i gcur chuige docht HTTP/1.1] agus spreagann sé forbróirí bhrabhsálaí chun roinnt socruithe a úsáid de shárú ar RFC 2616.<br/><br/>Má léann gníomhaire úsáideora doiciméad gan aon fhaisnéis faoi ionchódaithe carachtar, is féidir é a titim ar ais go dtí úsáid a bhaint as roinnt faisnéise eile. Mar shampla, is féidir leis brath ar shocruithe an úsáideora, ar fud an bhrabhsálaí nó ar leith le haghaidh doiciméad ar leith, nó féadfaidh sé ionchódú réamhshocraithe a roghnú bunaithe ar theanga an úsáideora. Maidir le teangacha Iarthar na hEorpa, tá sé tipiciúil agus go cothrom sábháilte glacadh le Windows-125, atá cosúil le ISO-8859-1 ach tá carachtair inphriontáilte ann de roinnt cóid rialaithe. Is é an toradh a roghnú go mícheart go bhfuil carachtair lasmuigh den raon ASCII inphriontáilte (32 go 126) le feiceáil de ghnáth go mícheart. Cuireann sé seo roinnt fadhbanna i láthair d’úsáideoirí a labhraíonn Béarla, ach teangacha eile go rialta – i gcásanna áirithe, bíonn carachtair i gcónaí lasmuigh den raon sin. I dtimpeallachtaí CJK ina bhfuil roinnt ionchóduithe il-byte éagsúla in úsáid, is minic a úsáidtear uath-bhrathú freisin.Ar deireadh, ceadaíonn brabhsálaithe an t-úsáideoir lipéad cairte mícheart a shárú de láimh freisin.<br/><br/>Tá sé ag éirí níos coitianta do láithreáin ghréasáin agus láithreáin ghréasáin ilteangacha i dteangacha nach teangacha an Iarthair iad chun UTF-8 a úsáid, rud a ligeann úsáid a bhaint as an ionchódú céanna do gach teanga.

Eascraíonn úsáid tagairtí carachtar HTML as SGML.<br/><br/>tagairtí do charachtar HTML<br/><br/>Is féidir le tagairtí carachtar uimhriúil a bheith i bhformáid deachúil, & #DD;, áit a bhfuil DD líon athraitheach digití deachúil.Mar an gcéanna tá formáid heicsidheach, & #xHHH;, áit a bhfuil HHH líon athraitheach digití heicsidhiúla. Mar shampla, is féidir ionadaíocht a dhéanamh ar na tagairtí do charachtar Hexadeicical i HTML.Mar shampla, is féidir tagairt a dhéanamh i gcónaí do “λ” mar & #955; & #x03BB; nó #X03bb; tagraíonn tagairtí uimhiriúcháin do phointí cód Unicode, beag beann ar ionchódú an leathanaigh.

Is é sin, ní cheadaítear carachtair sna raonta heicseamacha 00-08, 0B–0C, 0E–1F, 7F, agus 80–9F a úsáid i ndoiciméad HTML, ní fiú amháin trí thagairt, mar sin "&#153;", mar shampla. Mar sin féin, chun comhoiriúnacht siar le húdair luath HTML agus brabhsálaithe a neamhaird ar an srian seo, léiríonn carachtair amh agus tagairtí carachtair uimhriúla sa raon 80-9F roinnt brabhsálaithe mar léiriú ar na carachtair atá mapáilte chun bytes 80–9F san ionchódú Windows-12.<br/><br/>Tá an fhormáid agus an t-ainm ag tagairtí d'eintiteas carachtar; nuair is ainm teaghrán alfa-íogair.

Má roghnaítear an t-inchódú carachtar do leathanach gréasáin mar is cuí, ní gnách ach tagairtí do charachtar HTML a theorannú i gcás marcra a luaitear thuas, agus i gcás cúpla carachtar speisialta (nó ní ar chor ar bith má úsáidtear ionchódú dúchais Unicode cosúil le UTF-8). Mar sin féin, chun cosc a chur ar ionsaithe insteallta HTML cosúil le Tras-Scríbhneoireachta Suíomh, ba chóir duit a bheith an-chúramach chun eintiteas HTML a úsáid ag éalú i gceart.Mura luaitear go hiomlán tréithe HTML, ansin ní mór duit spás bánchód mar spás, cluaisín agus daoine eile a chur san áireamh.

Éilíonn XML freisin go bhfuil an x i dtagairtí uimhriúla heicsidhreach in ísle: mar shampla &#xA1b seachas #XA1b.

There are studies that shows that mobile app helps in making student's homework and tasks efficient. Apps like facebook messenger, google drive and many more allows students to conduct group meetings and finish task even at home.<br/><br/>However, if you think that making an app is that difficult, you are wrong. IONIC is the Best Platform for Mobile Hybrid App Development. For a responsive mobile and web-based app development, developers also use the Rapid Application Development model.<br/><br/>Learning and gaining knowledge is a continuous process and nowadays the approach has been changing to elearning where students and teachers maximize the use of technology. Thus, students can learn at their ace and take their time at understanding things, as everything is accessible and one click away.<br/><br/>Below are the Benefits of Using Mobile in Education<br/><br/>It can now be said that students have taken up new ways of learning by using mobile applications. A lot of mobile applications solves up student problems and promote learning. Mobile applications are the future of the education sector, leading towards its development | Na Buntáistí a bhaineann le Iarratais Hibrideacha san Oideachas<br/><br/>3 Aibreán, 2019Lúnasa 5, 2019<br/><br/>Faoi láthair táimid ag maireachtáil in aois dhigiteach ina mbraitheann mórchuid na ndaoine ar a bhfeistí leictreonacha go príomha toisc go ndéanann sé ár saol níos éasca.Má ghlacann tú le breathnú timpeall ort, tá gléasanna soghluaiste ag gach duine. Tá ról mór ag feidhmchláir soghluaiste maidir lenár gcúraimí a dhéanamh níos éasca agus níos gasta. Blianta ó shin, bhí sé ag streachailt le comhoiriúnacht toisc nach n-oibríonn feidhmchlár soghluaiste ach i gcóras oibriúcháin amháin de ghnáth. Ar ámharaí an tsaoil forbraíodh aipeanna hibrideacha inar féidir an aip chéanna a imscaradh i gcórais oibriúcháin éagsúla mar Android, iOS, Windows, agus fiú i mbrabhsálaithe éagsúla mar Chrome, Mozilla, IE, Safari, srl. Mar gheall air seo, bhí tóir níos mó ar aip soghluaiste.<br/><br/>Mar gheall ar aipeanna hibrideacha, baineann níos mó agus níos mó daoine leas as.Tá staidéir ann a léiríonn go gcuidíonn aip soghluaiste le hobair bhaile agus tascanna na mac léinn a dhéanamh go héifeachtúil. Ligeann aipeanna cosúil le teachtaire facebook, tiomáint google agus go leor eile do mhic léinn cruinnithe grúpa a dhéanamh agus tasc a chríochnú fiú sa bhaile.<br/><br/>Mar sin féin, má cheapann tú gurb é aip a dhéanamh go bhfuil sé deacair, tá tú mícheart.Is é IONIC an tArdán is Fearr le haghaidh Forbairt na hÚcráine.
