Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Tar éis nascleanúint a dhéanamh<br/><br/>Bronnadh an Gradam Scríbhneoireachta is Fearr ar "Saol Gan Páipéir"<br/><br/>Tá an tionscadal blagála, “Life With Papers”, a chruthaíonn Len Grant, ina bhfuil scéalta na dteaghlach imirceach gan doiciméad agus na ndaoine óga.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Ceachtana Scoile Sabbath<br/><br/>I nGalataigh, téann Paul i ngleic le saincheisteanna ar nós saoirse, ról an dlí i slánú, ár staid i gCríost, agus nádúr an Spiorad-faoi stiúir an saol, chomh maith leis an cheist d'aois, Cén chaoi ar féidir daoine peacacha a dhéanamh ceart roimh Dhia naofa agus díreach?<br/><br/>Creideann go leor scoláirí gurbh í Gal Gal Gala na litreacha is luaithe de Pól a scríobhadh in AD 49, go gairid tar éis na Comhairle Iarúsailéim cáiliúil (Achtanna 15).

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Lean Linn<br/><br/>An bhfuil tú ag dul<br/><br/>ISPR<br/><br/>Anseo Cad é do chorp ag iarraidh a insint duit<br/><br/>ag<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquesmus<br/><br/>A fháil meáchan ó lasmuigh de rialú cravings ar leataobh, is féidir é a frustrach a bheith acu Hanking leanúnach le haghaidh rud éigin míshláintiúil agus níl a fhios cén fáth. Is é an dea-scéal ná go mbíonn cúis ann de ghnáth gur mian le mála sceallóga prátaí a dhó, nó an mothú go bhféadfá bás a fháil i ndáiríre mura bhfaigheann tú ceart go leor (cé nach bhfuil tú ag iompar clainne). Má tá tú ag radhairc ar bharraí Slí Bó Finne, mar shampla, d’fhéadfadh sé go gciallódh sé go bhfuil cothaitheach an-sonrach in do réim bia á chailleadh agat. (Yup—tá sé níos casta ná an barra seacláide sin a bheith chomh dána delicious.)<br/><br/>Labhair muid le Los Angeles-bhunaithe aiste bia Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., a fháil ar an tanaí ar roinnt cravings bia coitianta, chomh maith le cad is féidir leat a dhéanamh chun an ocras a shásamh gan dul thar bord.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ag craving seacláide<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn sé: D'fhéadfá a bheith in easnamh ar maignéisiam i do aiste bia, a deir Lennewski. "Is mianra riachtanach é Magneseium a bhfuil baint aige le táirgeadh fuinnimh, meitibileacht glúcóis, agus feidhm muscle.Tá sé seo fíor go háirithe dóibh siúd atá ag bualadh go crua an seomra aclaíochta," a mhíníonn sí. Ina theannta sin, leibhéil maignéisiam níos ísle i rith seachtainí réamh-mhíosta do thréimhse, rud a mhíníonn cén fáth a dtagann PMS chomh minic le cravings seacláide.<br/><br/>Ina áit sin, teacht le haghaidh seacláide dorcha ard-chaighdeán, íseal-siúcra atá ard go nádúrtha i maignéisiam. "Mím a mholadh cloí le 75 faoin gcéad cócó nó níos airde, agus é a phéireáil le foinse eile maignéisiam-saibhir mar síolta lus na gréine," a deir Lenchewski. Molann sí an branda seacláide Hu, cuideachta bia beag bhaisc a dhíríonn ar chomhábhair ard-chaighdeán a tháirgtear go háitiúil. "Tá sé beagán daor, ach go léir an chúis níos mó chun codanna a choinneáil i sheiceáil," a deir sí. "Tá sé mo is fearr leat pearsanta." Tá muid freisin lucht leanúna mór de superfood-pacáilte Zenbuni.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ag craving candy<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn sé: "Is comhartha maith é siúcra íon a thiomáint go bhfuil tú ag rith íseal ar fhuinneamh," a deir Lenchewski. "Cad é an rud amháin a bhfuil tú ag itching le haghaidh tar éis oíche uafásach codlata nó timpeall 4 p.m. le linn obair struis? Is é an freagra siúcra de ghnáth toisc go n-úsáidtear é mar bhreosla láithreach le haghaidh cealla ár gcoirp."<br/><br/>Ina áit sin, a bhaint amach do úlla le im cnó "Má tá tú ag raiding do comh-oibrithe' stas candy, molaim níos moille-dóite le foinse saille nó próitéin," a deir Lenchewski. Murab ionann agus siúcra simplí, beidh sé seo mar bhreosla do cealla agus an timpiste iar-siúcra á sheachaint. Dhá roghanna a dhéanamh le haghaidh mór Pioc-m-ups an chéad uair eile a bhfuil tú ag craving candy: úll slisnithe le do rogha de im cnó, nó caora le 2% iógart gréige gan siúcra." Is maith linn fiacla milis a chaitheamh leis na sliseanna cnó cócó addictive, freisin-tá siad ag líonadh, saor in aisce ar aon siúcra breise, agus díreach mar sin go maith.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ag craving salann<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn sé: "Más rud é go mbeidh aon rud ach an picléid is lú, ní féidir leat a bheith ag ól go leor H2O," a deir Lenchewski. "Cuidíonn Salann leis an gcomhlacht a shealbhú ar uisce, mar sin táimid ag crave é nuair a bhíonn muid ag teastáil ó shreabháin."<br/><br/>Ina áit sin, a bhaint amach le haghaidh uisce. "Déan fanacht hiodráitithe, go háirithe mar a théann muid i ngleic leis na míonna an tsamhraidh," a deir sí. An chéad uair eile ama craving ama, iarracht a múchadh é (litearthas) le cúpla spéaclaí refreshing agus d'fhéadfá teacht ar an bpráinnéis go sóidiam beoir imíonn siad. Má tá leamh uisce plain agat, déan iarracht é a mheascadh i mint, líomóid, nó torthaí reoite,” a deir Lenchewski.Agus mura ndéanann sé sin an cleas fós, níl rogha níos sláintiúla ann do sceallóga nó fries Tagged. "Má tá tú i ndáiríre ach salann craving tar éis an tsaoil, tá feamainn tóstaed rogha íseal-calorie mór," a deir sí.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ag iarraidh carbaihiodráití stáirseacha cosúil le pasta<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn sé: "Toisc go gcuireann bianna ard-charbóin leis an serotonin hormón mothú-mhaith, is féidir le cravings stáirse a bheith ina chomhartha atá de dhíth ort ó teanndáileog giúmar," a deir Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Ina áit sin, a bhaint amach le haghaidh folctha! "Ach amach na salainn Epsom, toisc go bhfuil sé in am le haghaidh roinnt tromchúiseach R+R," a deir Lenchewski. "Trust dom. Induling i stáirse saor in aisce-mar gheall ar gach a bhraitheann go maith i láthair na huaire, ach is dócha go mbeidh tú thóin amach níos mó an lá seo chugainn." (Mar dhuine ar bith a bhfuil níos mó ná riamh mar gheall ar pizza nó pasta craving a fhios.) Mar sin, an chéad uair eile is mian leat a Léim ceann ar dtús i mbabhla port, tharraingt folctha, solas coinneal, agus tú féin a chóireáil gan aon aiféala nó calories dlúth.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ag uachtar reoite craving<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn sé: "D'fhéadfadh do chorp a bheith ag insint duit go bhfuil sé de dhíth ar roinnt saille sláintiúil."<br/><br/>Ina áit sin, a bhaint amach do uachtar reoite cnó cócó. "Tá mé réalaíoch, mar sin má tá tú ag craving uachtar reoite, nach bhfuil mé ag dul a mholadh dornán de gallchnó, atá, ar ndóigh, lán de saill sláintiúil," a deir Lenchewski. I gcás éigeandálaí uachtar reoite, molaim uachtar reoite cnó cócó níos ísle i-siúcra cosúil le cnó cócó Bliss nó Kippy’s uachtar reoite trí-chomhábhair i Los Angeles."Is féidir linn dearbhú a dhéanamh ar an bhfíric go bhfuil blas uachtar reoite cnó cócó dochreidte agus díreach cosúil leis an rud fíor.<br/><br/>Má tá tú ag craving le borgaire<br/><br/>Ciallaíonn sé: Ní mór duit iarann a bheith agat. "Mura féidir leat stop a chur ag smaoineamh faoi fheoil dearga, tá seans ann go bhfuil do chorp ag iarraidh iarann, b12 agus aigéad ag dul," a deir Lenchewski "Tá sé seo fíor go háirithe le linn nó timpeall an am sin den mhí."<br/><br/>Ina áit sin, bainim amach le haghaidh borgaire níos sláintiúla. "Tá mé i measc na feola dearg saor ó fhéar, antaibheathaigh agus hormón uair sa tseachtain," a deir Lenchewski. "Déan iarracht triail a bhaint as le borgaire ribe oscailte - a ghearradh, tá sé níos glaine agus tá níos mó iarann ná mairteoil." Ná hithe feoil? Déan iarracht forlíonadh iarainn atá bunaithe ar phlandaí a ionchorprú i do ghnáthamh, cosúil le spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

Ar an drochuair, tá an nascacht agus an tóir leathan seo i measc daoine, tá méadú tagtha ar an idirlíon freisin ar dheiseanna ar choireanna ríomhaireachta. Tugtar ‘Coireanna Cibear’ ar choireanna Idirlín nó ar choireanna ríomhaireachta go forleathan.<br/><br/>Is rud nua é ‘Cibear-Dlíthe’ sa chóras breithiúnach ach tá a lán aire faighte aige le déanaí.Tá an chibearchoireacht an-chomhchiallach leis an gcoireacht thraidisiúnta, is é an t-aon difríocht ná meán forghníomhaithe. Tá dhá chineál cibearchoireachta ann den chuid is mó, is é an chéad cheann ná na príomhspriocanna atá ag ríomhairí agus áirítear orthu seo cásanna a bhaineann le damáiste do shonraí, le cód mailíseach agus le rochtain ar shonraí coiriúla fiú. Is é an dara ceann ina bhfuil ríomhaire ach uirlis ag baint úsáide as a bhfuil coireanna traidisiúnta tiomanta do cibear-sceimhlitheoireacht, spamming, cibear-goid agus go leor eile.<br/><br/>Seo an áit a dtagann comhairleoir láithreán gréasáin nó díoltóir isteach i radharc.Cé nach bhfuil a fhios faoi na dlíthe cibearthe go léir atá i láthair go dtí seo, is féidir le díoltóir láithreán gréasáin comhairle a chur ort faoi chuid de na dlíthe cibeardhlíthiúla is tábhachtaí agus do shuíomh á chruthú.<br/><br/>D’fhéadfadh go mbeadh eolas coitianta ar chearta cóip nó fiú ábhar do shuíomh Gréasáin féin a chosaint san áireamh anseo. Is féidir le díoltóir cabhrú leat freisin trí fhaisnéis a thairiscint duit maidir le cibeardhlíthe éagsúla chun sonraí a chosaint. Chomh maith leis seo go léir, is féidir le díoltóir faisnéis a thairiscint duit faoi aon dlí cibeardhlíthiúil nua nach féidir leat a bheith ar an eolas go dtí seo. D’fhéadfadh sé go n-athróidh dlíthe cibearúla ón náisiún go dtí an náisiún, sampla amháin le déanaí den dlí fianán a scaoileadh sa Ríocht Aontaithe, rud a chuireann cosc ar an suíomh Gréasáin aon sonraí brabhsála úsáideora a shábháil. De réir an Dlí Fianán, ní féidir le suíomhanna Gréasáin sa Ríocht Aontaithe comhaid fianáin a shábháil gan toiliú faisnéise ón surfer.<br/><br/>Is tar éis an dlí sin a chur i bhfeidhm, tá fuinneog aníos ag suíomhanna Gréasáin anois, rud a lorgaíonn toiliú an chuairteora chun comhaid a shábháil. Úsáideann suíomhanna Gréasáin den sórt sin chun anailís a dhéanamh ar phatrún brabhsála na gcuairteoirí bunaithe ar a seoltar fógraí ansin ar fhuinneog úsáideora. Le hacking ní rud nua níos mó do gach duine againn, an gceapann tú gur féidir rialacha agus rialacháin den sórt sin a chosc ar líne brionnú nó cibearchoireacht? Tá teicneolaíocht forbartha ag ráta tapa ach fós ní fearr le daoine siopadóireacht ar líne mar gheall ar eagla go ndéanfaí sonraí pearsanta nó cuntas bainc a hackáil. Leis an méadú ar an gcibearbhulaíocht, tá méadú tagtha ar an ngá atá le dlíthe dochta cibearchoireachta freisin agus chun srian a chur ar an taithí siopadóireachta saor in aisce a chur chun cinn.<br/><br/>Ranganna na gCoireachtaí Cibears<br/><br/>Thar na blianta bhí trí mhór-aicme cibearchoireachta ann:<br/><br/>Rochtain neamhúdaraithe ar chásanna córais ríomhaireachta, lena n-áirítear ainmneacha úsáideora agus pasfhocail a hackáil nó a ghoid chun rochtain a fháil ar fhaisnéis phearsanta an úsáideora faoi seach. Áirítear leis an aicme seo caite cíb a scaoileadh cláir mhailíseacha mar Theach Trojan, worms nó víris ríomhaire etc Cibearstalking úsáideoir nó ciapadh ar líne.<br/><br/>Tionchar díreach na gcoireanna Cibear<br/><br/>Laghdú ar dhíolacháin<br/><br/>Laghdú ar aschur foirne mar gheall ar mhoill ar an líonra<br/><br/>Caillteanas faisnéise pearsanta amhail obair thaighde<br/><br/>Cur isteach ar an bpróiseas cumarsáide<br/><br/>In impleachtaí indíreacha na gcoireanna Cibear<br/><br/>Ceist inchreidteachta inár gcóras airgeadais<br/><br/>Tá an íomhá branda smáithithe ar an margadh<br/><br/>Bíonn tionchar ag coireanna cibearchoireachta ar chaidreamh gnó sa mhargadh<br/><br/>Cailltear tuiscint ar mhuinín i mbeartais stáit agus i ngníomhaireachtaí rialtais<br/><br/>Coireacht Chíbear a Chosc<br/><br/>Ós rud é go bhfuil bearta áirithe ann ba cheart dúinn smaoineamh ar eispéireas sábháilte slán ar líne. Seo cuid acu:<br/><br/>Is é an chéad rud a bheidh le déanamh ná faisnéis phearsanta a choinneáil leat féin agus an rud céanna a roinnt ar líne.<br/><br/>Seachain aon ghrianghraif a roinnt le cairde comhrá ar líne nó le strainséirí.<br/><br/>Is féidir le leagan is déanaí de frithvíreas a shuiteáil ar do chóras líne mhaith cosanta a thairiscint duit i gcoinne bagairtí idirlín cosúil le víris agus malware.<br/><br/>Is rogha maith é do chuid sonraí luachmhara a choinneáil ar ais chun fadhbanna cosúil le éilliú víris a sheachaint.<br/><br/>Seachain faisnéis maidir le cárta creidmheasa a sheoladh chuig láithreáin nach bhfuil cinnte agus nach bhfuil aon deimhniú bailí acu.<br/><br/>Clár sábháilteachta a shuiteáil a thugann smacht duit ar fhianáin láithreáin ghréasáin a rianú.<br/><br/>Trí ghléasanna braite ionraidh bunaithe ar óstaigh a chur ar fhreastalaithe, cabhróidh sé leat súil a choinneáil ar neamhrialtachtaí ar thrácht do shuíomh Gréasáin.<br/><br/>Moltar balla dóiteáin a úsáid.<br/><br/>Cén fáth go bhfuil an oiread sin éilimh ar chibear-ionsaithe?<br/><br/>Níos saoire ná modhanna traidisiúnta caimiléireachta<br/><br/>Níl sé éasca cibearchoireanna a rianú<br/><br/>Ní féidir suíomhanna cruinne a rianú go héasca<br/><br/>Easpa bacainn fisiciúil ar fud an domhain idirlín<br/><br/>Bíonn tionchar ag coireanna cibearchoireachta ar líon mór daoine<br/><br/>Conclúid<br/><br/>Ní féidir an bhfíric go bhfuil cumhacht unfable ag aigne an duine, agus sin an fáth go bhfuil coireanna idirlín ag méadú ar ráta ollmhór. Tá fiú stair tar éis cuid de na nithe slándála idirlín is mó a fheiceáil de réir lámha hackers, a d’éirigh go héasca as. Is é an t-aon bhealach le srian a chur ar choireacht den sórt sin ná a bheith ar an eolas faoi na cibeardlíthe atá againn sa lá atá inniu ann, is féidir sin a bheith trí dhíoltóirí idirlín nó TF. Ní mór an tAcht um Teicneolaíocht Faisnéise a chothromú sa chaoi is go gcruthóidh sé ró-dhian do dhaoine a bhfuil baint acu le cibearchoireanna agus ag an am céanna níor cheart go gcuirfeadh sé isteach ar fhás thionscal an Idirlín riamh.<br/><br/>Údar Bio: – Tá Manet Puri faoi láthair i gceannas ar daingean dearadh gréasáin cáilíochta atá suite ag New Delhi, An India.
