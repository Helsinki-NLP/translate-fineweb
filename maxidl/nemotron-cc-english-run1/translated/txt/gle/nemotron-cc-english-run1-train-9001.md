| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Mar shampla, tá forálacha ag Chlásal 2 de Bhunreacht Mheiriceá gurb é “dlí uachtaracha na Talún” é gach conradh... Cé gur léir nach bhfuil an éifeacht chéanna ag conarthaí ina n-aonar agus atá ag dlíthe cónaidhme. Go deimhin, ní bhíonn siad ag feidhmiú ach nuair a thiocfaidh na forálacha seo i bhfeidhm mar dhlí Cónaidhme le ceadú an tSeanaid agus an Uachtaráin. Cé gurb é seo an cleachtas, is prionsabal é a nglactar go ginearálta leis sa dlí idirnáisiúnta go bhfuil éifeacht ceangailteach ag conarthaí áirithe ar thíortha. Ní mór don chonradh an ceanglas a chomhlíonadh maidir le conradh féinfheidhmiúcháin a mbíonn tionchar aige ar an tír gan aon reachtas comhfhreagrach intíre go díreach.<br/><br/>Seo ardaíonn an cheist maidir le cén conradh a bheidh cáilithe mar "féinfheidhmiú" agus nach mbeidh?<br/><br/>Cibé an conradh féin-fheidhmiúil é nó nach bhfuil cinneadh déanta ag breithiúna náisiúnta ar bhonn cás go cás (Beugernhal, 1992). Chun é seo a thuiscint, féachfaidh an páipéar ar dtús leis an dá chineál teoiric a leanann tíortha ina dhiaidh sin maidir le cineál na gconarthaí a bhaineann leis an dlí baile. Amharcann siad go bunúsach ar chreat an dlí intíre agus idirnáisiúnta mar ordlathas amháin agus dhá ordlathas ar leith, faoi seach (Wildhaber, 1971). Creideann tíortha tar éis monaimisme go bhfuil conarthaí áirithe ceangailteach láithreach agus go bhfuil tionchar acu láithreach ar an tír. Nuair a bheidh an conradh daingnithe, is féidir é a agairt i gcúirteanna náisiúnta agus meastar gur cuid de dhlí na tíre é. Creideann tíortha tar éis déachas nach ndéanann conradh difear don dlí teaghlaigh go dtí go n-athneartaítear é le reachtaíocht a rith sa pharlaimint. Is sampla é an chaoi ar tháinig an Coinbhinsiún Eorpach um Chearta an Duine i bhfeidhm sa Ríocht Aontaithe tar éis dóibh an tAcht um Chearta an Duine 1998 a rith ina bparlaimint (dlíthe, 2000).<br/><br/>Tá an dlí idirnáisiúnta éagsúil, agus is iad na cineálacha nósanna imeachta a leanann tíortha éagsúla chun conarthaí a ghlacadh iad féin a luann roinnt bunreachta na nósanna imeachta maidir le conradh a dhaingniú. Bíonn cóir éagsúil ag tíortha áirithe ar dhlí na gconarthaí idirnáisiúnta agus ar an dlí idirnáisiúnta is gnách.Is minic go mbíonn tionchar ag eagraíochtaí idirnáisiúnta áirithe ar dhlí intíre a Bhallstáit. Ní mór do Bhallstáit an Aontais Eorpaigh éifeacht a thabhairt do chineálacha áirithe reachtaíochta pobail. Cé go bhfuil difríocht riachtanach aige ó chonarthaí féinfheidhmiúcháin. Is í an difríocht ná nach bhfuil sé do bhreithiúna náisiúnta cinneadh a dhéanamh an bhfuil na forálacha féinfheidhmiúcháin nó nach bhfuil, ach don Chúirt Bhreithiúnais Eorpach le léirmhíniú faoina conarthaí comhdhaonnta. Mar sin féin, d’fhéadfadh sé nach mbeadh an éifeacht chéanna ag cineálacha eile dlí idirnáisiúnta a chruthaítear trí rúin nó nach mbeadh an éifeacht chéanna acu do na stáit sin. Mar sin féin, d’fhéadfaidís iad a mheas mar chineálacha “dlí bhog” agus breathnú isteach orthu chun rún an dlí a léirmhíniú. Uaireanta, bíonn tionchar ag forógra arna ndéanamh ag orgáin bhreithiúnacha eagraíochtaí idirnáisiúnta amhail an Chúirt um Chearta an Duine Idir-Mheiriceánach dá gcuid Ballstát. Cé nach bhfuil na dearbhuithe sin ina gceangal ar na Ballstáit, is cosúil go dtagraíonn na breithiúna náisiúnta dóibh sin don léirmhíniú údarásach.<br/><br/>Dá bhrí sin, ní mór cur chuige ar chás-go-cás a ghlacadh agus anailís á déanamh ar na nósanna imeachta agus ar na fasacháin a leagtar síos i dtíortha éagsúla.Chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an coincheap na gconarthaí féin-fhorghníomhú, cuirfidh an páipéar seo i gcomparáid leis na réamhshocruithe a shocraíonn dlínsí éagsúla. Más mian leis an léitheoir anailís chomhchosúil a dhéanamh, is féidir leo é sin a dhéanamh trí bhreathnú ar na cláir náisiúnta éagsúla ar an dlí idirnáisiúnta, den chuid is mó, beidh rannán sna blianta seo atá dírithe ar an gcaidreamh idir an dlí idirnáisiúnta agus náisiúnta.<br/><br/>Dlí agus Cirt Idirnáisiúnta:<br/><br/>Is í an cheist is suntasaí a thagann suas do na cúirteanna náisiúnta ná an bhfuil an conradh féinfheidhmiúcháin? Más féidir an conradh a chur i bhfeidhm gan aon reachtas teaghlaigh breise ar éirigh leis é a threisiú. Tháinig an cheist seo ar bun i gcás Cisteáin Stáit Czesław S v agus Aire an Chisteáin Stáit, inar reáchtáil Cúirt Bunreachtúil na Polainne go raibh forálacha an chonartha dá dtagraítear i mbeart baile á ndéanamh, nach raibh an conradh féinfheidhmiúcháin de chineál (Éileamhna abhainn Bug, Czesław S. State Treasure agus Aire an Chisteáin Stáit, 2003). Go bunúsach, nuair a thagraíonn an conradh do bhearta baile atá le glacadh, ní chruthaíonn sé oibleagáidí nua ina dhiaidh sin. Treisíonn sé ina ionad sin rún an chonartha don phróiseas dlí baile bearta a ghlacadh ar an gcaoi chéanna. Sa chás seo, ardaíodh saincheist den chineál céanna i gcás Soa i Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá, mheas an chúirt gur conradh féinfheidhmiúcháin é an Cúnant Idirnáisiúnta ar Chearta Sibhialta agus Polaitiúla. Tá sé dearbhaithe ag an gCúirt Uachtarach Meiriceánach freisin nach conradh féin-fheidhmiúcháin é an Cúnant Idirnáisiúnta ar Chearta Sibhialta agus Polaitiúla (an Chúirt, 2004). Scrúdaigh Cúirt Uachtarach Chónaidhme na hEilvéise freisin nádúr féin-fhorghníomhú an Cúnant Idirnáisiúnta ar Chearta Sibhialta agus Polaitiúla. Bhí an cheist os comhair na cúirte an raibh Airteagal 13(2)(b) agus (c) féinfheidhmiú sa nádúr. Scrúdaigh an chúirt an raibh an conradh féinfheidhmiúcháin i bpáirt agus rinne sé amhlaidh trí sheiceáil an raibh ábhar lárnach íosta ann don chonradh a bhí infheidhme. Shocraigh an chúirt nach bhfuair sí aon fhoráil den sórt sin laistigh den chonradh (A agus B v Rialtas Cantóin Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>Tá sé riachtanach a thuiscint go bhfuil na saincheisteanna seo difriúil ó cheist bhunúsach an féidir dlí idirnáisiúnta a chur i bhfeidhm mar chuid de dhlí na talún? Chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt, scrúdóidh Cúirt Uachtarach na Poblachta Dhoiminiceach an páipéar. Dhearbhaigh an Chúirt Uachtarach go ndearna Airteagal 3 de Bhunreacht na Poblachta Dhoiminiceach dlí idirnáisiúnta atá ina cheangal ar an ord dlíthiúil intíre. Dhiúltaigh an chúirt do léirmhíniú na Cúirte Talún Ardchúirt gur "reachtas eachtrach" a bhí sna conarthaí sin agus nár chuid den ord dlíthiúil intíre iad. Leag an Chúirt Uachtarach síos gur féidir na conarthaí go léir arna ndaingniú ag an bPoblacht Dhoiminiceach a fhoirceannadh mar chuid den Dlí Dhoiminiceach agus, dá bhrí sin, is féidir iad a úsáid mar féin-fhorghníomhú (Galardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepicón agus ors, 1997). Scrúdaigh Cúirt Uachtarach Chónaidhme na hEilvéise an raibh Conradh Liospóin féinfheidhmiú agus infheidhme go díreach ar Ollscoileanna na hEilvéise. Tá an chúirt ina seilbh, "De réir dlí an cháis ábhartha, tá ord conartha infheidhme go díreach má tá a hábhar beacht go leor agus soiléir chun bonn breithe a chruthú i gcás ar leith. Is é an gnáthrud a chaithfidh a bheith inbhreithnithe,.i. cearta agus oibleagáidí duine aonair a shainiú agus a stiúradh ag na húdaráis inniúla" (X v Ollscoil Lucerne, 2014). Tugann sé seo le tuiscint go bhfuil an conradh infheidhme go díreach nó nach bhfuil, ag brath ar cibé an bhfuil an norm inchosanta.Tá Conradh Liospóin bunaithe ar phrionsabal na gcáilíochtaí a fuarthas ar bord. Ba é an cuspóir a bhí leis seo oibleagáid a chruthú ar stáit a thaispeáint go bhfuil a bpróiseas cinnteoireachta cothrom, trédhearcach agus neamh-idirdhealaitheach. Tá an fhreagracht as a chruthú nár chomhlíon an t-iarratasóir na critéir riachtanacha ar an "comhlacht a dhéanann an measúnú." Ráthaíonn an conradh cosaintí nós imeachta, a nglacann tíortha leo go ginearálta agus dá bhrí sin, reáchtáil an chúirt an conradh seo le feidhmiú go neamhspleách.Déanann sí seo cur síos ar na léirmhínithe éagsúla a dhéanann cúirteanna tíortha éagsúla.<br/><br/>Tá sé riachtanach breathnú an bhfuil na noirm a leagtar amach le conarthaí á gcomhlíonadh i ndáiríre.Tá béim curtha ag dlíthe an cháis ó dhlínse éagsúla gurb iad na cúirteanna náisiúnta an t-údarás deiridh maidir le cé acu an bhfuil conradh féinfheidhmiúcháin. Tá dualgas bunúsach ann freisin a chaitear ar thíortha chun conarthaí a urramú agus a chomhlíonadh go cuí. Déantar é sin a chaitheamh mar a chumhdaítear in Airteagal 26 de Choinbhinsiún Vín maidir le Dlí na gConarthaí (VCLT). Téann Airteagal 27 ar aghaidh lena daingniú nach féidir neamhshuim a dhéanamh d’oibleagáidí dlí idirnáisiúnta trí úsáid a bhaint as dlí baile mar údar. Bhain go leor tíortha úsáid as seo mar fhoinse léirithe, mar Chúirt Bhunreacht na Laitvia. I gcás gnáthchuspóir náisiúnta a bhí ag teacht salach ar ord idirnáisiúnta, reáchtáil an chúirt go raibh an norm náisiúnta ar neamhní. Chun teacht ar a chonclúid, bhí an chúirt ag brath go láidir ar fheidhmíocht riachtanach conarthaí de mheon macánta mar a bhí beartaithe in Airteagal 26 den VCLT (Linija v An Laitvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclúid:<br/><br/>Ón méid thuas, is léir go bhfuil ceanglais ar leith ag conarthaí sula bhféadtar iad a mheas mar fhéinfheidhmiú. Mar sin féin, is é an rud is tábhachtaí fós ná léirmhíniú na gcúirteanna náisiúnta. Cinneann na cúirteanna náisiúnta an féidir féinfhorghníomhú a thabhairt ar an gconradh nó nach féidir. Cé go bhféadfadh foráil a bheith sna Conarthaí maidir le dlí conarthaí arb é dlí uachtarach na talún é, déanann cúirteanna ó thíortha éagsúla na forálacha sin a léirmhíniú ar bhealaí éagsúla. Is féidir féachaint air seo faoin gcaoi a bhfuil na forálacha sin sna Conarthaí Mheiriceá agus Dhoiminiceach ach lean léirithe go hiomlán difriúil dá leithéid. Ní fhéadfaidh an téarma "féinfheidhmiú" a bheith comhleanúnach do na conarthaí seo ós rud é, i gcleachtas, go dteastaíonn formheas uathu fós ó na cúirteanna náisiúnta. Go hidéalach, ba cheart gurb é an bealach ar aghaidh ná go n-admhaíonn tíortha nádúr féin forghníomhaithe na gconarthaí agus go gcaitheann siad leo ar bhealach ina n-urramaítear Airteagal 26 agus Airteagal 27 den VCLT. Arís, is é seo an "idéal" staid agus ní dócha go bhfaighidh sé a bhealach isteach i gcleachtas stáit dlínsí áirithe ag am ar bith go luath. Fós féin, is féidir dóchas a fháil trí bhreathnú ar léirmhíniú na gcúirteanna náisiúnta a léiríonn na noirm sin agus tá súil againn go réiteoidh siad an bealach do chúirteanna eile chun é seo a aithint.<br/><br/>Tagairtí:<br/><br/>Na Conarthaí féinfheidhmiúcháin agus neamh-Fhéinfheidhmeacha i ndlí Náisiúnta agus Idirnáisiúnta (Rial 303). 235 CÚIRT INIÚCHÓIRÍ NA hEORPA AGUS ÓNITHE<br/><br/>Widhaber, L.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Tréithe taobh thiar den tSicne a chuaigh i bhfeidhm ar an Cast Chríost Chríost leis an Ghabháil is Dealg<br/><br/>Cuótaí Iascaireachta Íochtarach<br/><br/>Cé go bhfuil an criú ar Beast Catch a dhéanamh ar an chuid is mó dá gcuid airgid ó Discovery, ní chiallaíonn sin nach bhfuil siad i ndáiríre a dhíol a n-tarlú.

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Féach ar ár mbailiúchán blaganna atá scríofa ag comhbhaill na foirne.<br/><br/>Blagos i gcomhair faisnéise<br/><br/>Ná Strus sé<br/><br/>ag<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Samhain 12, 2020<br/><br/>Strus, is cuma cé chomh hiontach atá rudaí ag dul, is féidir é a fháil i gcónaí ar bhealach a chúl a ceann ghránna.Cibé an bhfuil sé ar iarratas poist deireanach nóiméad nó páipéar a d'fhéach tú a scríobh agus tá sé mar gheall ar an lá seo chugainn, is féidir strus a fháil i gcónaí ar bhealach isteach i do lá má cheadaíonn tú é. Sa lá atá inniu beidh mé a thaispeáint duit roinnt rudaí is féidir leat a dhéanamh chun deireadh a chur nó strus a chosc.<br/><br/>Is é an chéad rud is féidir leat a dhéanamh ná aclaíocht a dhéanamh.Is bealach iontach é aclaíocht chun strus a mhaolú toisc go laghdaíonn sé an hormón strus i do chorp ar a dtugtar cortól.Beidh na leibhéil níos ísle truaillithe i do chorp, an leibhéal níos ísle do strus. Féadann aclaíocht do mhuinín a mhéadú freisin, agus nuair a bhíonn do mhuinín suas ansin bíonn do strus síos de ghnáth. Maidir liom féin, nuair a rachaidh mé i strus, déanaim a fheidhmiú i gcónaí trí dhul chuig an seomra aclaíochta agus an dornálaíocht a chleachtadh, cabhraíonn sé liom calories a dhó agus strus a laghdú agus spraoi a bheith agam.<br/><br/>Is bealach é rudaí a scríobh síos chun daoine a mhaolú ar feadh tréimhse an-fhada, agus is é an chéad topaic eile ar ár liosta.Is bealach é an intinn a scríobh síos, agus cabhraíonn sé le fáil réidh le strus freisin. Tá taithí den chineál céanna agam agus scéalta á scríobh agam, de ghnáth mura féidir liom smaoineamh ar smaoineamh nua mar gheall ar shean-smaoineamh amháin, scríobhfaidh mé an seansmaoineamh síos agus smaoinigh air. Is é sin nuair a thosaíonn smaointe nua ag teacht aníos agus is féidir liom leanúint ar aghaidh ag scríobh de ghnáth. Tá sé mar an gcéanna le strus. Smaoinigh faoi shruth leanann sé ag sreabhadh síos go dtí go mbuaileann sé le damba beanna, agus go gcuireann damba bac ar shreabhadh an uisce agus go dtosaíonn gach rud ag tógáil suas.Is é an t-aon bhealach chun an sreabhadh uisce a fháil ar ais go gnáth ná an damba a bhaint. Seo an áit a dtagann an scríbhneoireacht isteach. Nuair a scríobhann tú síos é, tá tú ag baint an píosa struis le píosa go dtí gur féidir leat smaoineamh de ghnáth arís.<br/><br/>Is féidir le strus teacht isteach inár saol trí dhoirse inár saol a choinníonn muid ar oscailt.Is bealach é an phráthú gur féidir linn na doirse a fhágáil ar oscailt le haghaidh strus. Ag fanacht go dtí an amárach d'fhéadfadh a bheith spraoi don lá atá inniu ann, ach beidh sé Gortaítear tú amárach, agus tá sé ar réiteach an-ghearr-radh. An níos faide a fhanann tú chun rud éigin a dhéanamh, is mó a bhíonn rud éigin ann, agus is mó an strus a bheidh tú ag tabhairt cuireadh isteach i do shaol. Ag tabhairt aire do rud éigin chomh luath agus a fhaigheann muid go bhfuil sé ar bhealach iontach chun strus a chosc, ach tá sé rud éigin a thógann smacht mór a dhéanamh., An níos mó a ghearrann tú Prasa as do shaol, an níos strus a bheidh tú saor in aisce. Mar sin, stoptar an doras, tá tú ag ligean go léir an aer fuar amach.<br/><br/>Mar sin, a ligean ar athbhreithniú: A fheidhmiú, Scríobh síos cad atá ag cur béime ort, agus Ná Próstatach.Is iad seo ach cúpla bealach chun strus a mhaolú ach domsa, is iad na cinn is éifeachtaí. Cé go bhfuil a fhios agam nach mb’fhéidir nach n-oibreoidh siad seo do gach duine ba mhaith liom cuireadh a thabhairt do dhuine ar bith a bhraitheann go bhfuil béim air i dtaobh taighde a dhéanamh ar conas fáil réidh leis. |
