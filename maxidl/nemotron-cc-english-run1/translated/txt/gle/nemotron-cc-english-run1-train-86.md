| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Lecléire<br/><br/>Bhunaigh "fo" Edwardsville mar phobal comhoibritheach sa bhliain 1890 agus d’fhan sé sráidbhaile ar leith go dtí cathair Edwardsville i 1934. Rinne nuachtáin agus irisí ar fud na Stát Aontaithe agus na hEorpa tuairisciú ar an turgnamh Lecaire, go háirithe le linn an chéad 20 bliain de bheith ann. I 1979, mar gheall ar a stair uathúil, bhí an seanbhaile liostaithe ar Chlár Náisiúnta na nÁiteanna Stairiúla.<br/><br/>Bhunaigh Nelson Oliver Nelson Nelson, monaróir pluiméireachta St. Louis a bhí ag iarraidh, le blianta fada, solas an ranga oibre a chur chun cinn. Bhí Nelson ag iarraidh dálaí oibre a fheabhsú dá chuid fostaithe agus tithíocht a sholáthar in aice leis na monarchana ionas go bhféadfadh oibrithe agus a dteaghlaigh páirt a ghlacadh go héasca i gcláir áineasa agus oideachais a thairgeann an chuideachta saor in aisce. Roimh 1890, agus iad fós i St. Louis, thosaigh gnóthais déantúsaíochta agus dáileacháin N. O. Nelson Company ag soláthar comhroinnt brabúis chomh maith le deiseanna oideachais agus áineasa. Bheadh tairbhí breise ag baint le turgnamh comhoibritheach Lecaire.<br/><br/>Nuair a léirigh fostaithe Nelson go raibh siad ag iarraidh athlonnú chuig suíomh tuaithe, chuaigh ionadaithe cuideachta chuig ceannairí bailte beaga i roinnt pobal Missouri agus Illinois in aice lena gceanncheathrú i St Louis. Bhí siad ag lorg maoine oiriúnach chun monarchana nua agus sráidbhaile múnla a thógáil. South of Edwardsville fuair siad conradh talún 125 acra le rochtain ar uisce, gual agus iompar. Ghníomhaigh gnólachtaí áitiúla go tapa chun dreasacht airgeadais a thairiscint. I níos lú ná trí seachtaine, d'ardaigh an pobal ciste de $ 20,000 ó ranníocaíochtaí aonair idir $ 1 agus $ 1,000 a mhealladh Nelson a roghnú le haghaidh a fhiontair.<br/><br/>Bhí súil ag ceannairí na cathrach maoin a aimsiú taobh istigh de theorainneacha na cathrach Edwardsville, ach nuair nach bhféadfaí teacht ar aon láithreán oiriúnach, bhí siad muiníneach go ndéanfadh an infheistíocht Nelson ó dheas ón mbaile a bheith ina chuid de Edwardsville go luath. Cé gur chomhlíon Nelson na teagmhais uile le haghaidh tógála agus cruthú fostaíochta ina chonradh, bheadh sé 44 bliana sular cuireadh Edwardsville i gceangal leis. Ba sráidbhaile neamhspleách é Lecaire, faoi cheangal ag Madison/Brown Ascaill na h-oirthear, na rianta railroad go dtí an t-iarthar, Hedley/McKinley Ascaill ar an taobh ó dheas agus ó Shráid an Domhain go dtí an taobh ó thuaidh. Le linn an ama sin, thuill sé clú ar nuálaíochtaí i gcúrsaí gnó, oideachais agus pleanála cónaithe.<br/><br/>An sráidbhaile Lecaire ar léarscáil 1931 de Edwardsville<br/>Le caoinchead Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Faoi dheireadh na 1880idí, bhí sé ina cheannaire idirnáisiúnta i réimsí an chomhair agus na comhroinnte brabúis, ag malartú teoiricí sóisialta le daoine eile ar fud an domhain agus ag leathnú a ghnó St. Louis. D'ainmnigh sé a sráidbhaile turgnamhach tar éis an comhroinnte brabúis i bPáras, Edme Jean Lecaire, ach thug sé cuairt ar go leor fístéipeanna sóisialta eile a chuir eolas agus inspioráid ar fáil. Agus na smaointe is fearr á gcur i gcrích aige ó na samplaí seo, bhunaigh Nelson Lecaire, ina chuid focal, "obair a thabhairt, faisnéis a chur chun cinn, caitheamh aimsire a sholáthar, áilleacht a chothú, agus tithe a dhéanamh." Ina dhiaidh sin bhain scríbhneoirí úsáid as na focail seo chun bunphrionsabail Leclóirí a fhoirmiú: Obair, Tithe, Oideachas, Áineas, agus Áilleacht, ach le prionsabal tábhachtach breise Saoirse.<br/><br/>Obair<br/><br/>D’fhéadfaí an obair a mheas mar an rud is tábhachtaí de na fachtóirí seo ó tharla nach mbeadh aon sráidbhaile gan poist na monarchan. Rinne an t-ailtire E. A. Cameron na foirgnimh monarchan brící a dhearadh chun solas nádúrtha, aerála sa samhradh a sholáthar, agus urláir téite sa gheimhreadh. Bhí córas faoi chois dóiteáin agus, cé nár cuireadh deireadh le timpistí tionsclaíocha, rinneadh gach iarracht sábháilteacht na n-oibrithe a ráthú. I 1894, thug an tuairisceoir New York World Nellie Bly, rogha idéalach d’fhoirgnimh an fhir i mbun oibre. Bhí na foirgnimh timpeallaithe ag faichidí agus gairdíní bláthanna a bhí maisithe go maith agus a thug cuma chasta ar an gcampas.<br/><br/>An coimpléasc déantúsaíochta de chuid na Cuideachta Déantúsaíochta N. O. Nelson i Leclaire<br/>Ó Chairde de Lecaire<br/><br/>Dearadh beartais cuideachta Nelson chun cobhsaíocht airgeadais na bhfostaithe a chosaint.D'fhéadfadh oibrithe sciar de na brabúis a thuilleamh agus guth a bheith acu sa chuideachta má roghnaigh siad an rogha sin. Thug an plean comhroinnte brabúis bród úinéireachta d'fhostaithe Nelson a raibh fórsa saothair tacúil mar thoradh air. Bhí cúpla stailceanna saothair gearrshaolacha ann thar na blianta, ach den chuid is mó bhí fadhbanna saothair annamh. Bhí uaireanta réasúnta agus pá iomaíoch ag oibrithe chomh maith. Bhí ciste soláthair ann a chuir ar fáil le haghaidh pinsin agus saoire bhreoiteachta, chomh maith le pinsin bhaintreach má fuair oibrí bás, cibé acu a bhain nó nach raibh baint ag an bás lena fhostaíocht.<br/><br/>Bhí ceanncheathrú na Cuideachta don N. O. Nelson Company (NOCO) fós i St. Louis, ach aistríodh gach ceann de na Cuideachta Déantúsaíochta N.O. Nelson go Leclier. Bhí an chuideachta déantúsaíochta roinnte i siopaí a rinne éagsúlacht táirgí. I 1900, tháinig na siopaí ar chuideachtaí neamhspleácha chun críocha cánach, ach bhí siad go léir fós faoi úinéireacht ag an N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. I measc na siopaí bhí an Mill Comh-Aireachta inar táirgeadh táirgí adhmaid ó chaibinéir go bainne. Chomh maith leis sin, comhlíon na ceardaithe oilte a d’oibrigh anseo conarthaí speisialta, lena n-áirítear cages lucht siúil chuig banc áitiúil agus altóir atá fós in úsáid ag Eaglais Easpaig Naomh Andrew i Edwardsville. Tá an Siopa Marmair speisialaithe i marmair ailtireachta a ghearr agus a shuiteáil ag foirne Nelson i dtithe, gnólachtaí, agus fiú caipitil stáit ar fud an Midwest. Rinne an Siopa Meaisín, a tháinig chun bheith Bigall agus Keeler, meaisíní feistis píopaí, caidéil, tomhasairí, agus uirlisí meicniúla éagsúla a bhí ag súil leis sa trádáil pluiméireachta.Braol siad amach freisin chun míreanna speisialtachta a mhonarú cosúil leis an Rothar Leicléireach i lár na 1890idí. Ar an Siopa Práis bhí teilgcheárta ina ndearnadh píopaí agus uirlisí éagsúla pluiméireachta.Níl sna samplaí seo ach cuid den obair a rinneadh sna monarchana Lecaire. Ba é lógó na cuideachta "NOCO" is féidir a fheiceáil go fóill ar daingneáin pluiméireachta agus roinnt hidrealaithe dóiteáin i Edwardsville inniu.<br/><br/>Tithe<br/><br/>Sula bhféadfaí tithe a thógáil, bhí gá le tithíocht d’oibrithe a bhí ag críochnú na bhfoirgneamh monarchan chomh maith le tithe a thógáil. Chomh maith le lóistín, ba é an chéad fhoirgneamh oideachais den phobal é, agus bhí leabharlann dea-shonraithe ann.<br/><br/>Cuireadh tús le tógáil na coda cónaithe de Lecliare díreach tar éis don sráidbhaile a bheith bunaithe i mí an Mheithimh 1890. bhunaigh Julius Pitzman, an t-ailtire tírdhreacha nuálach a leag amach na chéad bheart i Leclaire, roinnt cúnant cosanta dóibh. Is iad na cumantálacha a sholáthraítear do shráideanna leathana, áithnóirí, go leor móra, agus srian ghníomhase a chuireann teorainn leis na hairíonna do chúiseanna cónaithe nó oideachais amháin. D'ullmhaigh an chuideachta na sráideanna, chuir sí soilse sráide leictreacha ar fáil, chuir sí ballaí taobh, agus na céadta crainn suite ar shráideanna Lecaire. Leagadh amach codanna níos déanaí de Leclier le dearadh greille traidisiúnta agus go leor níos lú, ach fós san áireamh na srianta ghníomhas.<br/><br/>Teachín Lecléiche Victeoiriach i 1907<br/>Ó Cindy reinhardt<br/><br/>Ar dtús thóg an chuideachta na tithe agus ansin dhíol siad gar d’fhostaithe Nelson chun úinéireacht tí a spreagadh. Dá dtarlódh oibrí d’éirigh tinn agus níorbh fhéidir leis a mhorgáiste a dhéanamh, cuireadh íocaíochtaí ar fionraí go dtí go ndeachaigh sé ar ais ag obair. Cuireadh na tithe ar fáil i ndearaí tithe éagsúla agus d’fhógair an comhlacht nach raibh aon dá theach cónaithe ar aon nós. Ba iad na tithe is luaithe a bhíodh lonnaithe go príomha sna tithe Victeoiriacha a tháinig le leictreachas agus le huisce reatha. Ina dhiaidh sin bhí bungalónna, ceithre chearnóga, agus fiú roinnt tithe cistine.D’fhéadfadh cónaitheoirí teach atá tógtha ag an gcuideachta a cheannach nó teach folamh a cheannach agus teach a thógáil iad féin, ar choinníoll go gcomhlíonann an dearadh ailtireachta caighdeáin na cuideachta.<br/><br/>Le blianta beaga anuas, dhíol go leor le hinfheisteoirí, cónaitheoirí Edwardsville de ghnáth, agus thóg conraitheoirí áitiúla go leor tithe sna 1920idí iad ansin a dhíol le cónaitheoirí i gceantar.<br/><br/>Oideachas<br/><br/>Chreid Nelson sa chóras oideachais do gach duine, lena n-áirítear an rang oibre. Thosaigh an clár oideachais le kindergarten ag Teach an Chlub sa bhliain 1892 agus lean sé ar aghaidh ag tógáil oideachais nua ag 722 Bóthar Naofa. Ar a dtugtar “Teach na Scoile” de ghnáth, chuir an foirgneamh seo halla mór le haghaidh cruinnithe agus cláir, ach bhí siad in ann é a roinnt ina spás ranga i rith an lae. Sna tráthnónta, bhí damhsa, cruinnithe, nó cláir de Chlub Féin-chultúrtha le feiceáil i léachtaí seachtainiúla ag próiseálaithe Ollscoil Washington nó ag cainteoirí aitheanta náisiúnta a bhí, cosúil le N. O. Nelson, mar chuid den ghluaiseacht fheabhsaithe sóisialta ag casadh an chéid. Ina measc seo bhí Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, agus údar Charlotte Perkins Gilman, i measc daoine eile.<br/><br/>Páistí atá cláraithe sa Chlárlann in 1913.<br/>Ó Cindy reinhardt<br/><br/>Sna deich mbliana tar éis tógáil an fhoirgnimh oideachais 1895, bhí sraith thurgnaimh oideachais ann lena n-áirítear scoil thionsclaíoch, coláiste, scoil oíche, agus mac léinn. Ba é an t-iarracht is luaithe agus is faide a mhair an kindergarten maidin, a bunaíodh i 1892, a d’úsáid an tSamhail Fröbel. Bhí an clár dhá bhliain seo saor in aisce do gach duine, lena n-áirítear leanaí Edwardsville, go dtí 1931 nuair a thosaigh an chuideachta ar theagasc a mhuirearú do mhic léinn nach raibh leanaí fostaithe acu. D’oibrigh Nelson Manufacturing áit chónaithe phríobháideach go dtí 1934 nuair a rinneadh an foirgneamh a thiontú go ceantar Scoil Edwardsville ar tháille ainmniúil.<br/><br/>Caitheamh Aimsire<br/><br/>Bádóírí ar Loch Cléireach i 1915<br/>Ó Cindy reinhardt<br/><br/>Gné thábhachtach de Leclier a bhí sa tseirbhís fóillíochta. Chuir an chuideachta áiseanna spóirt ar fáil le haghaidh baseball, leadóg, agus níos déanaí, peil. Tógadh babhla agus halla billiard agus bhí loch le haghaidh bádóireacht, snámh, iascaireacht nó scátáil oighir sa gheimhreadh. Cuireadh tithe baistí ar fáil i bPáirc an Chláraigh, tithe folctha fireanna & baineann, agus pailliúin mhór. D’eagraigh cónaitheoirí damhsa, féara, beacha litrithe, agus gníomhaíochtaí eile, agus rinne an chuideachta urraíocht ar bhanna a d’imir go rialta ag siamsa sa sráidbhaile nó i Edwardsville. Cosúil leis na feidhmeanna oideachais i dTeach an Chlub agus i dTeach na Scoile, bhí na háiseanna áineasa ag an uile dhuine agus is minic a bhí siad mar cheann scríbe do chuairteoirí Edwardsville agus fiú St. Louis.<br/><br/>Áilleacht<br/><br/>Grianghraf luath de Loch Cléireach<br/>Ó Cindy reinhardt<br/><br/>An ceann deireanach de na fachtóirí a measadh a bheith tábhachtach do shaol sásúil lena mbaineann an comhshaol. Thug sé luach ar an áilleacht agus ar an glaineacht a d’fhéadfaí a fháil sa tír, agus spreagadh do gach duine i Leclarie a gcuid maoine a iompar trí ghairdíní agus úllord a shuíomh. Bhí Nelson ann féin faoi stiúir sampla, mar sin bhí bláthanna saor in aisce agus comórtais ar siúl do na clós is áille. Leagadh leLecaire amach ionas go raibh suíomh páirc cosúil leis an sráidbhaile le feiceáil go fóill inniu.<br/><br/>Saoirse<br/><br/>Siopa comharchumann Lecaire<br/>Ó Cindy reinhardt<br/><br/>Chuir na scríbhneoirí nua-aimseartha seo a leanas cúig phrionsabal bunaithe do Leclaire, ach chuir siad an séú chlár ar fáil: Saoirse, Bhí na cláir go léir a thairgeann an chuideachta ar fáil d’fhostaithe chomh maith le cónaitheoirí áitiúla, ach ní raibh aon cheann acu éigeantach. Ní raibh an tsaoirse ann a roghnú cé acu a ghlac nó nár ghlac an duine páirt i gcláir chuideachta go hiomlán i gcás an duine aonair. Bhí rannpháirtíocht i gcláir áineasa agus oideachais roghnach freisin.Bhí siopa cuideachta ann freisin ina bhféadfadh fostaithe siopadóireacht a dhéanamh, ach murab ionann agus bailte cuideachta eile, ní raibh aon duine i bhfiacha ag siopa na cuideachta. Comhoibríoch a bhí sa Siopa Leclia áit a ngearradh praghsanna margaidh córa ar bhaill, ach a íocadh díbhinní ráithiúla ansin.<br/><br/>A Baile Cuideachta Éagsúla<br/><br/>Ach bhí cásanna aonair ann inar léirigh an chuideachta comhbhá agus aire do na fostaithe, mar gheall ar na buntáistí seo go léir. Dúnadh an comhlacht na monarchana agus d'fhostaigh sí traenacha chun oibrithe a ghlacadh agus a dteaghlaigh ar feadh lae ag Aonach Shaol na St. Louis sa bhliain 1904. Nuair a bhí airgead daingean, chuirfeadh Nelson airgead breise i ngach clúdach pá ó am go chéile chun an saol a dhéanamh níos éasca d’oibrithe, agus má d’aithin sé clár nár aontaigh na fir leis, labhair siad amach é agus, chomh minic nach raibh, bheadh Nelson ag athrú é féin.<br/><br/>B'fhear casta é N. O. Nelson a rugadh i Lilland, sa bhliain 1841, agus bhí sé ina phríomhchathair, a chreid i saorfhiontar, ach ina chumannaí freisin, ina lucht leanúna de chuid an "Rial Órga", agus ina tírghráthóir a d'fhóin don Aontas sa Chogadh Cathartha. Faoi 1900, bhí sé ina millionaire, ach faoi aimsir a bháis in 1922, thug sé é ar fad ar mhaithe le feabhas a chur ar an rang oibre.<br/><br/>Cé nach raibh Lecaire mar thástáil shóisialta amháin ag Nelson, meastar gurb é an iarracht is rathúla a rinne sé. I measc na mór-iarrachtaí eile a rinneadh ar mhaithe le leas sóisialta bhí slabhra siopaí grósaera chomhoibríocha i New Orleans, gairdín do leanaí d’fhostaithe dubha ina Bhéimséir, i Alabama, i monarchana agus ina bhaile le haghaidh cultacha san India, California.<br/><br/>Tugadh cáil idirnáisiúnta ar Sráidbhaile Nelson de Leclaire go hidirnáisiúnta mar turgnamh suntasach rathúil. Cuireadh síos air i Nua-Eabhrac ar go leor ócáidí ach go háirithe leis an tuairisceoir Nellie Bly i 1894 a scríobh ar fhad faoin mbaile múnla ina réitítear an cheist saothair agus gach duine sona i sráidbhaile beag in aice le St. Louis." Thuairiscigh an Los Angeles Times go rialta freisin ar an N. O. Nelson go ndearna an Tribune Laethúil Chicago agus go leor foilseachán eile.<br/><br/>I óráid ag ceiliúradh 15 bliain le Lecliera i 1915, dúirt Nelson, "Lecaire leathnaíonn tú fáilteachais oscailte leathan, agus cuireann tú taitneamh as inniu an éascaíocht agus an chompord agus an áilleacht agus inspioráid a thaitníonn linn gach lá." Tá níos mó ná céad bliain caite ón lá sin, ach tugtar cuireadh do chónaitheoirí agus do thaighdeoirí foghlaim faoi stair Lecaire agus machnamh a dhéanamh ar na ceachtanna a d’fhéadfaí a fhoghlaim chun feabhas a chur ar na glúnta atá le teacht.<br/><br/>Ceann de na foirgnimh iar-choimpléasc déantúsaíochta in 2019, a fhreastalaíonn anois mar Campas N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Údar Cuairteanna trí Zoom nó Skype<br/><br/>Tá mé ar bís cuairt a thabhairt le do mhic léinn trí Zoom nó Skype!Is rogha iontach é Skype do scoileanna / ranganna nach bhfuil ag tabhairt údair phearsanta, ach atá ag iarraidh leabhair agus filíocht a iniúchadh, ceangal a dhéanamh le húdar, agus ceisteanna duine le duine a chur.<br/><br/>Costas<br/><br/>Cuirfidh mé cuairteanna ar Zoom 30-45 nóiméad nó Skype ar fáil le scoileanna le haghaidh $ 125 in aghaidh an tseisiúin (nó $ 200 ar feadh dhá sheisiún a tharlaíonn laistigh de thrí uair an chloig ar maidin nó an tráthnóna; $ 325 ar feadh trí sheisiún in aon lá amháin; $ 425 ar feadh ceithre sheisiún in aon lá amháin).

B’fhéidir nach gcuirfeadh an t-am isteach i gceart, rud a fhágann gur dúshlán atá i gceist le chéile é, agus tá sé an-deacair dom éisteacht le mic léinn aonair mura dtagann siad suas agus mura labhraíonn siad go díreach isteach sa mhicreafón/ríomhaireacht. Ach tar éis roinnt trialach agus earráide, fuair mé roinnt bealaí a bheith acu ar na cuairteanna fíorúla is fearr is féidir.Seo iad: 10 mbealach chun mo chuairt a dhéanamh le do mhic léinn taithí iontach!<br/><br/>Roimh an gcuairt<br/><br/>Faigh na páistí chomh corraithe agus is féidir faoin gcuairt.

Beidh aon rud a dhéanann tú chun tosaigh ar an am chun go mbraitheann sé cosúil le Dia BIG ag dul i bhfad i dtreo rannpháirtíocht na mac léinn.<br/><br/>Suíomh an ceamara físe nó an ríomhaire glúine le ceamara gréasáin ionas gur féidir liom an oiread den lucht féachana agus is féidir a fheiceáil.Tá sé deacair dul i ngleic le mic léinn nuair nach féidir liom ach cúpla mac léinn a fheiceáil.<br/><br/>Cuir teorainn le gach grúpa go 50 dalta.Tá sé thar a bheith deacair grúpaí móra a fhostú trí fhíseán.<br/><br/>Déanfaidh mé bogadh go tapa ó thopaic go hábhar nó ó dhán go dán. Cuir i gcuimhne do na daltaí go mbeidh orthu éisteacht go dlúth le tuiscint a fháil ar a bhfuil ar siúl.<br/><br/>Ó am go chéile, déanaim beagán Amharclann na Léitheoirí a dhéanamh leis na mic léinn.Má sheolaim aon chodanna clóite de na mic léinn chugat roimh an am, priontáil cóip don seisiún REACH agus gearrtha isteach i bpíosaí, más gá.<br/><br/>Le linn na Cuairte<br/><br/>Nuair a phléaim leabhar, má tá an leabhar clóite sin agat, coinnigh suas é le do thoil le go bhfeicfidh an scoláire é.<br/><br/>Is tusa mo sheachvótálaí. Is minic nach féidir liom glaoch ar mhic léinn agus freagraí aonair a chloisteáil. Mar sin, d'fhéadfadh mé a rá, "Tá muid ag dul a fháil 3 smaointe. Ardaigh do lámh má tá tú smaoineamh." Ansin tógann tú níos mó, glaoigh ar thrí mhac léinn, agus fógra a thabhairt faoi na freagraí sin do gach duine sa seomra agus domsa.<br/><br/>Roghnaigh muiníneach, mic léinn atá ag dul amach do chuid mac léinn scriptithe (má sheolaim aon cheann roimh ré). Le linn mo chuairteanna scoile ar an láthair, déanaim iarracht cuid de na mic léinn nach bhfuil chomh muiníneach céanna a tharraingt amach, ach fuair mé amach nach n-oibríonn sé seo chomh maith le linn cuairteanna fíorúla mar ní féidir liom iad a chloisteáil.<br/><br/>An bhfuil mic léinn le labhairt páirteanna suí suas chun tosaigh.

| News Archive<br/><br/>New book looks at ways in which to tackle HIV-challenges<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis with Marjorie Human who designed the cover of the book, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>The HIV pandemic has brought out the best and worst in humans in terms of response. On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Nuacht Cartlann<br/><br/>Féachann leabhar nua ar bhealaí inar féidir dul i ngleic le dúshláin VEID<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>An tOllamh Dennis Francis le Marie Human a dhear clúdach an leabhair, Ag gníomhú ar VEID.<br/><br/>Is é an paindéim VEID an ceann is fearr agus is measa i dtéarmaí freagartha.Ar thaobh amháin, spreag sé stiogma agus foréigean agus ar an taobh eile thug sé freagraí cuiditheacha agus tacúil ó dhaoine aonair agus grúpaí éagsúla. Tá leabhar nua, Ag gníomhú ar VEID, curtha in eagar ag an Ollamh Dennis Francis, Déan na Dámh an Oideachais in Ollscoil an tSaorstáit, ag féachaint ar an gcaoi ar féidir an drámaíocht a úsáid chun athrú sóisialta ríthábhachtach a chur chun cinn chomh maith le hathrú iompraíochta aonair.<br/><br/>Trí ghníomhú ar VEID, tugtar fiosrú córasach isteach sa drámaíocht mar chur chuige chun VEID/SEIF agus dearcthaí agus iompraíochtaí gaolmhara a phlé. Is téacs léannta é an leabhar agus cuimsíonn sé obair thart ar fiche údar cruthaitheach. Áirítear leis na húdair don leabhar, i measc nithe eile, an tOllamh Coll Barnes (Ollscoil an Wittersrand), Rob Patman (Ollscoil Stellenbosch) agus Yvonne Slip ó Ollscoil KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>Thosaigh an tionscadal seo i 2009 agus tá go leor de mo chuid ama tógtha le chéile chun obair na n-údar cruthaitheach go heisceachtúil a thabhairt le chéile. Tá an taighde a chuirtear in iúl tríd an leabhar bunaidh agus tráthúil agus cuireann sé go mór le comhráite faoi ról/s agus tábhacht an dráma chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar shaincheisteanna VEID agus SEIF," a deir an tOllamh Francis Francis |

The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Tras-scríbhinn de Thástáil É Gaibhse ar an gCruabra Gorm, Callinectis Sapidus, i mBarnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 Meán Fómhair 2008<br/><br/>Roghnaigh mé úsáid a bhaint as an portán Gorm, Callinectus sapidus, do mo turgnamh toisc go bhfuil sé flúirseach anseo i mBeangart Bay agus tá sé réasúnta éasca a ghabháil.<br/><br/>Is portán snámha é an sapidus atá tábhachtach do chabáin bog-sliog tráchtála, idir thráchtála agus áineasa (Jivoff 2008) Is é príomh-mhodh cabhradh an chábáin ná gaiste portáin bhunúsach<br/><br/>Tarlaíonn gaistí Ghost nuair a chailltear gaiste fós chun orgánaigh a ghabháil (Breen 1990) John Wonnk a deir go bhfuil go héasca 2,000 i Barnegat BaySince C.

A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Focal Eastáit Réadaigh an Lae: Rogha<br/><br/>Rogha: Comhaontú le coinneáil ar oscailt, ar feadh tréimhse socraithe, tairiscint chun fíor- mhaoin a dhíol nó a léasú.

| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Buntáistí a bhaineann le Caratenoids don Craiceann<br/><br/>Ar chuala tú faoi carotenoids?Is iad na fíteashláintíochta cumhachtacha seo na comhábhair lí a fhaightear i bplandaí a thugann bláthanna, torthaí, agus a fhágann a dathanna buí, oráiste agus dearg.<br/><br/>Ó na 1930idí, tá thart ar 800 carotenoids sainaitheanta ag eolaithe agus tá thart ar 40 le fáil i gcorp an duine, lena n-áirítear an ciseal is forimeallaí den eipideirm, an deirm agus saill subcutaneous. Is iad na carotenoids is coitianta béite-carotene, alfa-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopen, agus astacanthin.Is féidir leat níos mó a léamh faoi astacanthin anseo.<br/><br/>Tá tionchar ag go leor fachtóirí ar ábhar na gcaotóin sa chraiceann, lena n-áirítear torthaí agus glasraí a iontógtha, a n-in-infhaighteacht ó bhianna éagsúla, a fhorlíonadh, a nochtadh do radaíocht UV, truailliú aeir, tomhaltas alcóil, caitheamh tobac agus strus.<br/><br/>Cén chaoi a gcuidíonn Caeronoids le mo chraiceann?<br/><br/>Tá Cartenoids ar chuid de na frithocsaídeoirí is cáiliúla don chraiceann agus tá feidhmeanna tábhachtacha acu freisin mar ghníomhairí frith-athlastach.<br/><br/>Sláintiúil Aosú agus Deisiúchán Craiceann<br/><br/>Tá frithocsaídeoirí riachtanach don chraiceann sláintiúil toisc go gcuidíonn siad le damáiste radacach saor in aisce a chosc ar chealla. Is frithocsaídeoirí tábhachtacha de chuid Cartenoids, chomh maith le vitimín E, vitimín C, agus Co einsím Q10.<br/><br/>Mar gheall ar a ngníomhaíocht antioxidant, soláthraíonn agus a spreagadh collagen agus elastin a tháirgeadh sa chraiceann.Cuidíonn sé seo chun cur le dlús an craiceann, tiús, leaisteachas, agus firmness. Laghdaíonn collagen agus elastin mar a théann muid in aois, mar sin tá sé ríthábhachtach go leor carotenoids a fháil sa réim bia agus go sainiúil d’aosú go maith.<br/><br/>Is féidir le Cartenoids feabhas a chur ar chomharthaí grianghrafadóireachta, discoloration craicinn, leaisteachas, hydration, uigeacht, agus is féidir caillteanas uisce trasdeidearálú a laghdú.<br/><br/>Spreagann Astacanthin go háirithe fibroids chun collagen agus elastin a tháirgeadh, cuireann sé bac ar ghníomhaíocht na n-einsí a dhéanann collagen agus elastin a bhriseadh síos, agus taispeánann sé éifeachtaí frith-athlastacha agus scagtha UV.
