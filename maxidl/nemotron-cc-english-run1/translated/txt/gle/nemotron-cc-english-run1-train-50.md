| Concussion: Using Cooling Helmets to Combat Brain Injuries in College Football<br/><br/>Former football player Kevin Jackson uses brain cooling technology in the hopes of reducing the effects of traumatic brain injuries and sports-related concussions.<br/>Jackson was a running back for the University of Illinois from 1990-1994. In addition to suffering a number of injuries to his body during his playing days, Jackson also suffered a number of un-diagnosed concussions. Now a research scientist and injury spotter, Jackson uses his experience as a player to help him understand and combat brain trauma in sports.<br/>This video illustrates the chain of events that occur when a traumatic brain injury happens, explores how concussion symptoms very from person to person, highlights the need to protect oneself from repeated head traumas, and shows how using cooling technologies might aide in recovery from injury.<br/>To learn more about this research, please visit...<br/> | Ag baint úsáide as clogaid Fuarú chun Chomhrac Díobhálacha Brain i Peile an Choláiste<br/><br/>Iar-imreoir peile Kevin Jackson Úsáideann teicneolaíocht fuaraithe inchinn i súil go laghdófar éifeachtaí díobhálacha inchinne trámach agus conclúidí a bhaineann le spóirt.<br/>Bhí Jackson ar ais d’Ollscoil Illinois ó 1990-1994 Chomh maith le roinnt gortuithe a fhulaingt dá chorp le linn a lá imeartha, d’fhulaing Jackson roinnt conclúidí neamh-dhiagnóiseacha freisin.

| Massage Therapy<br/><br/>Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples – including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians – were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.<br/><br/>Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person's muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their wellbeing or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.<br/><br/>The term 'massage therapy' is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure and the intensity of the treatment is applied.<br/><br/>Massage for treatment of some disorders<br/><br/>Research indicates that massage and myotherapy are effective in managing:<br/><br/>subacute/chronic low back pain<br/><br/>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)<br/><br/>anxiety<br/><br/>stress<br/><br/>soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>high blood pressure<br/><br/>insomnia.<br/><br/>They can also be effectively used to support people with:<br/><br/>a chronic disease<br/><br/>a life threatening illness such as cancer.<br/><br/>Benefits of massage<br/><br/>One of the immediate benefits of massage is a feeling of deep relaxation and calm. This occurs because massage prompts the release of endorphins – the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that produce feelings of wellbeing.<br/><br/>Levels of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, cortisol and norepinephrine, are also reduced. Studies indicate that high levels of stress hormones impair the immune system.<br/><br/>Some of the physical benefits of massage and myotherapy include:<br/><br/>reduced muscle tension<br/><br/>improved circulation<br/><br/>stimulation of the lymphatic system<br/><br/>reduction of stress hormones<br/><br/>relaxation<br/><br/>increased joint mobility and flexibility<br/><br/>improved skin tone<br/><br/>improved recovery of soft tissue injuries<br/><br/>heightened mental alertness<br/><br/>reduced anxiety and depression | Teiripe Massage<br/><br/>B’fhéidir go bhfuil Massage ar cheann de na traidisiúin leighis is sine.Bhí go leor pobail ársa – na Gréagaigh Ársa, na hÉigipte, na Síne agus na hIndiaigh san áireamh – cinnte go raibh airíonna teiripeacha suathaireachta ann agus bhain siad úsáid as chun déileáil le héagsúlacht tinneas.<br/><br/>Is éard is teiripe suathaireachta ann ná an cleachtas chun matáin duine agus fíochán bog a ghlúine nó a ionramháil chun feabhas a chur ar a bhfolláine nó ar a sláinte.

| Mistakes happen and it can be a long road to recovery when it comes to rebuilding credit.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart trick is useful for people who have:<br/><br/>1. Declared bankruptcy in the past and is trying to recover 2. Defaulted on payments in the past 3. A lot of credit inquiries and doesn't want to add more inquiries 4. Made late payments in the past and had their accounts closed because of this 5. Someone who doesn't have a credit score at all<br/><br/>The caveat is If they ask you to enter your whole social security number, and not just the last 4, then it will most likely be a hard inquiry. With anything mentioned in this post, your mileage may vary, so it may work for some people and not for others.<br/><br/>If you use this method and have defaulted on payments in the past, be sure to pay off your bills every month.<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick<br/><br/>The Shopping Cart Trick is visiting a website and waiting for a credit card offer to pop up when you check out. You do not need to purchase anything, it will appear before the payment page. This method only works for certain stores.<br/><br/>A few examples are Express, Overstock.com, and Williams-Sonoma. There are a few Synchrony cards like Walmart and QVC that work as well. Full list of stores can be found at the end of this post.<br/><br/>When you go through the process, be sure to have the ad blocker turned off and enter your real address. If the store can't match the last 4 digits of your SSN with your address, then the soft pull won't work. Again, you might have to go through the shopping process a few times before you receive an offer. You don't have to buy anything.<br/><br/>The credit limits might be lower for some people, but the idea is to rebuild your credit. If you do choose to go through this process, I recommend picking stores you will actually shop. It doesn't make sense to get a bonus or points at a store you don't shop at. Most, if not all of the cards, don't have annual fees, so they are good as foundation cards.<br/><br/>For me, this trick doesn't work out well because I don't frequent the listed shops often | Tarlaíonn botúin agus d'fhéadfadh sé a bheith ina bhóthar fada a ghnóthú nuair a thagann sé chun creidmheas a atógáil.<br/><br/>Tá an cleas cart Siopadóireachta úsáideach do dhaoine a bhfuil:<br/><br/>1.Dearbhaithe féimheacht san am atá caite agus tá sé ag iarraidh 2.

| Composition in Design – 15 Things You Can't Afford NOT to Know<br/><br/>Composition is one of the six crucial elements of design. Without strong and solid design composition, everything starts falling apart.<br/><br/>In this article we will give you 15 tips on how to strengthen your composition – no matter if it's a photography, illustration or any graphic design project.<br/><br/>We also prepared a beautiful collection of designs in the end, for your inspirarion. Enjoy!<br/><br/>1 . Direct the eye with leading lines<br/><br/>Usually, when you look at any visual, your eye falls first on particular object. In this case, this is the car and it is the focal point of the poster. We will talk a little bit more in our second point of the article. But if your eyes are immidiatelt attracted to certain part of visual, where do you look next? That is a tough question to start with, but a simple answer would be – you look where your eyes lead you. And your eyes lead you, where the designer uses leading lines to direct you through the layout. In this case, a leading line is the road. It also nicely frames the text on the left side and leads your eye back to the focal point of the poster.<br/><br/>Often lines can be more obvious then here, directly using arrows, flowcharts and are very useful method for explaining information and sequences.<br/><br/>2. Create focus in your design composition<br/><br/>A key element to design composition is having a strong focal point. No matter how many elements you have in your design, you have to stress and show the viewer, which is the most important part of your piece. In this case, the artist used color, contrast and scale to organize the space and create focal point. Keep in mind that the most important role of design is to communicate. Therefore, your focal point would be also your most important statement and message to your audience!<br/><br/>3. Use hierachy<br/><br/>Once that you've created your focal point, you have to figure out what to do with the rest of the elements of your design composition. Of course, you have structure these elements as well, and set a priority to them. In this example, the focal point is the man in the picture. Then, we have to look for a name of the event, what is the whole thing about. Only after that, we can keep looking for additional info, such as subheadings, dates, numbers, etc.<br/><br/>All this organization of the information with the help of size, color, weight is called hierachy.<br/><br/>4. Use complementing elements<br/><br/>Always seek to create unifed look throughout your entire design. It is not a good idea to mix and match images from different sources, with no simillarities in style between them. This will only tire the eyes of the viewer and confuse him/her.<br/><br/>This website design is a great example of cohesiveness between the images – they all have simple, one color background and the object are placed in the center. Of course, your design solution would depend on the specific project need.<br/><br/>In this case, you want the viewer to recognize and focus easily on the item to be bought, without any other distraction. The overal feel of the top image and color scheme is also repeated in the backgrounds of the products, so this is one more nice connection between the different parts of the design!<br/><br/>5. Repeat elements<br/><br/>Often your projects will consist of more than one page. If you repeat specific elements from one section of your design to another, you will help the viewer to orientate himself/ herself easier across the design.<br/><br/>Repeating elements are often used to create a certain theme as well and again, help the designcomposition to "stick together".<br/><br/>Some of the repeating elements you could use are: graphic motifs, type, cetrain layout reused in the different pages/parts of your project.<br/><br/>6. Balance elements<br/><br/>There are two types of balance in design composition – symmetrical and asymmetrical. The first uses similar elements, mirrored (distributed equally) on the both sides of an axis (visible or non-visible line). Symmetrical balance is very clean and elegant, but sometimes it can get a bit boring, so then, designers prefer asymmetrical balance instead. Obviously, in this scenario we won't have equal in size elements, placed in similar way.<br/><br/>Here, we look at the different sizes of the elements, the textures and so on. It helps to think of a design elements, as they have "weight". Larger elements would be "heavier". For example, if you have a big, "heavy", vertically pointing pumpkin, you can "balance" it out by using several horizontal lines and smaller objects on the opposite side of the "heavy" object.<br/><br/>7. Align elements<br/><br/>Alignment is another important tool to use in design composition and organize your elements. It often comes handy wen you have a lot of types, colors, images, headings and subheadings. There are many tools on the web, which can help you to snap and align elements to each other, leaving no room for floating pieces and messy design. Alignment brings an elegant vibe to a design. Even the most asymetric designs have some sorts of alignment and structuring of similar blocks of content.<br/><br/>It is a general rule, that when you have a long blocks of texts, left alignment would help the eye to scan more easily teh content. This poster is great visualization of this concept.<br/><br/>8. Use contrast<br/><br/>Contrast is used for drawing attention. If you boost the contrast of an element, this will make it pop. On the contrary, using elements with lower contrast will make them fade and "disappear".<br/><br/>Here, the contrast underlines the strong, geometic, bold architectural forms and the play of light and shadow. Not on last place, the small figure might be with lower contrast, compared to other elements, but it is still visible and nicely balances out the big, dark shape at the opposite, top left corner.<br/><br/>9. Use white space<br/><br/>White space is unreplacable tool in bringing clarity into your design composition. White space is not an "empty space", but necessary element, allowing your design to breathe. It also helps emphasizing the subject of interest.<br/><br/>For example, in this photo, all the white space (unoccupied by other elements) helps to focus all the attention on the woman figure and her posture. Do you think you would pay attention to this woman, if the image was filled in with many other elements? To help you understand the importance of white space, thinks of your own room. How would you feel if you have only one small passage from the door to the bed and everything is piled up with objects? How would you feel, if your bed doesn't not fill the whole room and there are no objects all around the place. Yes, you get the ideas – we all need space, even the design does.<br/><br/>10. Understand and use type of layouts<br/><br/>The first one we are going to look at is the so called, big photo or single visual layout which was was very popular for web designers in the recent years. It gives elegant, clean look, usually highlights a product or service with the help of single high-quality, engaging photo. This type of layout gives a sense of space. As you can suggest, it is not commonly used for news sites, where there is a lot of information to be presented. Here key phrase is quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Key elements to this type of layout are white space and simple typo.<br/><br/>Another type of layout is the Z layout. This is where the eye of the viewer is lead from one element of the design to other.<br/><br/>In this example we naturally first look at the photo, than our eyes are drawn to the text on the right side of the visual and then we continue scanning down, jumping from visual to text. Z layouts create rhythm and are often used on website with lot of information, where you have to orientate the user and "guide" him.<br/><br/>Another way to keep things nice, neat and organized is to use the so called golden ratio or rule of thirds. You can read more about in our article for taking amazing photos, where the same principle applies to photography. In short, dividing your layout into thirds – both vertically and horizontally and placing most important elements where these lines cross, will make your design more visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The example here is MailChimp's website. Notice how the monkey character is slightly to the left? It simply looks good! Oh, and one more thing – when you move a character across space, move it from left to right.<br/><br/>11. Create movement<br/><br/>Movement is change of place or position, an effort. It can be actual motion or it can be implied — arranging parts of the image so that the viewer gets a sense of motion by using lines, shapes, forms, textures, etc.<br/><br/>Since ancient times our eyes are more attracted to moving objects than still ones, and this was important for one's survival – in hunting and protecting yourself from animals. That is why, people are very attracted to images that depict movement and respectively, a composition with nice "flow" of elements is more intriguing.<br/><br/>12. People like triangles<br/><br/>The shape of triangle creates interest, sets a direction and creates movement. Surely, it is a very strong shape and designers and artists use it to organize their layout as well, and not only as visual element. In the recent years, it became hugely popular with the polygon design.<br/><br/>13. Simplification<br/><br/>Simplification is the technique of reducing a composition to only the most essential elements that support the visual statement.<br/><br/>If every part is equally important, then every part is equally unimportant. Nathan Fowkes<br/><br/>It is natural for the eyes to look at details, but it is very hard to see the design as whole and how all elements work together. When in doubt, better remove elements from your design composition, rather adding and trying to find a place for them. We know it's a cliche – but it is still legit "Less is more"!<br/><br/>14. See where your elements are in relation to edges<br/><br/>Often, you will see designers using blank space around the edges of the layout, giving the design room to breathe. Again it is natural to the eye to see elements receeding around edges and fading out. If it is busy around the edges in your design – the overal feel would be of something heavy, big and it will take away from the attention of central elements.<br/><br/>In this case, the designer used large, abstract shape to underline the typo – yeard and names. Because the shape is directing the eye, varied in thickness and has sense of movement to it, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer, but on the contrary – offers him/her aesthetic pleasure and simplicity.<br/><br/>15. Mind the transitions<br/><br/>Transition in design composition is a little bit harder to define. We discussed repetition already, in comparison, transition handles the natural flow from one shape to another, leading the eye from one spot to another. Often, designers use curved lines and shapes to smoothen transition from more angular shapes and blocks of content. Transition helps to relax the eye and "soften" the design.<br/><br/>Looking for some inspiration?<br/><br/>Now that you learnt something about the most important ingredients of good design composition, we made a small gallery with design compositions we find inspiring.

Tá cothromaíocht siméadrach an-ghlan agus galánta, ach uaireanta is féidir leis beagán leadránach a fháil, mar sin ansin, is fearr le dearthóirí cothromaíocht neamhshiméadrach ina ionad.Ar ndóigh, sa chás seo ní bheidh comhionann againn i ngnéithe méide, curtha ar an mbealach céanna.<br/><br/>Anseo, breathnaímid ar mhéideanna éagsúla na n-eilimintí, na uigeachtaí agus mar sin de.Cuidíonn sé le smaoineamh ar eilimintí dearaidh, mar tá siad "meáchan". Bheadh eilimintí níos mó "níos troime". Mar shampla, má tá tú pumpkin mór, "trom", go hingearach pointe, is féidir leat é a "iarmhéid" amach trí úsáid a bhaint roinnt línte cothrománacha agus rudaí níos lú ar an taobh eile den "trom".<br/><br/>7. Eilimintí ailíniú<br/><br/>Is uirlis thábhachtach eile é ailíniú a úsáid i gcomhdhéanamh dearaidh agus d’eilimintí a eagrú.Is minic go mbíonn go leor cineálacha, dathanna, íomhánna, ceannteidil agus fo-cheannteidil agat. Tá go leor uirlisí ar an ngréasán, ar féidir leo cabhrú leat eilimintí a snapáil agus a ailíniú lena chéile, gan aon seomra a fhágáil le haghaidh píosaí ar snámh agus dearadh messy. Tá fiú na dearaí is neamhshiméadracha ar roinnt cineálacha ailíniú agus struchtúrú bloic ábhar den chineál céanna.<br/><br/>Is riail ghinearálta é, nuair a bhíonn bloic fhada téacsanna agat, cuideodh ailíniú ar chlé leis an tsúil chun ábhar the a scanadh níos éasca.Is é seo póstaer iontach an choincheapa seo.<br/><br/>8. Úsáid codarsnacht<br/><br/>Úsáidtear codarsnachta le haghaidh aird a tharraingt.Má threisíonn tú codarsnacht eilimint, déanfaidh sé seo pop.Ar a mhalairt, má úsáideann tú gnéithe le codarsnacht níos ísle déanfaidh siad céimnithe iad agus "díspeagadh".<br/><br/>Anseo, cuireann an chodarsnacht béim ar na foirmeacha láidre, geoiméadracha, trom ailtireachta agus ar an dráma solais agus scáth. Ní ar an áit dheireanach, d’fhéadfadh an figiúr beag a bheith le codarsnacht níos ísle, i gcomparáid le heilimintí eile, ach tá sé fós le feiceáil agus go deas iarmhéid amach an cruth mór, dorcha ag a mhalairt, an chúinne ar chlé barr.<br/><br/>9. Bain úsáid as spás bán<br/><br/>Tá an spás Bán uirlis unreplaceable a thabhairt soiléireacht i do chomhdhéanamh dearadh.Ní spás bán "spás folamh", ach eilimint riachtanach, ag ligean do dhearadh a breathe.Cuidíonn sé freisin béim ar an ábhar spéise.<br/><br/>Mar shampla, sa ghrianghraf seo, cuidíonn an spás bán go léir (gan áitiú ag eilimintí eile) leis an aire go léir a dhíriú ar fhigiúr na mná agus ar a staidiúir. An gceapann tú go n-íocfaidh tú aird ar an mbean seo, dá líonfaí an íomhá isteach le go leor eilimintí eile? Chun cabhrú leat tuiscint a fháil ar an tábhacht a bhaineann le spás bán, smaoinigh ar do sheomra féin.Conas a bhraitheann tú mura bhfuil ach sliocht beag amháin agat ón doras go dtí an leaba agus go bhfuil gach rud líonta suas le rudaí? Conas a bhraitheann tú, mura líonann do leaba an seomra ar fad agus nach bhfuil aon rudaí ar fud na háite., A gheobhaidh tú na smaointe – ní mór dúinn go léir spás, fiú an dearadh a dhéanann.<br/><br/>10. Na cineálacha leagan amach a thuiscint agus a úsáid<br/><br/>Is é an chéad cheann a bhfuilimid chun breathnú air ná an leagan amach ar a dtugtar, grianghraf mór nó amhairc aonair, a raibh an-tóir air do dhearthóirí gréasáin le blianta beaga anuas. Tugann sé cuma galánta, glan, tarraingíonn sé aird de ghnáth ar tháirge nó ar sheirbhís le cabhair ó aon ard-chaighdeán, grianghraf tarraingteach.Tugann an cineál leagan amach seo mothú spáis. Mar is féidir leat a mholadh, ní úsáidtear é go coitianta le haghaidh láithreáin nuachta, áit a bhfuil go leor faisnéise le cur i láthair.Seo eochairfhrása cáilíochta thar chainníocht.<br/><br/>Is iad príomhghnéithe an chineáil leagan amach seo ná spás bán agus an cineál simplí.<br/><br/>Is leagan amach eile é an leagan amach Z.Is é seo an áit a bhfuil súile an lucht féachana mar thoradh ar ghné amháin den dearadh go ceann eile.<br/><br/>Sa sampla seo táimid ag breathnú go nádúrtha ar an ngrianghraf, ná tarraingítear ár súile chuig an téacs ar thaobh na láimhe deise den fhís agus ansin leanann muid ag scanadh, ag léim ó théacs amhairc go téacs. Cruthaíonn leagan amach Z rithim agus is minic a úsáidtear iad ar an suíomh Gréasáin le go leor faisnéise, áit a gcaithfidh tú an t-úsáideoir a dhíriú agus é a “threoir”.<br/><br/>Bealach eile chun rudaí a choinneáil deas, néata agus eagraithe is ea an cóimheas órga nó an riail atá againn a úsáid.Is féidir leat níos mó a léamh faoinár n-alt chun grianghraif iontacha a thógáil, áit a mbaineann an prionsabal céanna le grianghrafadóireacht. I mbeagán focal, do leagan amach a roinnt i dtríúanna – go hingearach agus go cothrománach agus na gnéithe is tábhachtaí a chur i gcás na línte seo a thrasnú, a dhéanamh do dhearadh níos taitneamhaí.<br/><br/>Is é an sampla anseo ná suíomh Gréasáin MailChimp.Tabhair faoi deara conas atá an carachtar moncaí beagán ar chlé? Breathnaíonn sé go maith! Ó, agus rud amháin eile - nuair a bhogann tú carachtar ar fud an spáis, bog é ó chlé go deas.<br/><br/>11. Cruthaigh gluaiseacht<br/><br/>Is éard atá i gceist le gluaiseacht ná athrú áite nó suímh, iarracht.Is féidir é a bheith ina tairiscint iarbhír nó is féidir é a chur i bhfeidhm – codanna den íomhá a shocrú ionas go bhfaighidh an lucht féachana tuiscint ar thairiscint trí línte, cruthanna, foirmeacha, uigeachtaí a úsáid, etc.<br/><br/>Ó am ársa go bhfuil ár súile níos meallta chun rudaí a bhogadh ná cinn fós, agus bhí sé seo tábhachtach do mharthanas - maidir le fiach agus tú féin a chosaint ó ainmhithe. Sin é an fáth, mealltar daoine go mór le híomhánna a léiríonn gluaiseacht agus faoi seach, tá comhdhéanamh le "sreabhadh deas" eilimintí níos suimiúla.<br/><br/>12. Daoine cosúil le triantáin<br/><br/>Cruthaíonn an cruth ar triantáin spéis, socraíonn sé treo agus cruthaíonn sé gluaiseacht. Surely, is cruth an-láidir é agus úsáideann dearthóirí agus ealaíontóirí é chun a leagan amach a eagrú freisin, agus ní hamháin mar eilimint amhairc. Le blianta beaga anuas, bhí sé an-tóir ag an dearadh polagán.<br/><br/>13. Simpliú<br/><br/>Is é simpliú an teicníc chun comhdhéanamh a laghdú seachas na heilimintí is riachtanaí a thacaíonn leis an ráiteas amhairc.<br/><br/>Má tá gach cuid chomh tábhachtach céanna, tá gach cuid chomh tábhachtach céanna. Nathan Fowes<br/><br/>Tá sé nádúrtha go bhfeicfidh na súile mionsonraí, ach tá sé an-deacair an dearadh a fheiceáil ina iomláine agus conas a oibríonn na heilimintí go léir le chéile.Nuair a bhíonn amhras ort, bain eilimintí níos fearr ó do chomhdhéanamh dearaidh, in áit a chur leis agus ag iarraidh áit a fháil dóibh. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil sé ina chlice – ach tá sé fós legit "Less níos mó"!<br/><br/>14. Féach cá bhfuil do chuid eilimintí i ndáil le himill<br/><br/>Go minic, feicfidh tú dearthóirí ag baint úsáide as spás bán ar fud an imill an leagan amach, ag tabhairt an seomra dearaidh a breathe.Ain tá sé nádúrtha don tsúil eilimintí atá ag dul timpeall imill a fheiceáil agus fading amach. Má tá sé gnóthach ar fud na himill i do dhearadh – bheadh an mothú foriomlán rud éigin trom, mór agus tógfaidh sé amach ó aird na n-eilimintí lárnacha.<br/><br/>Sa chás seo, d'úsáid an dearthóir cruth mór, teibí chun béim a leagan ar an gcineál - bliain agus ainmneacha. Toisc go bhfuil an cruth ag stiúradh na súl, éagsúil i tiús agus tá tuiscint ar ghluaiseacht air, ní sháraíonn sé an lucht féachana, ach ar a mhalairt – tugann sé pléisiúr agus simplíocht aeistéitiúil dó.<br/><br/>15. Aire a thabhairt don aistriú<br/><br/>Tá an t-aistriú i gcomhdhéanamh dearadh rud beag níos deacra a shainiú. Phléamar aird cheana féin, i gcomparáid, láimhseálann an t-aistriú an sreabhadh nádúrtha ó chruth amháin go cruth eile, rud a fhágann go bhfuil an tsúil ó áit amháin go háit eile. Go minic, úsáideann dearthóirí línte cuartha agus cruthanna chun aistriú ó cruthanna agus bloic ábhar a mhaolú.Cuidíonn an t-aistriú leis an tsúil a scíth a ligean agus "goid" an dearadh.<br/><br/>Ag féachaint do roinnt inspioráid?<br/><br/>Anois go bhfoghlaimíonn tú rud éigin faoi na comhábhair is tábhachtaí de chomhdhéanamh dearadh maith, rinne muid gailearaí beag le comhdhéanamh dearadh a spreagaimid.

| Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ nave and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a nave T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs.<br/><br/>Public Health Relevance<br/><br/>The studies proposed herein will determine, using mass spectrometry, the signal transduction events that take place in memory CD8+ T cells upon restimulation, relative to nave CD8+ T cells. Given that these cells play an essential role in protection from secondary infection, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these cells exert their effector function for the protection of human health. | Is cealla riachtanacha den chóras imdhíonachta iad cealla CD8+ T, coinníodh ionfhabhtú sa phost chun cosaint a dhéanamh ar ionsamhlaíocht imdhíonachta ina dhiaidh sin. Tá cur síos déanta ar go leor rialtóirí tras-thrascríobh agus roinnt cásanna chomharthaíochta thartaí a bhaineann le cealla T naive agus cuimhne araon agus tá siad curtha in iúl go mór an próiseas trína gcruthaítear cuimhne imdhíoneolaíochta. In ainneoin na ndifríochtaí soiléire san tras-scríobh, níl an difríocht idir na cealla CD8+ agus cuimhne anaithnid go hiomlán agus dá bhrí sin léiríonn sé bearna suntasach inár mbonn eolais. Príomhimeacht comharthaíochta amháin a tharlaíonn mar fhreagra ar spreagadh TCR is ea gníomhachtú na n-ian a chuireann iarmhar tyrosine fosfáit ar próitéiní comharthaíochta srutha. Dá bhrí sin, i gcomparáid leis na líonraí comharthaí fosfáití atá idir cealla dúchais agus cuimhne Sainaithneoidh cealla T spriocanna chun freagairt imdhíonachta cille CD8+ a mhodhnú chun tionchar dearfach a imirt ar fhreagairt ar ghalar agus ar éifeachtúlacht vacsaíní. Is é cuspóir an togra ar leith seo na conairí chomharthaíochta in-cellular atá uathúil chun cuimhne CD8+ cealla T a mhaolú.Is é ár hipitéis lárnach ná go rialaíonn conairí idirbhirt comhartha ar leith an chuimhne CD8+ T freagra cille. Is é an réasúnaíocht agus an t-áitreabh eolaíoch don obair atá beartaithe ná go gcumasóidh tuiscint ar leibhéal domhanda poitéimeach na hathruithe a tharlaíonn i gcealla T de réir mar a dhéanann siad idirdhealú ó naive go cealla T cuimhne níos éifeachtúla agus dearadh cóireála drugaí chun galair agus ionfhabhtú a chomhrac. Déanfaimid tástáil ar ár hipitéis lárnach leis na haidhmeanna sonracha seo a leanas: 1) Socraigh na hathruithe ar an tarchur comhartha TCR a tharlaíonn i cealla CD8+ na heaglaise agus cuimhne T. Chun líonraí comharthaíochta kinase a phróifíliú, bainfimid úsáid as mais-speictream cainníochtúil an-íogair a d’fhorbraíomar ar chealla na dúna, na héifeachtaí agus na cuimhne CD8+ T. Bunaithe ar scáileán réamhbhreithe, d'aithníomar go bhfuil Jack2 hyperfosfáití, ag tabhairt le fios gur idirghabhálaí tábhachtach é an freagra cuimhne.Déanfaimid tástáil ar an hipitéis go bhfuil Jak2 hipirghníomhaíocht ríthábhachtach le haghaidh freagairtí cuimhne. I dteannta a chéile, sainaithneoidh comhlánú Aim1 líonraí comharthaíochta úrscéalta a chuidíonn le freagairtí cuimhne CD8+ agus 2) Saineolas a thabhairt ar an bpróitéin ceangailteach CREB (CBT) mar athrú móilíneach a rialaíonn líonraí trascríobh i gcealla cuimhne CD8+ T. Mar gheall ar ár bpríomhshonraí inar nochtadh againn bealaí comharthaíochta uathúla a bhaineann le foirm chealla CD8+, is dóigh linn go dtaispeánann muid i gcealla cuimhne CD8+ T, cuirimid cosc ar chur ar chur i bhfeidhm beochan méadaithe ar CBI chun tírdhreach tras-scríofa uathúil a chur chun cinn i gcoinne na cille T. Aithneoidh muid an chaoi a ndéanann fealsúnacht an CBI rialú ar fhachtóirí trascríobh mar CRB agus MYB. Ina theannta sin, déanfaimid cur chuige géiniteach chun a chinneadh conas a fheidhmíonn CBP i bhfoirmiú cealla cuimhne CD8+ agus CD8+ freagraí cuimhne cuimhne. Le chéile, cuirfidh na sonraí a fhaightear san am2 meicníocht úrscéal a mhíníonn conas a spreagann athruithe i ngníomhaíocht kinase tyróisín a bhaineann le Clár tras-thrascríobh uathúil tiomána cuimhne cealla CD8+ T.<br/><br/>Ábharthacht don tSláinte Phoiblí<br/><br/>Cinnfidh na staidéir atá beartaithe anseo, ag baint úsáide as oll-speictriméatáit, na himeachtaí greamaithe comharthaí a bhíonn ar siúl i gcealla cuimhne CD8+ T ar athshamhlaithe, i gcoibhneas le cealla CD8+ T na heaglaise. Ós rud é go bhfuil ról riachtanach ag na cealla seo maidir le cosaint ó ionfhabhtú tánaisteach, tá sé ríthábhachtach go dtuigimid na meicníochtaí móilíneacha trína ndéanann na cealla seo a bhfeidhm mar éifeacht do shláinte an duine a chosaint. |
