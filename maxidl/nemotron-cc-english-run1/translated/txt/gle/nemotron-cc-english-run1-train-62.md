| Abstract<br/><br/>There are an estimated 3.5 million mosques worldwide. The relatively large surface area of most mosque rooftops and their ubiquity in the Muslim world make them excellent candidates for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Muslims congregate for prayers at mosques five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because these times are governed by the sun, they change chronographically within the year, according to the season, but are perpetual. As such, mosque electricity load profiles are highly predictable across each year and experience limited annual variation.<br/><br/>Authors<br/><br/>Amro Elshurafa<br/><br/>Research FellowAmro is a research fellow with 15 years of research experience on three continents in the fields of technology and energy.

| Why are Explosion Proof Lights Different?<br/>(4/22/2010) When the conditions are right in any of these settings, the only thing keeping the unthinkable from happening is the lack of an ignition source. In an atmosphere that has become contaminated with volatile gases, or heavily saturated with combustible dust, all it takes is one tiny spark to set in motion a chain of reactions that can lead to fires, explosions, and injuries.<br/><br/>In many of these settings, it is in fact common for a flammable atmosphere to be present, and there is no practical way to completely avoid producing these conditions. Because these conditions are often created as a part of the normal operations of industry and cannot be totally negated, the next obvious solution is to remove all possible sources of ignition. Doing this is easier said than done, since in industry there are so many sources that must be considered. Everything from light switches to fans are possible sources of ignition, and they simply cannot be entirely removed the workspace. It's because of this that specialized versions of equipment that must be operated in these hazardous environments have been developed and are mandated for use in hazardous locations by OSHA.<br/><br/>Equipment for use in hazardous locations has several ratings and categories that indicate the suitability of the equipment for use depending upon the level of danger a particular location may create. For the control of ignition sources, most regulations deal in mandating either intrinsically safe electrical equipment, or explosion proof equipment. The differences between the two are subtle, but important. Intrinsically safe equipment is basically any equipment that is incapable of producing sufficient energy to cause ignition. Explosion proof refers to equipment that can contain and isolate possible sources of ignition, preventing them from making contact with the open air. It would seem obvious that intrinsically safe would be the highest safety rating, and in fact it is. Intrinsically safe rated equipment is suitable for use in all the hazardous location groups and ratings as defined by OSHA regulations. Despite this, intrinsically safe equipment is not always the best choice because of the limitations created by its higher costs and generally low power characteristics.<br/><br/>Explosion proof equipment on the other hand is not as constrained by the limitations imposed by the intrinsically safe rating, and allows for a broader and more powerful spectrum of equipment to be used, and at cheaper cost. Since the explosion proof rating only requires that sources of ignition be contained, and temperatures be kept below certain levels for varying division ratings, the basic design of equipment can remain intact, with additional design incorporated to contain its normally open sources of possible ignition. A basic example would be a simple light switch. In normal conditions, a light switch has at its core a contact point where two metal conductors are put into contact with each other to form a closed circuit, thereby transferring electrical energy to the lamp.<br/><br/>It is at this contact point that a possible ignition source is created as the two conductors come into contact with each other and produce a small spark or arc. Isolating this spark can be as simple as encasing the entire switch within a sealed and non conductive exterior such as rubber, thereby removing the conductive portion of the switch from contact with the outside atmosphere.This is a greatly simplified example, but it demonstrates the basic premise. To better understand the full premise behind making electrical equipment explosion proof, and just how much is involved in the design, it is better to look at something a bit more complicated.<br/><br/>One of the first things you'll note is how different this drop light's appearance is from ordinary drop lights. While the overall shape and design appearance is the same, it is somewhat stouter and much more rugged looking. This is due to the necessity of incorporating a stronger basic body assembly. As well as sealing possible sources of ignition from contact with flammable dust or vapors, the assembly must be able to contain any ignition of gases within its housing; if a bulb were to explode, or gases to get inside and ignite, the housing is capable of containing these long enough for them to cool below ignition temperatures before they can escape. In a traditional drop light, there is no sealing, and the assembly is a great deal less rugged.<br/><br/>The next thing you would notice is that the lamp is constructed of non sparking materials. The body is made from high strength composites, the metal cage and lamp housing is aluminum, and the cord is chemical and abrasion resistant. This allows the lamp to be accidentally dropped, and greatly reduces the chances that an errant spark is created when it contacts the ground. Further enhancing the safety of the lamp is a clear impact resistant enclosure that seals the bulb itself from the outside environment. The bulb and the enclosure are both protected from impacts by a strong aluminum cage, reducing the chances of damages from impacts. Traditional drop lights have little to no concern for the metals used in construction aside from production cost, and rely on thin steel and tin for most of their metallic components.<br/><br/>In this particular lamp, LEDs are used instead of a typical incandescent or fluorescent bulb. These LEDs create less heat than traditional bulbs, and produce a greater amount of light with less power. As well as being more efficient, the LEDs are also a great deal more resistant to damage from dropping or impacts. Traditional bulbs rely on a fragile tungsten filament to produce light through resistance to electrical current. This fragile filament is easily broken by vibration or impacts. As well as being easily damaged, a traditional bulb relies on a gas filled enclosure surrounding the filament to increase the life of the filament. This glass enclosure is also easily broken, and represents an ignition hazard if it breaks during use and exposes the hot filament to an explosive atmosphere. With the LED bulb, there is no gas filled enclosure to break, and no heated filament to present an ignition source. This has the effect of further improving this lamps resistance to creating an errant ignition source.<br/><br/>Lastly, you'll note that all the parts of this assembly are tightly and securely sealed together. Unlike traditional lamps, all the seams and connections are sealed with gaskets and fillers that isolate the internal electronics of the unit from the outside. Contaminants are kept out, and possible ignitions are kept in, removing the possibility of a chance ignition of the volatile compounds that may be present.<br/><br/>As well as being ruggedly designed and explosion proof, this lamp is also very energy efficient. The LED bulb uses a fraction of the power a normal bulb consumes. At only 7 watts, this LED lamp produces the light equivalent of a standard 100 watt incandescent. The life of the LED is significantly longer as well, with the LED bulb rated at approximately 50,000 hours of life, while a traditional incandescent is typically rated well below 5000 hours. This means less trouble and expense with replacing the bulb. As well as consuming less energy, the LED bulb produces far less heat. In a standard drop light, none of the above features are present. It is commonly understood that frequent bulb replacements and occasional burns from contact with the hot housing assembly are a part of using the standard incandescent lamp. Not so with LEDs.<br/><br/>As you can see, there is a great deal of consideration and design that goes into creating a high quality piece of explosion proof equipment. Although the basic premise is still to produce a simple and efficient source of illumination, the added requirements of an explosion proof rating increases the demands for durability and ruggedness. In these lamps provided by Larson Electronics, those requirements are met and exceeded. | Cén fáth a bhfuil Solas Cruthúnas pléascadh difriúil?<br/>(422/2010) Nuair a bhíonn na coinníollacha ceart in aon cheann de na suímh seo, is é an t-aon rud a choinníonn an t-aon rud nach féidir a shamhlú ó tharla ná an easpa foinse adhainte. In atmaisféar a tháinig chun bheith truaillithe le gáis so-ghalaithe, nó go mór sáithithe le deannach indóite, go léir a thógann sé ar cheann spréach beag bídeach a shocrú i tairiscint slabhra na n-imoibrithe is féidir mar thoradh ar thinte, pléascanna agus gortuithe.<br/><br/>I go leor de na suímh, tá sé i ndáiríre coitianta le haghaidh atmaisféar inadhainte a bheith i láthair, agus níl aon bhealach praiticiúil a sheachaint go hiomlán ar na coinníollacha seo a tháirgeadh. Toisc go gcruthófar na coinníollacha seo go minic mar chuid de ghnáthoibríochtaí an tionscail agus nach féidir iad a faillí go hiomlán, is é an chéad réiteach soiléir eile ná gach foinse tionscnaimh a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ann a bhaint. Tá sé níos éasca é seo a dhéanamh ná a dhéanamh, ós rud é go bhfuil an oiread sin foinsí ann nach mór a chur san áireamh.Is foinsí féideartha tionscnaimh iad gach rud ó lasca éadrom go lucht leanúna, agus ní féidir iad a bhaint go hiomlán ar an spás oibre. Tá sé mar gheall ar seo go bhfuil leaganacha speisialaithe de threalamh nach mór a oibriú sna timpeallachtaí guaiseacha seo forbartha agus sainordú iad a úsáid in áiteanna guaiseacha i OSHA.<br/><br/>Tá roinnt rátálacha agus catagóirí ag trealamh le húsáid in áiteanna guaiseacha a léiríonn oiriúnacht an trealaimh le húsáid ag brath ar an leibhéal contúirte a d’fhéadfadh suíomh áirithe a chruthú. Maidir le foinsí adhainte a rialú, pléann an chuid is mó de na rialacháin maidir le trealamh leictreach atá thar a bheith sábháilte, nó trealamh cruthúnas pléascadh a bhainistiú.Tá na difríochtaí idir an dá cheann caolchúiseach, ach tábhachtach. Go bunúsach is trealamh atá thar a bheith sábháilte aon trealamh atá in ann a tháirgeadh go leor fuinnimh a chur faoi deara adhainte. Tagraíonn cruthúnas pléascadh do threalamh a fhéadann foinsídhainte a bheith ann agus a leithlisiú, iad a chosc ó theagmháil a dhéanamh leis an aer oscailte.Is léir go mbeadh sé sábháilte an rátáil sábháilteachta is airde, agus go deimhin tá sé. Tá trealamh rátáilte go tionsclaíoch oiriúnach le húsáid sna grúpaí agus sna rátálacha suímh contúirteacha go léir mar a shainítear iad i rialacháin OSHA. In ainneoin seo, ní hé trealamh atá go bunúsach sábháilte an rogha is fearr i gcónaí mar gheall ar na teorainneacha a chruthaíonn a chostais níos airde agus tréithe cumhachta íseal go ginearálta.<br/><br/>Níl trealamh cruthúnas pléascadh ar an láimh eile mar atá srianta ag na teorainneacha a fhorchuirtear leis an rátáil intrially sábháilte, agus ceadaíonn sé do speictream níos leithne agus níos cumhachtaí trealaimh a úsáid, agus ar chostas níos saoire. Ós rud é nach n-éilíonn an rátáil cruthúnas pléascadh ach go bhfuil foinsí adhainte, agus go gcoinneofar teochtaí faoi bhun leibhéil áirithe maidir le rátálacha roinnte éagsúla, is féidir le dearadh bunúsach an trealaimh fanacht slán, le dearadh breise corpraithe chun a chuid foinsí aitheanta a bheith ann de ghnáth. Bheadh sampla bunúsach ina athrú solais simplí. I ngnáthdhálaí, tá pointe teagmhála ag athrú éadrom ina gcuirtear dhá sheoltóir miotail i dteagmháil lena chéile chun ciorcad dúnta a fhoirmiú, rud a aistríonn fuinneamh leictreach chuig an lampa.<br/><br/>Is ag an bpointe teagmhála seo a cruthaíodh foinse adhainte féideartha mar go dtagann an dá sheoltóirí i dteagmháil lena chéile agus go dtáirgeann siad spréach beag nó stua. Is féidir le haonrú an spréach seo a bheith chomh simplí le an t-aistriú iomlán a mhéadú laistigh de taobh amuigh séalaithe agus neamh-seoltaí mar rubar, agus ar an gcaoi sin an chuid seoltaí den lasc a bhaint as teagmháil leis an atmaisféar lasmuigh. Is sampla an-simplithe é seo, ach léiríonn sé an bunáit. Chun tuiscint níos fearr a fháil ar an mbonn iomlán taobh thiar de chruthúnas pléascadh trealaimh leictreach a dhéanamh, agus díreach cé mhéad atá bainteach leis an dearadh, is fearr breathnú ar rud éigin beagán níos casta.<br/><br/>Ceann de na chéad rudaí go mbainfidh tú faoi deara cé chomh difriúil is atá cuma an tsolais titim seo ó ghnáthsoilse titim.Cé go bhfuil an cruth foriomlán agus an chuma ar an dearadh mar an gcéanna, tá sé beagán stóráil agus i bhfad níos garbh breathnú. Tá sé seo mar gheall ar an ngá atá le tionól comhlacht bunúsach níos láidre a ionchorprú. Chomh maith le foinsí is féidir adhainte ó theagmháil le deannach nó gals inadhainte, caithfidh an tionól a bheith in ann aon adhainte gáis laistigh dá thithíocht; dá mba rud é go raibh bolgán le pléascadh, nó gáis a fháil taobh istigh agus adhainte, tá an tithíocht in ann iad seo a choinneáil fada go leor chun teocht adhainte a fhuarú sular féidir leo éalú. I bhfianaise titim traidisiúnta, níl aon séalaithe ann, agus is mór an tionól níos lú garbh é.<br/><br/>Is é an chéad rud eile a dtabharfadh tú faoi deara ná go ndéantar an lampa a thógáil d’ábhair neamhshiúl súilíneacha.Déantar an corp as comhpháirteanna ard-neart, tá an cage miotail agus an tithíocht lampa alúmanam, agus tá an corda resistant ceimiceach agus abrasion. Ligeann sé seo an lampa a bheith titim de thaisme, agus go mór laghdaíonn an seans go bhfuil Spark torrent cruthaithe nuair a bhíonn sé i dteagmháil leis an talamh. Is éard atá i gceist le sábháilteacht an lampa ná imfhálú soiléir resistant a shéalann an bolgán féin ón timpeallacht lasmuigh. Déantar an bolgán agus an imfhálú a chosaint ó thionchair ag cage láidir alúmanaim, ag laghdú an seans go ndéanfar damáiste ó thionchair. Níl mórán imní ag soilse titim traidisiúnta maidir leis na miotail a úsáidtear i dtógáil ar leataobh ó chostas táirgthe, agus brath ar chruach tanaí agus stáin don chuid is mó dá chomhpháirteanna miotalacha.<br/><br/>Sa lampa ar leith, Úsáidtear soilse in ionad bolgán gealbhruthach nó fluaraiseacha tipiciúil.Cruthaíonn na soilse seo níos lú teas ná bolgáin thraidisiúnta, agus cuireann siad méid níos mó solais ar fáil le níos lú cumhachta. Chomh maith le a bheith níos éifeachtaí, tá na soilse freisin ina déileáil níos resistant le damáiste ó thitim nó tionchair.Braitheann bolgáin traidisiúnta ar fhiliméad tungstain leochaileach a tháirgeadh solas trí fhriotaíocht le sruth leictreach. Déantar an fhiliméad leochaileach seo a bhriseadh go héasca de bharr creathadh nó tionchair.Chomh maith leis a bheith damáiste go héasca, braitheann bolgán traidisiúnta ar fhál gáis atá timpeallaithe ag an bhfiliméad chun saol an fhiliméad a mhéadú. Tá an imfhálú gloine seo briste go héasca freisin, agus léiríonn sé guais adhainte má bhriseann sé le linn úsáide agus má nochtann sé an fhiliméad te chuig atmaisféar pléascach. Leis an bolgán LED, níl aon imfhálú líonadh gáis le briseadh, agus gan aon fhiliméad téite chun foinse adhainte a chur i láthair.Tá sé seo mar éifeacht ag friotaíocht an lampaí seo a fheabhsú tuilleadh le foinse adhainte iontrála a chruthú.<br/><br/>Ar deireadh, tabharfaidh tú faoi deara go bhfuil na codanna uile den tionól seo séalaithe go docht agus go daingean le chéile.Murab ionann agus lampaí traidisiúnta, tá na seams agus na naisc go léir séalaithe le gaiscéid agus líontóirí a scarann le leictreonaic inmheánacha an aonaid ón taobh amuigh. Coimeádtar éillithe amach, agus coinnítear adhainteí féideartha isteach, ag baint amach an bhféidearthacht go dtarlódh tionscnamh seans de na comhdhúile so-ghalaithe a d'fhéadfadh a bheith i láthair.<br/><br/>Chomh maith le bheith deartha go garbh agus cruthúnas pléascadh, tá an lampa freisin an-éifeachtach ó thaobh fuinnimh.Úsáideann an bolgán LED codán den chumhacht a ídíonn bolgán gnáth. Ag ach 7 vata, táirgeann an lampa faoi stiúir an choibhéis solais de bhanda 100 bhata caighdeánach. Tá saol na LED i bhfad níos faide chomh maith, leis an bolgán LED rátáil ag thart ar 50,000 uair an chloig den saol, cé go bhfuil gealbhruthach traidisiúnta rátáil go maith faoi bhun 5000 uair an chloig. ciallaíonn sé seo deacracht níos lú agus ar chostas le teacht in ionad an bolgán. Chomh maith le Tógann sé níos lú fuinnimh, táirgeann an bolgán LED teas i bhfad níos lú.I bhfianaise titim chaighdeánach, níl aon cheann de na gnéithe thuas i láthair. Tuigtear go coitianta go mbíonn athsholáthar bolgáin go minic agus dónna ó theagmháil leis an tionól tithíochta te mar chuid den lampa geal caighdeánach a úsáid.Ní mar sin le soilse.<br/><br/>Mar a fheiceann tú, tá go leor smaoineamh agus dearadh ann a théann i gcruthú píosa ardchaighdeáin trealaimh cruthúnas pléascadh. Cé go bhfuil an t-áitreabh bunúsach fós chun foinse soilsithe simplí agus éifeachtach a tháirgeadh, méadaíonn na ceanglais bhreise de rátáil cruthúnas pléascadh na héilimh ar marthanacht agus ar ghairis. Sna lampaí ar fáil ag Laserson Electronics, na riachtanais a chomhlíonadh agus a shárú. |
