| Also in this Section<br/><br/>The star, 43, told The Hollywood Reporter that she thought her character Rachel and Ross (David Schwimmer) would still be "absolutely, 100 per cent together" and would have "more kids!" .<br/><br/>But she said the long-running show would not translate to the big screen.<br/><br/>"Friends is in your living room, Friends is not in a movie theatre. It doesn't make sense to me. I think it would be going against its authentic self," she said.<br/><br/>"I can't imagine how you would do it, unless you did it years from now. Then it would be: 'Who are these guys? What are we watching?' I can't imagine what that would be. It's not normal," Jennifer said.<br/><br/>The actress, who recently attended a ceremony to put her star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, said she hadn't ruled out a return to TV.<br/><br/>"It would probably take those five actors and be somewhere where we left off," the Wanderlust star said.<br/><br/>"I loved what I did for 10 years; it was pure joy and nothing but fun, and it'd be hard to top it."<br/><br/>"The way we sort of felt the excitement of what Friends was when it started, it would have to be something where you felt a similar charge. But I'll never ever say never | Chomh maith leis sin sa Roinn seo<br/><br/>Dúirt an réalta, 43, leis an Tuairisceoir Hollywood gur cheap sí go mbeadh a carachtar Rachel agus Ross (David Schwimmer) fós "go hiomlán, 100 faoin gcéad le chéile" agus go mbeadh " páistí níos mó!"<br/><br/>Ach dúirt sí nach n-aistreofar an seó fada go dtí an scáileán mór.<br/><br/>Tá "Cairde i do sheomra suí, nach bhfuil cairde i amharclann scannáin., Ní chuireann sé ciall dom. Sílim go mbeadh sé ag dul i gcoinne a chuid féin barántúla," a dúirt sí.<br/><br/>Is é ‘Ní féidir liom a shamhlú conas ba mhaith leat é a dhéanamh, ach amháin má rinne tú é blianta as seo amach, bheadh sé: ‘Cé hiad na daoine seo?’ Cad iad na daoine atá á bhreathnú againn?’ Ní féidir liom a shamhlú cad a bheadh ann.<br/><br/>Dúirt an t-aisteoir, a d'fhreastail ar shearmanas le déanaí chun a réalta a chur ar an Siúlóid Hollywood Of Fame, nár rialaigh sí filleadh ar an teilifís.<br/><br/>Is dócha go dtógfadh sé na cúig aisteoir sin agus a bheith áit éigin inar fhág muid amach," a dúirt an réalta Wanderlust.<br/><br/>Ba bhreá liom an rud a rinne mé ar feadh 10 mbliana; bhí sé fíor-áthas agus rud ar bith ach spraoi, agus bheadh sé deacair é a bhreisiú."<br/><br/>"An bealach a bhraith muid an excitement de cad a bhí Cairde nuair a thosaigh sé, bheadh sé a bheith rud éigin nuair a mhothaigh tú muirear den chineál céanna., Ach ní bheidh mé ag rá riamh riamh |
| Location<br/><br/>The ephemeral nature of New Zealand's screen production industry presents particular challenges for the introduction of environmentally responsible practices. One of these challenges is reducing the environmental impacts associated with working on location including special effects that may involve the use of fire, explosives, water and artificial snow. With no fixed office or studio base, it can be difficult for productions to develop and maintain environmental management systems. The suggestions below have been developed to assist screen production companies and professionals in managing their environmental impacts on location.<br/><br/>Protected environments<br/><br/>Follow the Department of Conservation guidelines and code of practice for Commercial Filming on Public Conservation Lands and ensure that any concessions required are in place.<br/>Educate cast, crew and extras about why the location is a protected environment.<br/>Minimise the number of vehicles and people at any one location and use transportation and technical equipment respectfully with regard to the landscape and animal habitats.<br/>Ensure all rubbish is well contained while on location, and remove and dispose of all rubbish responsibly.<br/>Cordon off areas that are particularly sensitive and mark the appropriate path for walkways and vehicles. Ensure these paths are also clearly marked on the daily call sheet.<br/>Ensure that the unit is carrying spill kits in the case of a fuel spill.<br/>Evaluate the location when filming is complete to identify any damage that may have occurred during filming. If damage has occurred, ensure it is rectified appropriately and in cooperation with the relevant authorities.<br/><br/>Natural, historical and cultural heritage is protected because it is special. For that very reason, these sites are highly desirable as film sets. Working sensitively and collaborating with the relevant authorities such as the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) is essential for the success of the production. Failure to gain permission from the relevant authorities and follow requirements can lead to enforcement action, prosecution, adverse publicity, and spoil it for other producers wishing to use the location – a risk not worth taking. | Suíomh<br/><br/>Cuireann cineál ephemeral tionscal táirgeachta scáileáin na Nua-Shéalainn dúshláin ar leith i láthair chun cleachtais atá freagrach ó thaobh an chomhshaoil a thabhairt isteach.

| Statistics 101: Fall 2011<br/>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference<br/><br/>Professor Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<br/><br/>Course goals & objectives:<br/><br/>The overall goal of this class is to introduce you to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data and not as a branch of mathematics. This class is designed to provide you with the tools you need for solving real world problems using statistics and a better understanding of the process of scientific research and statistical inference.<br/><br/>By the end of this class you should be able to interpret statistical results in context and critique news stories and journal articles that include statistical information. We expect you to be comfortable with concepts such as association and causation, random sampling and random assignment, statistical bias and statistical significance, and to understand and appreciate why real data beats anecdotes.<br/><br/>We plan to achieve these goals by introducing you to the relevant statistical knowledge, teaching you how to use an open source (i.e. free!) statistical software called RStudio to perform data analysis, and having you engage in problem solving, application, analysis, and synthesis of statistical information through homework, labs, quizzes and exams.<br/><br/>Please see the syllabus for detailed information on the course, policies, and grading. All course materials are posted on the schedule page (lecture notes, labs, assignments, etc.). | Staitisticí 101: Fall 2011<br/>Anailís ar Shonraí agus trasnaíocht Staidrimh<br/><br/>An tOllamh Mianach Çetintkaya-R Rundel<br/><br/>Spriocanna agus cuspóirí an chúrsa:<br/><br/>Is é sprioc fhoriomlán an ranga seo ná tú a thabhairt isteach i ndisciplín staitisticí mar eolaíochta chun sonraí a thuiscint agus a anailísiú agus ní mar bhrainse den mhatamaitic.

| .<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Wednesday, April 6, 2011<br/><br/>They'd found her lying in the dirt, fifty feet off the road, cold and filthy, barely alive.<br/>Now Matthew knelt in the back of the ambulance and checked the oxygen mask strapped to the old woman's face, pressed his stethoscope to her nightgown and heard a dry rattling, more like the snap of shuffled cards than a steady whooshing.<br/>His surgical shears parted the rotten cloth of her right pajama leg. Her calf muscle was gone, torn away, ragged ends of veins and ligaments hanging from her thigh like wires from a half built electrical device.<br/>Speechless, he touched her tibia, wondering if arthritis could have gnarled the bone, or turned it brown and ridged, so much like a knotted walking stick. He exhaled through his nose and turned away. "Harry?" he said, unsure what words would come next.<br/>"I'm driving as fast as I can, ok? Any faster and the ambulance is going to turn over," Harry shouted over the diesel roar of the engine. "These windy back roads are a freaking nightmare. How's she doing?"<br/>"Not so good, Harry." he whispered. He'd cut away the cloth on her other leg and found it fuzzed and green. Beyond rational thought, his training guided his shears up through the damp wool of her nightgown, crotch to throat in one easy slice.<br/>Matthew dropped the shears and sat down hard on the corrugated steel floor. Her torso was fleshless, exposed. And infested. Something, some blind rodent squeezed through the flexing tunnel of her small intestine. Her lungs were twin blackbirds. One of them turned it's head and looked at him, with the bored, unimpressed manner of all birds, everywhere, peering through the wooden rails of her ribcage. He and his brother ruffled their wings, fluffing gently with each breath.<br/>The corner of her mouth twitched. Between the black feathers of her lungs, where her heart should be, something raw shifted and turned away from the light.<br/>Matthew leaned forward, peeled back one eyelid with his thumb, gripping a penlight in his fist like a stabbers knife, and shone the light into her eye. He'd expected a maggoty hole, or at best a milky cataract, but her pupils were clear, the sclera as clean and white as a healthy child's. The iris was rich amber, with emerald and sapphire chips. It glittered like some masterwork in a jewelers case.<br/>The pupil contracted at the light's rude penetration, and her jaw fell open, and she screamed, a deafening howl like a tornado tearing through a thousand dead trees. He fell hard as the ambulance jerked to the right, and in a sickening instant he felt Harry's shock at the sudden noise, his panicked overcorrection, the skipping tires on patchy asphalt, his own body weightless as the truck began to tip, balancing for an instant on two tires, off the road into a gulley before an oak tree punched through the grille and he was dashed against a wall and knocked senseless.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Chewing, he thought. Something eating something?<br/>What is. Where am?<br/>Matthew was awake but didn't know it yet. Sensation happened without forming a coherent whole. Pain in a hundred small places and one or two big ones, and he shifted to relieve an unbearable and growing ache in his knee, which brought mind and body slowly back together.<br/>He lay on the ceiling of the overturned ambulance. The white square wrappers of medical supplies drifted everywhere, rendering the boxy interior snowy and unreal. A heavy white suitcase lay atop his broken leg. He moaned in pain and confusion.<br/>The chewing stopped. He could hear something dripping. Then a long breath drawn by shuddering wings, and he remembered the woman on the stretcher, now crouched and feasting upon his partners half-hollowed torso. Two amber rings, flecked with blue and green, found him in the dark. Then it lunged.<br/>He kicked blindly and his toe caught the metal door that separated the cabin from the rear of the ambulance, snapping it shut just as the thing leapt. It impacted wetly against the reinforced steel, then found the window and wriggled through, fingernails like tiny shells slashing purple stripes into his legs. Matthew shrank away and saw that the creature was stuck, the edges of the window now wedged into the spaces between it's ribs.<br/>Blood pulsed out of his thighs in a hot and spreading pool. The thing strained forwards, it's ribs flexing and cracking, like it would have him even if it meant tearing itself in two. He wriggled to the back door found it sealed shut, the handle bashed and useless.<br/>White flashes started to interrupt the flow of his vision as he began to slip into shock. In staccato bursts, he saw the thing, now through to it's hips. The white suitcase. His ruined legs. The suitcase.<br/>The suitcase. Of course! The creature's hand seized his ankle, and he slapped it away, heaved the suitcase onto his chest and thumbed the latches open. The ON button depressed with a satisfying click. The thing was through the hole. The suitcase chirped, then chimed. She was upon him, clawing her way up his body. He snatched the paddles and pressed them against her chest. A single blackbird eye peered out at him.<br/>A blast of electricity shot through her corrupted body. Her chest was a flurry of panicked wings that burst into flames just after the third jolt, just before the defibrillator's battery died. She fell back, stinking smoke pouring from her mouth. Matthew smiled. As consciousness slipped away, he thought he could again hear chewing, though it was a smaller sound than before. Like a rat gnawing through a wall. Or out of it's cage.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In the ashen dawn, some hours later, Matthew struggled through the shattered windshield and rose to his feet. He breathed in the cold morning air, black wings shuddering in his chest. Between them, in his core, something raw shifted and turned in it's new nest.<br/>He was hungry. He began to walk.<br/><br/>- - - Raised among the Hill Clans of Western Massachusetts, Mr. Hooke now lives and works in Philadelphia.

Schaffer was inspired to write the play after hearing a true story; a crime involving a teenage boy's seemingly motiveless violence and injury to horses. Equus is a fictional account of what Schaffer believes could have happened before the incident, helping to explain the psychology and reasoning behind the boy's mysterious and disturbing crime. Equus follows closely the character of 17 - year-old boy Alan Strang, but also his psychiatrist, Martin Dysart. In this piece of writing, I plan to explain how we explored the play of Equus in a variety of different activities within our drama class.<br/><br/>Response<br/><br/>The play opens with Martin Dysart, the psychiatrist, performing a soliloquy that introduces the main themes of the play. Scene one is devoted entirely to this speech, which shows its importance and vitality. We learn much about Dysart from this speech. For example, the line "All reined up in old/language and old assumptions" illustrates how he feels trapped and frustrated in his life. In addition, he says, "I'm desperate" which shows his exhaustion and frustration. | Déanann an dráma "Equus" le Peter Schaffer imscrúdú ar smaointe an chreidimh, paisean, foréigean agus gnéasachta óg. Spreag Schaffer chun an dráma a scríobh tar éis scéal fíor a chloisteáil; coir a raibh foréigean agus gortú atá cosúil le déagóirí ag baint leis. Is cuntas ficseanúil den mhéid a gcreideann Schaffer gur tharla sé roimh an eachtra, ag cabhrú leis an síceolaíocht agus réasúnaíocht taobh thiar d’ coireachta mistéireach cur isteach an bhuachaill a mhíniú. Leanann Equus go dlúth leis an gcarachtar de 17 - bliain d'aois buachaill Alan Strang, ach freisin a shíciatra, Martin Dysart. Sa phíosa scríbhneoireachta seo, tá sé i gceist agam a mhíniú conas a thaiscéaladh an dráma Eachach i ngníomhaíochtaí éagsúla laistigh dár rang drámaíochta.<br/><br/>Freagra<br/><br/>Osclaíonn an dráma le Martin Dysart, an síciatraí, ag feidhmiú ina n-aonar a thugann isteach príomhthéamaí an dráma.Tá radharc amháin dírithe go hiomlán ar an óráid seo, a léiríonn tábhacht agus beogacht an dráma.Bímid i bhfad faoi Dysart ón óráid seo. Mar shampla, léiríonn an líne "Gach fhan suas i sean-theanga agus sean-thuairimí" conas a mhothaíonn sé gafa agus frustrachas ina shaol. Ina theannta sin, deir sé, "Tá mé éadóchasach" a léiríonn a ídiú agus a frustrachas. |
