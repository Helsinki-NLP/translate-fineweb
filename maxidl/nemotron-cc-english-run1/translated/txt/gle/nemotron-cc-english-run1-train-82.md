In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blag Deimhniúcháin CPR ar líne<br/><br/>Dáta: 23 Iúil, 2014<br/><br/>Is bailiúchán neamhchoitianta é galar duáin idirmheánach na ngluaisteán de ghalair a théann i bhfeidhm ar fheidhmeanna aitheanta na duáin.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Caitheamh aimsire' vs Cuntas Locke ar Staid an Dúlra<br/><br/>Topics: Fealsúnachta Word: 2539Pages: 9 Lún 3 Lún, 2021<br/><br/>Tá caitheamh aimsire agus Locke ar na fealsamh polaitiúil is mó tionchair le scríobh riamh i mBéarla. Is é an staid an nádúir, a chuireann roimh eagrú na sochaithe casta, an t-áitreabh coitianta a roinneann Caitheamh aimsire agus Locke ach a dhéanann léirmhíniú ar bhealaí éagsúla. Is é an chéad dearcadh atá ag an duine ar a staid nádúrtha chomh contúirteach agus saor in aisce a spriocanna geografacha a shaothrú, gan trácht ar an gceartas, agus is é sin an fáth go bhfuil a stát nádúrtha ina chúis leis an "cogadh de gach fear i gcoinne gach fear" (obbes76). Ar an láimh eile, breathnaíonn sé ar dhaoine ina riocht bunaidh mar saoirse nádúrtha atá chomh luachmhar céanna agus a chuireann srian ar shaoirse nádúrtha tríd an smaoineamh ceartais a éilíonn gan dochar a dhéanamh do dhaoine eile, rud a cheadaíonn staid an dúlra a shainmhíniú mar "cúnamh frithpháirteach agus caomhnú" seachas cogadh (Locke 15). Is é an príomhdhifríocht idir an dá chuntas fealsamh de stáit nádúrtha ná go n-úsáideann Locke cúinsí eiticiúla agus ní chuireann caitheamh aimsire ar bun sa deireadh chun stát a cheapadh a fheidhmíonn cumhacht neamhtheoranta thar dhaoine, agus cuireann Locke teorainn ar an rialtas de réir na bprionsabal morálta, a mheasann sé dlí nádúrtha.<br/><br/>bunaíonn caitheamh aimsire a thoimhdí maidir le staid an nádúir ar an bhfíric go bhfuil gach duine comhionann go garbh ina gcumas fisiceach agus meabhrach. Admhaíonn sé go bhféadfadh roinnt daoine neart coirp nó intleacht níos fearr a léiriú ach go n-éilíonn sé sin "nuair a chuirtear gach duine i dteannta a chéile, nach bhfuil an difríocht idir fear agus fear chomh suntasach" (Tábes 74). Ós rud é go bhfuil daoine cothrom go garbh ina gcumais, tá súil acu freisin a gcuid foircinn a bhaint amach agus a gcuid riachtanas a shásamh (Hobs 75). Mar thoradh loighciúil den chomhionannas seo, nuair a thosaíonn na daoine ag iomaíocht le haghaidh acmhainní gann, b’fhéidir nach mbraitheann aon duine slán go hiomlán ina sheilbh. Fiú má éiríonn le duine mighty, cunning agus cumasach i subjuging "na daoine de gach fear is féidir leis," ní ráthaíonn sé fós an tslándáil deiridh (Pobs 75). Toisc nach féidir le duine ar bith a leithéid de superiority a fháil thar na daoine eile a dhéanann dó nó di go uttery imdhíonachta ar a neart na hintleachta, ní féidir aon duine a bhraitheann go hiomlán sábháilte nuair timpeallaithe ag a chomhionann. Is ionann comhionannas caitheamh aimsire sa stát nádúrtha agus eagla, áit a bhfeiceann gach duine ar a chéile mar iomaitheoirí contúirteacha.<br/><br/>Díreach mar a mheasann Caitheamh aimsire, Locke go bhfuil gach duine comhionann go bunúsach, ach sanntar brí an-difriúil leis an téarma.Ón dearcadh atá aige, ní hé an comhionannas cumais é, ach, ina ionad sin, an comhionannas luacha. Tugann sé le fios gur cheart go mbainfeadh na daoine “a rugadh go mór do na buntáistí céanna sa nádúr” taitneamh as an gcomhionannas foirfe ina measc go loighciúil, toisc nach bhfuil aon chúis ann le breithniú ar dhuine ar bith níos luachmhaire go bunúsach (Locke 8). Bheadh an t-aon bhunús a d’fhéadfadh a bheith ann chun daoine áirithe a ainmniú níos fearr do dhaoine eile dá ndéanfadh Dia "trí dhearbhú léirithe a thoil, ceann amháin os cionn a chéile" (Locke 8). Ós rud é go bhfuil smachtbhanna diaga den scoth den sórt sin as láthair, tugann Locke le fios nach n-éilítear comhionannas nádúrtha ionadaithe uile an duine i gceist. Cuireann caitheamh aimsire a coibhéis go pragmatach agus cuireann sé i bhfáth go bhfuil daoine ina staid nádúrtha chomh contúirteach céanna, ach fostaíonn Locke cur chuige eiticiúil agus cuireann sé béim ar go bhfuil daoine chomh luachmhar céanna i súile Dé. Is é an easaontas é seo ach an chéad difríocht idir an dá údar bunaithe ar an bhfíric go n-áirítear Locke mar áitreabh ina fhealsúnacht pholaitiúil, cé nach bhfuil Hobbs.<br/><br/>Gné shainiúil eile de chuntas Caitheamh aimsire ar an staid nádúrtha é a léirmhíniú saoirse.De réir Caitheamh aimsire, tugann an staid an dúlra le tuiscint saoirse gan teorainn a dhéanamh is cuma cad is gá chun a bheith ann go leanúnach. Sainíonn an fealsamh saoirse mar "láithreachas seachtrach" maidir le cumais duine a úsáid chun spriocanna duine amháin a bhaint amach (Hobs 79). Is é príomhchuspóir gach dúthracht ná a bheith ann go fóill. Mar thoradh air sin, is ionann saoirse caitheamh aimsire agus an deis gan teorainn chun aon rud a dhéanamh a d’oirfeadh is fearr, i mbreithiúnas duine, do shaol agus do sheilbh duine a chaomhnú (Pobs 79). Is é an t-aon teorannú ar shaoirse ná nach féidir le duine aon rud a dhéanamh salach ar a shaol nó ar a saol a chothú nó “an modh chun an rud céanna a chaomhnú” ( Hobbs 79). Seachas sin, níl aon teorainneacha ann, agus tá "ceart ag gach duine gach rud, fiú go corp duine eile" má chuireann sé sin slán (Hobs 80). Dá bhrí sin, is é saoirse nádúrtha, mar a bhreathnaíonn Caitheamh aimsire, easpa constaicí atá i bhfeidhm go seachtrach le linn a bheith ag leanúint ceart gach rud a chothú agus a dhaingniú go leanúnach ar a bheith ann.<br/><br/>Chomh maith leis sin, cosnaíonn Locke an smaoineamh ar shaoirse nádúrtha ach cuireann sé chuige i slí nach ionadh é atá an-éagsúil ó thaobh caitheamh aimsire de. Chomh luath agus a thosaíonn sé ag plé saoirse i staid an nádúir, tugann sé faoi deara láithreach nach ionann stát saoirse "a staid ceadúnais" (Lock 9). Aithníonn an fealsamh dhá theorainn shonracha le saoirse an duine i staid an nádúir. Is é an chéad cheann comhionann leis an gceann a thugann Caitheamh aimsire isteach: mar sin féin, saor ó tháille agus neamhspleách, mar sin féin "nach bhfuil saoirse aige é féin a scriosadh" (Lock 9). De réir Locke, tá sé de dhualgas nádúrtha ar gach duine gan dochar a dhéanamh do “aon duine eile ina shaol, ina shláinte, ina shaoirse nó ina sheilbh” (9). Díreach mar a bhfuil a léirmhíniú ar chomhionannas, bunaíonn an t-údar an dearbhú seo ar fhorais eiticiúla agus reiligiúnacha: ba cheart do dhaoine a bheith ann dá chéile ós rud é go bhfuil siad ar fad ag cruthú an “omnipotent” céanna, agus go bhfuil siad ciallmhar ar feadh tréimhse éiginnte (Locke 9. Dá bhrí sin, tá saoirse ag Locke sa stát nádúrtha i bhfad níos déine ná Caitheamh aimsire ach an oibleagáid a thabhairt isteach chun staonadh ó dochar a dhéanamh don duine féin agus do na daoine eile araon.<br/><br/>Na difríochtaí idir an dá údar léiriú chomh maith ina gcuntais an cheartais i staid nádúrtha na daonnachta., Chomh fada agus a bhaineann Caitheamh aimsire, is é an t-ábhar ar an dlí amháin a leagan síos. Níl aon dlínse i staid an nádúir, agus is é an dlí amháin a rialaíonn daoine ina riocht bunaidh dlí nádúrtha a chuireann iallach orthu slándáil phearsanta a lorg. Mar thoradh air sin, ní féidir aon rud a bheith éagórach i staid bhunaidh an chine daonna: níl aon áit ag na "nótaí cearta agus éagóir éagóir mícheart" agus níl aon bhrí aige in éagmais an dlí atá i bhfeidhm go docht (obbes 78). Chomh fada agus a úsáideann na daoine a saoirse beagnach gan teorainn chun dul san iomaíocht go neamhthrócaireach lena chéile le haghaidh acmhainní, a bhfuil siad i dteideal go cothrom, níl aon chritéir acu chun idirdhealú a dhéanamh idir gníomhartha díreach agus éagóracha. Dá bhrí sin, sainmhíníonn stát nádúr an-smaoineamh an cheartais ós rud é go ndéanann an t-údar é a léirmhíniú mar fheidhm amháin den dlí foirmitheach agus seanbhunaithe.<br/><br/>Sannann Locke brí éagsúil leis an gceartas agus déanann sé an oiread sin sa reachtaíocht agus atá sna téarmaí eiticiúla a fheiceáil. Luaigh an páipéar seo cheana, murab ionann agus caitheamh aimsire, go n-úsáideann Locke nótaí eiticiúla agus go ginearálta bunaíonn sé a fhealsúnacht pholaitiúil maidir le meon morálta seachas toimhdean atá praiticiúil go hiomlán. Mar thoradh air sin, murab ionann agus dlí nádúrtha Locke, cuirtear iallach ar dhaoine aire a thabhairt dá chéile seachas gach duine a fhágáil leo féin. Mar thoradh air sin, tá áit ann don cheartas agus don éagóir ina staid féin. Léiríonn an t-údar leis an bhfíric seo é féin nuair a thugann sé faoi deara nár cheart do dhuine ar bith eile a bheatha nó a saol a chaomhnú "mura bhfuil sé a dhéanamh ceartais ar chiontóir" (Lock 9). Léiríonn an ráiteas seo an soiléireacht is mó atá ann, de réir Locke, i staid an nádúir, agus ina theannta sin, caithfidh daoine é a chaomhnú go gníomhach. Is é an critéar ceartais, a bhfuil an stádas stáit nádúrtha ag Caitheamh aimsire ann, an dara teorainn ar shaoirse nádúrtha a fhorchuirtear le Locke: ní féidir gníomh a dhéanamh mura bhfuil údar leis ach le duine eile a bheith ina bhagairt nach bhfuil údar leis.<br/><br/>Na difríochtaí sin sa dá chóireáil a dhéanann údair an chomhionannais, na saoirse, an cheartais agus an éagóir a chur i gcrích ina léirmhíniú ar an ngaol idir an staid an nádúir agus an staid chogaidh. Ó thaobh Caitheamh aimsire de, tá an dá rud comhchiallach, toisc gurb é an iomaíocht neamhthrócaireach an t-aon toradh loighciúil a bhaineann le daoine a bhfuil cumais choibhéiseacha agus riachtanais chomhchosúla acu i dtimpeallacht le hacmhainní teoranta. Deir sé an nasc seo thar barr amach: "má tá an rud céanna ag teastáil ó bheirt fhear, rud nach féidir leo beirt taitneamh a bhaint as, éiríonn siad ina naimhde" agus dá bhrí sin, i staid an chogaidh lena chéile (Pobs 75). Ach ós rud é go bhfuil go leor cumais agus riachtanais den chineál céanna ag daoine, léiríonn an comórtas seo ní amháin sna hidirghníomhaíochtaí aonair ach freisin ar leibhéal na daonnachta ina iomláine. Chomh fada agus a bhfuil cearta comhionanna agus neamhtheoranta ag gach duine ar gach acmhainn agus fiú ar chomhlachtaí agus ar shaol a chéile, is éard atá i staid an nádúir ná cogadh de "gach fear in aghaidh gach fear" (obbes 76). Tagann an léiriú grim seo go díreach ó léiriú Caitheamh aimsire ar staid an dúlra mar a rialaíonn na daoine aonair amháin.<br/><br/>Ar an láimh eile, déanann Locke difríochtaí idir staid an dúlra agus staid an chogaidh agus tugann sé le fios gurb amhlaidh, cé go dtarlaíonn siad ag an am céanna, ní cúis ar bith chun duine a aithint leis an duine eile. Tá sainmhíniú Locke ar an staid cogaidh beagnach comhionann leis sin a thairgeann Hobbs. Dar le Locke, "Déanann sé siúd a dhéanann iarracht fear eile a chur ina chumhacht iomlán é féin isteach i gcogadh leis" (14). Tá an míniú seo ar bun go foirfe leis an gcoincheap Caitheamh aimsire go bhfuil ceart uilíoch ag gach duine ar gach rud, lena n-áirítear comhlachtaí agus saol na ndaoine eile, go dtiocfaidh an cogadh chun cinn. Ach diúltaíonn Locke staid an chogaidh agus an dúlra a chothromú go beacht toisc go ndiúltaíonn sé léiriú Caitheamh aimsire ar an tsaoirse nádúrtha. Ós rud é go gcuireann stát nádúrtha Locke srian ar dhaoine díobháil a dhéanamh dá chéile tríd an dara teorainn leis an tsaoirse, is ionann iarracht ar shaoirse duine eile agus an dlí nádúrtha. Cé gur le haghaidh Caitheamh aimsire, is é cogadh riocht an duine de réir réamhshocraithe, léiríonn Locke é mar perversion ar staid an dúlra seachas ar a riail.<br/><br/>Na difríochtaí seo maidir leis an staid sa nádúr agus a comhdhamhnaí a shainiú, amhail saoirse, comhionannas, ceartas agus cogadh, réitigh an bealach a réiteach do na húdair a thugann aghaidh ar thairseacha rialtais. Bunaithe ar a mheasúnú seadaíoch ar an staid an nádúir, críochnaíonn údar Leviathan nach féidir, faoi choinníollacha cogaidh, a bheith ann dóchas cinnte a bheith ann "an t-am a chuireann nádúr ar chumas fir maireachtáil" (Hobs 80). Tá an réiteach ag leagan síos an ceart uilíoch do gach duine agus ag fágáil "an oiread sin saoirse i gcoinne fir eile, mar go ligfeadh sé d'fhir eile ina choinne" (Hobs 80). Déanann rannpháirtithe an chonartha sóisialta mar thoradh air sin infheistíocht ar na saoirsí neamhtheoranta a thug siad ina gceannas - iompróir na cumhachta uachtaracha a bhfuil sé mar aidhm acu an stádas bainte amach a chaomhnú trí gach trasnuithe ina choinne a phionósú. Is cumhacht iomlán é cumhacht na Seigne: tá an t-údarás ag an rialóir "a dhéanamh cibé rud is dóigh leis is gá" chun an tsíocháin a chur chun cinn idir a chuid ábhar ionas nach dtiocfadh aon duine le saol ná le maoin duine eile (113). Is é conclúid caitheamh aimsire nach féidir le duine ar bith, gan a leithéid de fhigiúr neamh-inúsáidte, a bhfuil sé de cheart aige aon rud a dhéanamh leis na hábhair, ní féidir aon tsíocháin ná aon ráthaíocht slándála.<br/><br/>Cé go n-aontaíonn Locke leis an ngá atá le sochaí eagraithe go polaitiúil a chruthú, cuireann sé i gcoinne smaoineamh Caitheamh aimsire ar an gcumhacht cheannasaigh mar dhaoine neamhtheoranta agus neamh-incheadaithe. Mar a luadh thuas, níl staid Locke beagnach chomh dian sin mar a phéinteáil Caitheamh aimsire mar gheall ar oibleagáid na ndaoine iad féin a chaomhnú ach ar a chéile freisin. Dá bhrí sin, tagann an gá atá le conradh sóisialta ní ó eagla na daoine eile, ach ón áisiúlacht fórsa. Ní fhéadfaidh go leor dlíthe a bheith ag teastáil ó phobail bheaga chun coinbhleachtaí a réiteach agus "oifigigh chun tacú leis an bpróiseas", ach cuireann comhlachais níos mó ar fáil iad chun rialtais a chur ar bun chun na críche sin (Lock 57). Ach ní féidir cumhacht an rialtais a bheith gan teorainn toisc go dtiocfadh leis na daoine is ábhar a chur faoi réir "dochar leanúnach, neamhchinnte, anaithnid, treallach fear eile" (Lock 17). Trí chomhaontú a dhéanamh le cumhacht iomlán duine eile thar a shaol, dhéanfadh ábhar sárú ar a chéad teorannú ar thoirmeasc dochar a dhéanamh dó féin. Maidir leis an rialtóir, is dochar díreach é saoirse duine eile a scriosadh agus, dá bhrí sin, bheadh sé contrártha leis an dara teorainn.<br/><br/>Mar leanúint díreach dá chás d’údarás rialtais neamhtheoranta, shéan Hobbs scaradh cumhachtaí mar phrionsabal. Ón dearcadh a bhí aige, tá “an chumhacht iomlán chun na rialacha a fhorordú” ag an gceannas, a rialaíonn saol na n-ábhar nó, i dtéarmaí níos giorra, an chumhacht reachtach (Tobes 114). Tá sé de cheart ag an gceannas freisin "éisteacht agus cinneadh a dhéanamh ar gach chonspóid" – is é sin, an chumhacht breithiúnach (Pobs 114). Mar fhocal scoir, ós rud é gurb é cuspóir iomlán an gceannas ná na hábhair a chur i bhfeidhm chun staonadh ó dhochar a dhéanamh dá chéile, ní féidir aon amhras a bheith ann gurb é an chumhacht feidhmiúcháin a shainchumais eisiach freisin. Tá scaradh cumhachtaí mar choincheap coimhthíoch do caitheamh aimsire mar gheall ar a thuairimí ar staid an dúlra. Aonán polaitiúil a chruthú ina ndéanfadh na craobhacha feidhmiúcháin, reachtacha agus breithiúnacha seiceáil ar a chéile – is é sin, a bheadh san iomaíocht – a d’fhágfadh go mbeadh sé mar bhonn agus mar chogadh níos airde ag daoine sa lá atá inniu ann. Ós rud é go dtéann na daoine isteach i gconradh sóisialta agus go gcuireann siad rialtas chun an staid dúlra a chur taobh thiar dóibh, ní fhéadfaidh siad é a athbhunú i bhfoirm dhifriúil, agus cumhachtaí a scaradh go díreach le tuairimí Caitheamh aimsire.<br/><br/>Ar an láimh eile, glacann sé le scaradh cumhachta mar phrionsabal bunúsach a theoiric pholaitiúil. Is léir a chás don idirscaradh agus é ag plé teorainneacha an chumhachta reachtaigh. Mar a chuireann Locke é, bheadh sé inmholta ar éigean "do na daoine céanna, a bhfuil an chumhacht acu dlíthe a dhéanamh, an chumhacht a bheith acu ina lámha freisin iad a fhorghníomhú" (76). Léiríonn an fealsamh na neamhfhoirfeachtaí a bhaineann le nádúr an duine agus an fonn bunúsach a "grasp ar chumhacht" mar réasúnaíocht don bheart réamhchúraim seo (Locke 76). Díreach mar atá i gcás Caitheamh aimsire, cuntas Locke ar scaradh na gcumhachtaí go díreach óna léiriú ar staid an dúlra. Má tá ceartas ann cheana féin i staid an dúlra agus más féidir leis na daoine é a thuiscint, níl aon rialtas faoi réir an dlí nádúrtha chéanna. Ós rud é go sáraíonn cumhacht iomlán os cionn daoine teorainneacha an dlí seo, moltar é a scaradh agus a dháileadh ionas go bhfeidhmeodh an rialtas go cuí.<br/><br/>Léirigh an páipéar seo, cé go bhfuil na difríochtaí idir cuntais Caitheamh aimsire agus Loch an stáit nádúrtha na daonnachta iomadúla, is ionann iad sa deireadh agus easpa áitreabh morálta. Breathnaíonn caitheamh aimsire ar an staid nádúrtha mar shaoirse gan teorainn, áit a bhfuil daoine a bhfuil cumais chomhionann acu agus nach bhfuil faoi cheangal ag aon nóisean morálta, amhail an ceartas, san iomaíocht do na hacmhainní gan staonadh. Mar sin féin, déanann sé an comhionannas agus an tsaoirse a léirmhíniú go heiticiúil seachas go praiticiúil agus osclaíonn sé gur perversion an stáit nádúrtha é an cogadh, toisc go gcuireann an dlí nádúrtha iallach ar dhaoine dochar a dhéanamh dá chéile. Bíonn tionchar ag an easaontas seo ar chur chuige na bhFealsúnach don rialtas. Áitíonn caitheamh aimsire ar rialtóir uile-chumhachtach, mar, in éagmais srianta eiticiúla, ní fhéadfadh aon údarás eile iallach a chur ar an duine díobháil a dhéanamh dá chéile. Mar sin féin, i bhfianaise Locke, bheadh cumhachtaí neamhtheoranta an rialtais á ndeonú contrártha do na teorainneacha eiticiúla atá leabaithe i ndlí an dúlra, agus is é sin an fáth, murab ionann agus Caitheamh aimsire, a mholann scaradh cumhachtaí. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Stíl Mhaireachtála: Cad iad na Cluiche na Gcathaoireacha chaith suas<br/><br/>Chuir an t-amhránaí Ceanada-Fraincis Abba Hasan iarracht dalling chun achoimre a dhéanamh ar gach duine den chine daonna ag Faisean Paradise 2014.

| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil....

Mar shampla, sreabhadh insíothlú, galú agus uisce laistigh den ithir. Mar fheiniméan forleathan san ithir, athraíonn athshlánú uisce ithreach na feidhmeanna hiodrálacha ithreach trí shreabhadh uisce a chur in aghaidh na hithreach. Thairis sin, tá na hairíonna hiodrálacha ag brath ní hamháin ar an gcóras pore na hithreach ach freisin a bhfuil tionchar ag airíonna síciceimiceacha na dromchlaí pore.I gcomparáid le huisce, ní bhíonn tionchar ag an t-aiteán ar an uisce mar gheall ar a teannas dromchla níos ísle. Is é an cuspóir a bhaineann le heatánól a úsáid ná deireadh a chur leis an éifeacht atá ag freagairt ar uisce ithreach maidir le tomhais ar airíonna hiodrálacha. Mar sin féin, is féidir le heatán íon a chur i bhfeidhm san ithir nádúrtha na hábhair orgánacha ithreach a dhíghrádú agus athruithe ar airíonna fisiceacha a bheith mar thoradh orthu. Dá bhrí sin, is féidir leis na réitigh eatán uiscí a bheith ina rogha malartach.Mar sin féin, ní fios an fhéidearthacht go n-úsáidtear eatán dubhach chun cuar coinneála leachtach ithreach a chinneadh. Is é is aidhm don staidéar seo tástáil a dhéanamh ar indéantacht na tuaslagáin uisciúla (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % agus 100 % v/v) chun cuar coinneála le haghaidh leacht a bhunú faoi raon beag de bhrú i samplaí gaineamh garbha le fliuchais éagsúla agus ithir nádúrtha leasaithe orgánacha (TSL) le múirín beacán, bithcharr, eisilteach déiríochta agus comp bardasach, ba é 15 % de réir meáchain an ráta iarratais). Léirigh an toradh go raibh ionsú na réitigh teolaí uiscí i gcomparáid le huisce níos tapúla ag thart ar 1 go 3x bunaithe ar an ábhar leachtach ag an mbrú i bhfeidhm céanna agus an t-am chun gach equirium a bhaint amach. Thug na torthaí ón turgnamh gainimh le fios nuair a bhí tiúchan an tuaslagán uisce faoi bhun 50 %, go raibh na caillteanais trí ghalú níos lú ná 1% agus go raibh na difríochtaí coibhneasta idir leacht tástála agus uisce níos ísle ná 10 %. Mar sin féin, ba iad na caillteanais galraithe 11.06 % agus 24.6 %, agus bhí na difríochtaí coibhneasta cothrom le thart ar 15 % agus 30 % i réiteach iomlán 50 % agus 100 %, faoi seach. I gcodarsnacht leis sin, níor mhéadaigh na leasuithe orgánacha i Templeton an cumas faoi choinneáil uisce ach laghdaíodh na caillteanais galúcháin freisin.
