| Cyrus the Great<br/><br/>1669 Words7 Pages<br/><br/>Cyrus the Great Builds the Persian Empire by Governing With Toleration and Kindness<br/><br/>The greatest leaders in history often leave behind some sort of legacy. Cyrus the Great was the founder of the Persian Empire around 500 B.C., which was the largest empire of its time (Cyrus II, the Great). The empire stretched from ancient Iran, and grew to include an area reaching from Greece to India (Persian Empire). Cyrus' reign saw some of the first contacts between Persia and Greece, and helped Persia gain the political power that had once been held by the people of Mesopotamia (Cyrus, the Great). Cyrus the Great proved to be an effective leader who developed a strong military that was stationed strategically throughout the empire to stop…show more content…<br/><br/>Persia took over the Medes' kingdom, thus beginning the rise in power of the Persian Empire. Cyrus established a new capital at Pasargadae to commemorate his victory (Cyrus II, the Great). Cyrus was very ambitious, so he continued to work on increasing his empire. In 547 B.C. he went to war against the wealthy King Croesus of Lydia and defeated him at the Battle of Ptyerum. He went on to capture the Greek city states along the coast of Anatolia. At this point Cyrus' empire was 3,000 miles wide, but Cyrus was most interested in capturing Babylon because of the power and importance it represented. In 540 B.C., Cyrus set his sights on Babylon, which had been his ally up to that time. The people of Babylon were unhappy with King Nabonidus because he did not honor the God Marduk (Pettman). Without warning, the King left for Arabia, and in his ten-year absence left his son Belshazzar in charge. King Nabonidus eventually returned to Babylon in 543 B.C. and brought all of the gods from the surrounding area into Babylon. Then, in the spring of 539 B.C., he tried to win back his people's favor by celebrating the New Year's rite, but failed to do so (Cyrus II, The Great). The people of Babylon were ready for a new ruler. The Persians finally attacked while Babylon was celebrating a festival that was known for its'<br/><br/>most important women in history. Her name was Queen Tomyris of the Massagetea. She stood in the way of the conquests of Cyrus the Great. She lost her son to Cyrus in the war. Despite that, she challenged him to another fight to keep her kingdom free. She got vengeance for her son and protected Greece from capture by Cyrus. In doing this she shaped the known world.<br/>Cyrus the Great was the founder of the Persian Empire who lived around 350 BC.

This essay will be four paragraphs which will state his early life, genealogy and rise to the throne, his adult life and many conquests, his later years, families, death and his lasting legacy.<br/>King Cyrus was born in c. 575 B.C. He was the son of a Persian king called Cambyses and his wife Mandane…<br/><br/>a number of Persian Empires, but none of them can compare to the great Achaemenid Empire, which ruled between 550 to 330BC. The Achaemenid Empire is known as the largest empire in Ancient history which stretched out approximately 8 million km² at the height of its power. So how does an Empire so large and with such great power collapse? Was it struggle for power, which every new king had to suffer after the death of Darius the Great? Or was it because of corruption of the ministers and Satraps that…<br/><br/>Nebuchadrezzar, deported most of the population to other cities, including Babylon. These exiles remained there for about fifty years until the Persian forces, under king Cyrus, took the city of Babylon in 539 BC. The Persian policies concerning captured and exiled peoples were quite different than those of the Babylonians, and because of this King Cyrus allowed the exiles to return to Jerusalem in 538 BC to rebuild the city and the Temple.<br/>However, even though the exiles were allowed to return to their ancestral…<br/><br/>entire book of Isaiah was written by Isaiah, the son of Amoz." Nevertheless, the genuineness of Isaiah being the work of one author has been "keenly opposed by able critics." The issue rests on the fact that Isaiah prophesied about the reign of Cyrus, which occurred over 150 years after his prophesy. These critics felt there must have been "a deutero-Isaiah," who composed part of Isaiah toward the end of the Babylonian captivity. This issue of multiple authorship of Isaiah "depends heavily" on…<br/><br/>Cyrus the Great, or 'Kourosh-e-Bozorg' in Persian, was the founder of the Archaemenid Empire (also known as the Persian Empire). Within his 29 years of Kingship, he had managed to create a legacy that lasts to this day through his military campaigns against several empires, conquering the lands from present day Turkey to India, and ruling with religious tolerance.

Ba é Cíora Mhór bunaitheoir na hImpireachta Peirinsigh timpeall 500 B.C., an Impireacht ba mhó dá chuid ama (Cyrus II, an Great). Stiúir an Impireacht ón Iaráin ársa, agus d’fhás sé chun áit a bhaint amach ón nGréig go dtí an India (Impireacht na Stát Aontaithe). Ba é réimeas Cyrus cuid de na chéad teagmháil idir Persia agus an Ghréig, agus chuidigh sé le Persia an chumhacht pholaitiúil a bhí i seilbh mhuintir Mesopotamia a fháil uair amháin (an Cyrus, an Great). Cíora an Great a bhí ina cheannaire éifeachtach a d'fhorbair míleata láidir a bhí luaite go straitéiseach ar fud na impireacht chun stop a chur...<br/><br/>Ar an gcaoi sin, chuir Persia tús le ríocht na Medes, agus chuir siad tús le méadú ar chumhacht Impireacht na Peirsis. Bhunaigh Cíora Cíd caipiteal nua i bParagáid chun comóradh a dhéanamh ar a bhua (Cyrus II, an Great). Bhí Cíoras an-uaillmhianach, agus mar sin lean sé ar aghaidh ag obair ar a impireacht a mhéadú. I 547 R.C. chuaigh sé chun cogaidh i gcoinne Chroiseas saibhir Rí Lydia agus rinne sé é a ruaigeadh ag Cath Pyterum. Chuaigh sé ar aghaidh chun stát cathrach na Gréige a ghabháil feadh chósta na Anatolia.Ag an bpointe seo bhí Impireacht Chíora 3,000 míle ar leithead, ach ba é Cíora an rud is mó a raibh suim aige i mBablóin a ghabháil mar gheall ar an gcumhacht agus an tábhacht a léirigh sé. I 540 RC, chuir Cíora a radharcanna ar an mBablóin, rud a bhí chomh hard leis an am sin. Bhí muintir na Bablóine míshásta leis an Rí Nabnóide mar níor thug sé onóir don Dia Marduk (Pettman). D’fhág an Rí a mhac Belsazzar i gceannas gan rabhadh a thabhairt, agus ina éagmais deich mbliana, d’fhill an Rí Nabonidus ar an mBablóin i 543 B.C. ar deireadh thiar agus thug sé na déithe go léir ón gceantar máguaird isteach sa Bhablóin. Ansin, in earrach 539 B.C., rinne sé iarracht an fhabhar a bhí ag a mhuintir a bhuachan ar ais trí chriathar na Bliana Nua a cheiliúradh, ach theip orthu é sin a dhéanamh (Cyrus II, The Great) bhí muintir na Bablóine réidh le haghaidh rialóir nua.

Bhí beartais na Peirsis a bhain le pobail a gabhadh agus a deoraíocht difriúil go leor ná muintir na Bablóine, agus mar gheall ar seo thug an Rí Cíoras cead do na deoraíochtacha filleadh ar Iarúsailéim i 538 RC chun an chathair agus an Teampaill a atógáil.<br/>Mar sin féin, cé go raibh cead ag na deoraíocht filleadh ar a sinsear...<br/><br/>leabhair Íseáia a scríobh Íseáia, mac Amoz."

The answer may be no. How can we retool education to prepare them with the lifelong skills to navigate and thrive in an uncertain future? "We need to empower the next generation of students by providing the resources, mentorship and skills training to maximise previously untapped talent," says Bian Li, an international entrepreneurship expert. "Entrepreneurship as livelihood is to empower next generation of students to fulfil their economic potential and create their own opportunities. Entrepreneurship as economic development is to cultivate next generation of entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses to create jobs, spur innovation and solve critical problems," said Li, while speaking on 'Seed to sustainability - future-proofing Indian youth for the next 100 Years," at a seminar held at the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) here city on Tuesday. Bian Li, who is also the founder of The Hungry Lab, said, "Never before has there been such a sense of urgency to prepare society to adapt to a volatile tomorrow, with growing anxiety about being left behind. The Hungry Lab is a holistic and decentralised platform future-proofing today's youth and workforce. Our mission is to lay the educational, entrepreneurial and ecosystem foundations for a future where anyone who is hungry to shape the world has the capacity, opportunity and resources to do so." The Hungry Lab empowers individuals, teams and organisations with the mindset, tools and nurturing ecosystems to build a more resilient future and stake their claim in a rapidly changing world.<br/><br/>The lecture also kick-started an important collaboration between the MSSRF and The Hungry Lab and launched the 100 challenges with 100 solutions to 100 youth entrepreneurs for advancing India into the next 100 years. M S Swaminathan, founder of MSSRF who chaired the discussion, appreciated Li for her innovative thoughts and said that applying those models and ideas that was shared in the seminar in practicality is more important. | Pléann imeacht i gCenani bealaí chun an chéad ghlúin eile de scoláirí a chumhachtú<br/><br/>Pléann imeacht i gCenani bealaí chun an chéad ghlúin eile de scoláirí a chumhachtú<br/><br/>TNN &#124; Nuashonraithe: 15 Bealtaine, 2019 10:22 SI<br/><br/>AN tACHTACH: An ullmhaíonn an scolaíocht thraidisiúnta ár n-óige chun dul in oiriúint agus chun cinn a dhéanamh i ndomhan luaineachta?Ní féidir leis an bhfreagra a bheith ann. Conas is féidir linn oideachas a athbhunú chun iad a ullmhú leis na scileanna ar feadh an tsaoil chun nascleanúint agus rathú i dtodhchaí éiginnte? Ní mór dúinn cumhacht a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile de scoláirí trí na hacmhainní, an meantóireacht agus an oiliúint scileanna a sholáthar chun tallann gan choinne a uasmhéadú," a deir Brian Li, saineolaí fiontraíochta idirnáisiúnta. Is éard atá i gceist le “fiontraíocht mar shlí bheatha ná an chéad ghlúin eile de mhic léinn a chumasú chun a n-acmhainneacht eacnamaíoch a chomhlíonadh agus a ndeiseanna féin a chruthú. Is éard atá i gceist le fiontraíocht mar fhorbairt eacnamaíoch ná an chéad ghlúin eile d’fhiontraithe a chothú chun poist inbhuanaithe a chruthú, nuálaíocht a spreagadh agus fadhbanna criticiúla a réiteach," a dúirt Li, agus í ag labhairt ar ‘Sed to inbhuanaitheacht – óige Indiach a chur chun cinn don todhchaí ar feadh 100 Bliain atá amach romhainn,’ ag seimineár a reáchtáladh ag Fondúireacht Taighde MS Swaminhan (MSRF) anseo ar an Máirt. Dúirt Brian Li, atá ina bhunaitheoir ar The Hungry Lab freisin, "Ní raibh a leithéid de bhéargais ann riamh chun sochaí a ullmhú chun dul in oiriúint don amárach so-ghalaithe, agus imní ag fás faoi a bheith fágtha taobh thiar. Is ardán iomlánaíoch agus díláraithe é The Hungry Lab atá ina óige agus ina lucht saothair sa lá atá inniu ann. Is é ár misean a leagan síos na fondúireachtaí oideachais, fiontraíochta agus éiceachórais do thodhchaí ina bhfuil sé de chumas ag aon duine a bhfuil ocras air an domhan a mhúnlú é sin a dhéanamh." Tugann Saotharlann na Oirbheartaíochta cumhacht do dhaoine aonair, d’fhoirne agus d’eagraíochtaí leis an meon, na huirlisí agus na héiceachórais a chothú chun todhchaí níos athléimní a thógáil agus a n-éileamh a ghlacadh i ndomhan atá ag athrú go gasta.<br/><br/>Chomh maith leis sin, chuir an léacht tús le comhoibriú tábhachtach idir an MSRF agus The Hungry Lab agus sheol siad an 100 dúshlán agus 100 réiteach ar 100 fiontraí óige chun an India a chur chun cinn sna 100 bliain amach romhainn. Bhí an-mheas ag M Swaminathan, bunaitheoir MSSRRF a rinne cathaoirleacht ar an bplé, ar Li as a smaointe nuálacha agus dúirt sé go bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí na samhlacha agus na smaointe sin a roinneadh sa seimineár i gcleachtas. |

| HR Articles and Insights from Industry Experts<br/><br/>CareersOver 25 percent of Americans are now participating in the new "gig economy," in which they work part-time or contracted positions, instead of dedicated full-time positions. However, a new study warns that the gig economy could be destructive for Americans' health and well-being.<br/><br/>Rob Wilson, employment trends expert and President of Employco USA, says, "The research shows that a gig economy leaves most part-time workers without health care, retirement funding, dental care, or disability benefits. Meanwhile, many of these 'giggers' often have to work more than one job in order to make ends meet, and this is particularly increasing among female workers."<br/><br/>In fact, Wilson says that holding multiple part-time jobs can actually be destructive to a woman's earning potential, saying, "One study showed that women who held a number of part-time jobs in their 20s saw absolutely no increase in earnings in their 30s, meaning that even as their experience and their families' needs grow, they do not earn a dollar more."<br/><br/>The gig economy can also be destructive to a worker's physical health. "An Italian study found that contract workers are more likely to suffer from depression and require prescription anti-depressants," says Wilson. "Which is ironic considering these workers often don't have health insurance which makes this medication extremely cost-prohibitive."<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wilson says that these workers are offered very little protection under the law, which has led to many gig employees complaining about inhumane work environments and harassment. "Those who work for companies like Uber don't have much in the way of legal protection, nor do they have any certainty of their earning potential even a few months into the future. It's clear that the gig economy is not kind to workers on many levels, which is why the focus right now needs to be on creating permanent full-time positions for employees of all ages. While it is possible to make a lucrative living solely off freelance work, the reality is that it comes at a cost, and not many Americans are prepared to pay the price."<br/><br/>A recent survey from the American Staffing Association found that most Americans have little faith that they can find a better job than the one they currently have. As for unemployed Americans, hope is equally dim as 38 percent of able-bodied workers say that they do not believe they can find a job in the coming year.<br/><br/>CEO of Employco USA and employment expert Rob Wilson says, "According to the old adage, there is no job harder than trying to find a job, and that can be true even if you are already gainfully employed. Many Americans are miserable in their current positions, but they don't want to waste their precious time off looking for another job if they have little hope their hard work will pay off."<br/><br/>Wilson believes part of the problem is that the job search is so terrifying to many people. "Looking for a job can make you incredibly vulnerable," he says, "Even a confident person can become depleted after a slew of unsuccessful interviews."<br/><br/>His advice? Work smarter, not harder.<br/><br/>"If you use an employment agency, you can immediately tap into a world of connections and possibilities that would not otherwise be available to you," says Wilson, "And these experts can be invaluable in helping you improve your resume and interview skills."<br/><br/>Wilson also believes a shotgun approach isn't the best way to go. "Don't waste your time applying to 50 jobs just so you can feel accomplished," he says, "Chances are most of those jobs aren't a good fit for you, so all you have done is waste your time and the employer's time. Instead, hone in on jobs that are specific to your skills and interests. It's better to apply to one job a week rather than 50, if that one job could actually open doors for you."<br/><br/>Lastly, Wilson thinks practice makes perfect. "There is no such thing as a wasted interview. Every interaction gives you a chance to fine-tune your skills and improve your communication."<br/><br/>For more on Wilson's job hunting tips or to speak to him further, please contact me.<br/><br/>Recent statistics show that this is the best job market for graduates in the past decade. However, these graduates also carry more college debt than any other generation before them. Never before has it been more important for young people to find work and start making money as soon as possible.<br/><br/>"College debt can be astronomical," says employment expert Rob Wilson, CEO of Employco USA, "The weight of this can often pressure new graduates to take any job they can find and start working right away. However, that might not be the best plan of action. It is better to be purposeful and discerning in your job search. Remember, you are building the foundation for a career, not just trying to get a paycheck."<br/><br/>Here are Wilson's top tips for how graduates can land a dream job:<br/><br/>1) Don't be lured by a big paycheck. "Money isn't everything, even if you do have debt looming down on you," says Wilson, "It is better to take a job with a smaller paycheck that is in the field you actually desire than to take a job with a large paycheck that has nothing to do with your long-term career goals."<br/><br/>2) Live at home if you have to. "I know most college graduates want nothing more than to break away and have their own place, but the reality is that an unpaid internship isn't going to help you get that big city apartment. But that doesn't mean that the internship isn't the right choice. Working as an unpaid intern can be stressful, but it can be a very wise move and help you build lifelong connections that will serve you throughout your career."<br/><br/>3) Make Google work for you. "Everyone knows that an employer is going to Google your name before they decide if they want to hire you," says Wilson, "So make sure that your internet presence is going to be impressive. Have a personal website or create an online portfolio that features your work. Have a Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn account that reflects drive, intelligence and professionalism. Don't be afraid to show your personality a little bit, but remember: This is about your career, not tweeting about the Kardashians."<br/><br/>4) Keep attending school. "I know most graduates never want to return to a classroom, but nothing is more impressive to a prospective employer than an applicant who has continuing education credits in their field or someone who attends seminars in their field of interest. Keep learning, even after you have a diploma in your hand."<br/><br/>5) Consider temp work. "Temporary work can be a great way to keep your resume padded and your bank account full," says Wilson. "Employers hate to see big blank spots on an applicant's resume, so prove that you are hard-working even when you haven't found a full-time permanent position yet. Plus, temping can be a great way to make connections, build experience, and learn more about what it is like to work in a professional environment." | Acmhainní Daonna agus Saighdeanna ó Shaineolaithe Tionscail<br/><br/>Tá níos mó ná 25 faoin gcéad de na Meiriceánaigh ag glacadh páirte sa "giggheilleagar" nua anois, ina n-oibríonn siad post páirtaimseartha nó conradh, in ionad poist thiomnaithe lánaimseartha. Tugann staidéar nua, áfach, foláireamh go bhféadfadh an geilleagar gig a bheith millteach do shláinte agus d’fholláine na Meiriceánaigh.<br/><br/>Deir Rob Wilson, saineolaí ar threochtaí fostaíochta agus Uachtarán Employco USA, "Léiríonn an taighde go bhfágann geilleagar gig an chuid is mó d’oibrithe páirtaimseartha gan cúram sláinte, maoiniú scoir, cúram fiaclóireachta, nó sochair míchumais. Idir an dá linn, is minic a chaithfidh go leor de na ‘móradóirí’ seo a bheith ag obair níos mó ná post amháin chun deireadh a chur le chéile, agus tá sé seo ag méadú go háirithe i measc oibrithe baineann’.<br/><br/>Go deimhin, deir Wilson gur féidir le poist lánaimseartha iolracha a bheith millteach i ndáiríre d’acmhainn tuillimh na mban, ag rá, “Léiríonn staidéar amháin nach bhfaca mná a raibh roinnt post páirtaimseartha ina 20idí go hiomlán aon mhéadú ar thuilleamh ina 30idí, rud a chiallaíonn nach bhfásann siad fiú de réir mar a bhíonn taithí acu agus a riachtanais teaghlaigh, ní thuilleann siad dollar níos mó.”<br/><br/>Is féidir leis an ngeilleagar gig a bheith millteach do shláinte fhisiceach an oibrí freisin. "Taimsigh staidéar na hIodáile gur dóichí go mbeidh oibrithe conartha ag fulaingt ó dúlagar agus go n-éilíonn sé frith-díoirí ar oideas," a deir Wilson. "Cé acu is iarnáil ag smaoineamh go minic nach bhfuil árachas sláinte a dhéanann an cógas seo thar a bheith costasach".<br/><br/>Ina theannta sin, deir Wilson nach gcuirtear mórán cosanta ar fáil do na hoibrithe seo faoin dlí, rud a d’fhág go raibh go leor fostaithe gig ag gearán faoi thimpeallachtaí oibre mídhaonna agus ciapadh. Níl mórán cosanta dlí ag na daoine a oibríonn do chuideachtaí cosúil le Uber, ná níl aon chinnteacht acu dá gcumas tuillimh fiú cúpla mí amach anseo. Is léir nach bhfuil an geilleagar gig cineálta d’oibrithe ar go leor leibhéil, agus is é sin an fáth go gcaithfidh an fócas ceart anois a bheith ar phoist lánaimseartha buan a chruthú d’fhostaithe de gach aois. Cé gur féidir obair shaorálach a dhéanamh, is é an réaltacht go dtagann sé ar chostas, agus nach bhfuil go leor Meiriceánaigh sásta an praghas a íoc."<br/><br/>Fuair suirbhé le déanaí ón gCumann Tacaíochta Meiriceánach go bhfuil creideamh beag ag an gcuid is mó de na Meiriceánaigh gur féidir leo post níos fearr a fháil ná an duine atá acu faoi láthair. Maidir le Meiriceánaigh dífhostaithe, tá dóchas chomh dona céanna mar a deir 38 faoin gcéad d’oibrithe fuilithe nach gcreideann siad gur féidir leo post a fháil sa bhliain amach romhainn.<br/><br/>Deir Príomhfheidhmeannach Employco USA agus saineolaí fostaíochta Rob Wilson, "De réir an tseanaoise, níl aon phost níos deacra ná iarracht a dhéanamh post a fháil, agus is féidir é sin a bheith fíor fiú má tá tú fostaithe go sochrach cheana féin. Tá go leor Meiriceánach olc ina bpoist reatha, ach níl siad ag iarraidh a gcuid ama luachmhar a chur amú ag lorg poist eile mura bhfuil mórán dóchais acu go n-íocfaidh siad a gcuid oibre crua."<br/><br/>Creideann Wilson go bhfuil an cuardach poist chomh corraitheach do go leor daoine. "Is féidir le post a dhéanamh leat thar a bheith leochaileach", a deir sé, "Is féidir fiú duine muiníneach a scriosadh tar éis cúpla agallamh nár éirigh leis."<br/><br/>A chomhairle? Obair níos cliste, ní níos deacra.<br/><br/>"Má úsáideann tú gníomhaireacht fostaíochta, is féidir leat leas a bhaint as láithreach i saol na nasc agus na féidearthachtaí nach mbeadh ar fáil duit murach sin," a deir Wilson, "Agus is féidir leis na saineolaithe seo a bheith luachmhar chun cabhrú leat do chuid scileanna atosúa agus agallaimh a fheabhsú."<br/><br/>Wilson creideann chomh maith nach bhfuil cur chuige gunna gráin an bealach is fearr chun dul. "Ná dramhaíola do chuid ama a bhaineann le 50 post díreach mar sin is féidir leat a bheith i gcrích," a deir sé, "Tá seans nach bhfuil an chuid is mó de na poist sin oiriúnach go maith duit, mar sin níl gach rud atá déanta agat ná dramhaíl do chuid ama agus am an fhostóra. Ina áit sin, téigh isteach ar phoist atá sonrach do do scileanna agus do leasanna.Is fearr iarratas a dhéanamh ar phost amháin in aghaidh na seachtaine seachas 50, dá bhféadfadh post amháin sin doirse a oscailt duit i ndáiríre."<br/><br/>Ar deireadh, smaoiníonn Wilson ar chleachtas foirfe. "Níl aon rud den sórt sin mar agallamh dramhaíola.Tugann gach idirghníomhaíocht seans duit do scileanna a mhionchoigeartú agus do chumarsáid a fheabhsú."<br/><br/>Le haghaidh tuilleadh eolais a fháil ar leideanna fiaigh poist Wilson nó labhairt leis a thuilleadh, téigh i dteagmháil liom le do thoil.<br/><br/>Taispeánann staitisticí le déanaí gurb é seo an margadh poist is fearr do chéimithe le deich mbliana anuas. Mar sin féin, tá níos mó fiacha ag na céimithe seo ná aon ghlúin eile os a gcomhair. Ní raibh sé níos tábhachtaí riamh go bhfaigheadh daoine óga obair agus tús a chur le hairgead a dhéanamh chomh luath agus is féidir.<br/><br/>Deir "Is féidir le fiachas an Choláiste a bheith réalteolaíoch," saineolaí fostaíochta Rob Wilson, POF Employco USA, "Is minic gur féidir le meáchan an phoist seo a bhrú chun aon phost a aimsiú agus tosú ag obair láithreach. Mar sin féin, b’fhéidir nach é sin an plean gníomhaíochta is fearr. Tá sé níos fearr a bheith cuspóirach agus géarchúiseach i do chuardach poist. Cuimhnigh, tá tú ag tógáil na bunús le haghaidh gairme, ní hamháin ag iarraidh a fháil paycheck."<br/><br/>Seo iad na leideanna is fearr atá ag Wilson maidir leis an gcaoi ar féidir le céimithe post aisling a fháil:<br/><br/>1) Ná bí lured ag íocaíocht mhór. "Airgead nach bhfuil gach rud, fiú má dhéanann tú go bhfuil fiach looming síos ar tú," a deir Wilson, "Is fearr post a ghlacadh le íocaíocht níos lú go bhfuil sa réimse mian leat i ndáiríre ná post a ghlacadh le pá-sheiceáil mór go bhfuil aon rud a dhéanamh le do spriocanna gairme fadtéarmach."<br/><br/>2) Tá cónaí sa bhaile má tá tú a. "Tá a fhios agam an chuid is mó coláiste céimithe ag iarraidh rud ar bith níos mó ná a bhriseadh ar shiúl agus a bhfuil a n-áit féin, ach is é an réaltacht nach bhfuil intéirneacht gan phá ag dul chun cabhrú leat a fháil go árasán chathair mhór. Ach ní chiallaíonn sé sin nach é an intéirneacht an rogha ceart.Is féidir le hobair mar intéirneach gan phá a bheith strusmhar, ach is féidir leis a bheith ina bhogadh an-ciallmhar agus cabhrú leat naisc ar feadh an tsaoil a thógáil a fhreastalóidh ort ar fud do shlí bheatha."<br/><br/>3) Déan obair Google ar do shon "Tá a fhios ag gach duine go bhfuil fostóir ag dul go dtí Google d'ainm sula gcinneann siad más mian leo a fháil ar cíos tú," a deir Wilson, "Mar sin déan cinnte go mbeidh do láithreacht idirlín go hiontach. Bíodh suíomh Gréasáin pearsanta agat nó cruthaigh punann ar líne ina bhfuil do chuid oibre. Bíodh cuntas Twitter, Facebook, agus LinkedIn agat a léiríonn tiomáint, faisnéis agus gairmiúlacht. Ná bíodh eagla ort beagán a thaispeáint do do phearsantacht, ach cuimhnigh: Seo faoi do ghairm bheatha, ní tweeting faoi na Gardaí."<br/><br/>4) Coinnigh ar scoil ag freastal. Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil an chuid is mó de na céimithe ag iarraidh filleadh ar an seomra ranga, ach níl aon rud níos suntasaí d’fhostóir ionchasach ná iarratasóir a bhfuil creidmheasanna leanúnacha oideachais aige ina réimse féin nó duine a fhreastalaíonn ar sheimineáir ina réimse spéise. Coinnigh foghlaim, fiú tar éis duit dioplóma a bheith agat i do lámh."<br/><br/>5) Smaoinigh ar obair temp. "Is féidir leis an obair sealadach a bheith ina bhealach iontach chun do chuntas atosú a choinneáil padded agus do chuntas bainc iomlán," a deir Wilson. Is fuath le fostóirí spotaí móra bána a fheiceáil ar atosú iarratasóra, mar sin a chruthú go bhfuil tú ag obair go crua fiú nuair nach bhfuair tú post buan lánaimseartha fós. Ina theannta sin, is féidir le huainiú a bheith ina bhealach iontach chun naisc a dhéanamh, taithí a thógáil, agus níos mó a fhoghlaim faoi cad is maith leis a bheith ag obair i dtimpeallacht ghairmiúil." |
