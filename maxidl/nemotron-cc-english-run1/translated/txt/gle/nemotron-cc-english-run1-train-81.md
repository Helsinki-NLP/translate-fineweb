| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Johnson Acht um Chearta Vótála 1965.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Beagnach céad bliain ó shin, dúirt an 15ú leasú ar an mBunreacht, "Ní dhéanfaidh na Stáit Aontaithe dochar do cheart shaoránaigh na Stát Aontaithe vótáil ná ní dhéanfaidh aon stát, de bharr cine, dathanna ná bail a bhí ar fónamh roimhe sin." Agus beagnach céad bliain roimhe sin, bhí ár n-aithreacha bunaithe náisiúin ag tairiscint turgnamh mór an daonlathais Mheiriceá trína dhearbhú go bhfuil "na fir go léir comhionann".<br/><br/>Ba admháil é Acht um Chearta Vótála 1965 nach bhfuil mórán meáchain ag ár n-idéil bhunúsacha mura bhfuil siad cosanta leis an smacht reachta fiú i Meiriceá. Sin an fáth ar thug Alt 2 den 15ú Leasú “an chumhacht an tAirteagal seo a fhorfheidhmiú trí reachtaíocht iomchuí.”<br/><br/>Agus go deimhin, bhí teanga códaithe an Achta um Chearta Vótála in ann a bhaint amach cad é nach bhféadfadh an Comhdháil Athfhoirgníochta agus Thomas Jefferson a dhéanamh. Acht um Chearta Sibhialta 1964 agus an tAcht um Chearta Vótála, 1964 – agus an ghluaiseacht shibhialta as ar tháinig siad chun cinn mar chatalaíoch do mhéadú drámatúil ar an deis do Mheiriceánaigh dubha páirt a ghlacadh sa phróiseas daonlathach.<br/><br/>Mar shampla, níor cláraíodh ach 6.7 faoin gcéad de na daoine a bhí i dteideal a fháil amach as 1962; faoi 1969, bhí 66.5 faoin gcéad bainte amach ag an bhfigiúr sin. Sa lá atá inniu ann, tá níos mó oifigigh dubh tofa ag Mississippi ná aon stát eile.<br/><br/>Bhí na cosaintí a chuir an tAcht um Chearta Vótála i bhfeidhm i bhfad thar téarma nuair a ritheadh iad, mar ionadaí den streachailt uafásach ar baineadh amach iad. Ach ní dócha go bhfuil na cosaintí seo faoi ionsaí anois, ag cur an dul chun cinn a d'oibrigh ár náisiúin chomh deacair a bhaint amach.<br/><br/>An bhliain seo caite, i gcás shealbhóir Chontae Shelby v., chuir Cúirt Uachtarach na Stát Aontaithe comhpháirt lárnach den Acht um Chearta an Vótála a chuir ar chumas athbhreithniú réamhfhéileoireachta a dhéanamh chun a chinntiú go ndeachaigh aon dlí nua vótála i bhfeidhm.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Ar an drochuair, bhí an freagra a thug ceannairí na bPoblachtach ag déanamh aon rud. Chuaigh Ted Cruz agus Gov. Rick Perry amach as a mbealach chun cinneadh na Cúirte Uachtaraí a mholadh. Chuir Sen. Rand Paul isteach ar an riachtanas leanúnach atá ag an Acht um Chearta Vótála, trí aire a thabhairt, "Tá uachtarán ar an Afraic-Mheiriceánach againn."<br/><br/>Cé gur chloch mhíle stairiúil a bhí i dtoghchán an Uachtaráin Barack Obama, tá sé contúirteach smaoineamh go spreagann sé muid ó bheith ar an airdeall faoi iarmhairtí uafásacha ár náisiúin san am atá thart. Is deimhniú é go bhfuil na cosaintí a chuirtear i bhfeidhm le hAlt 4 fós riachtanach chun srianta vótála a achtú.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Tá srianta dochta aitheantais grianghraf sínithe ag gobharnóirí na bPoblachtacha sa dlí mar réiteach ar fhadhb beagnach nach bhfuil ann maidir le hinimirce vótála, mná a ghortú go díréireach, daoine óga, teaghlaigh oibre agus pobal na hAfraice-Mheiriceánach. Tá sé deacair do Phoblacht na hÉireann, ar nós Pól, vótaí na bpobal seo a lorg nuair a chreideann siad nach bhfuil aon rud cearr leis na srianta a chur i bhfeidhm a fhágann go bhfuil sé níos deacra do na dáilcheantair seo vótáil.<br/><br/>Ina theannta sin, d’iarr Poblachtánaigh srian a chur ar thréimhsí luatha vótála, lena n-áirítear an Domhnach roimh Lá Toghcháin, nuair a bhí rath mór ar eaglaisí san Afraic-Mheiriceánach le Souls ar na cláir sna Vótaí.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Is ionann na srianta seo agus iarracht callúil ag Poblachtánaigh chun vótáil a dhéanamh níos deacra, bunaithe ar ríomhanna polaitiúla caola, gearrthéarmacha ar féidir leis na Poblachtánaigh toghcháin a bhuachan trí mhéid na dtoghthóirí a laghdú.<br/><br/>Tá misean an-difriúil ag daonlathach maidir le vótáil: chun a chinntiú gur féidir le gach vótálaí incháilithe clárú, gur féidir le gach vótálaí cláraithe vótáil agus go ndéantar gach vóta a chomhaireamh go cruinn.<br/><br/>Fógraíocht<br/><br/>Léiríonn Tionscadal Náisiúnta Taibhithe an Choiste Náisiúnta Daonlathach ár gcreideamh go neartaíonn rannpháirtíocht an vótálaí ár náisiún agus ár ndaonlathas.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | C&A:Saineolaí cosanta i Vítneam don Athair Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 Meitheamh 2021<br/><br/>Íomhá an tAthair Hans Zollner SJ.<br/><br/>Bhí Uachtarán an Ionaid um Chosaint Leanaí sa Róimh, agus ball den Choimisiún Poncúil um Chosaint Mhionaoisigh, an tAthair Hans Zollner SJ, san Astráil, 2018 chun labhairt le ceannairí aireachta Chaitliceach agus le marthanóirí.<br/><br/>Shuigh Michael McVeigh ó Jeusit Communications leis le linn na cuairte chun iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi a bhfuil an Eaglais ag freagairt do ghéarchéim na mí-úsáide go hidirnáisiúnta, agus ar an méid is féidir a fhoghlaim ónár dtaithí san Astráil.<br/><br/>M: Is é seo do thríú turas go dtí an Astráil.

Táim an-sásta éisteacht le daoine freisin.<br/><br/>Luaigh tú gur gá éisteacht le híospartaigh agus tacú leo nuair a éisteamar leis, is léir go raibh an Coimisiún Ríoga anseo san Astráil, ach cad iad na bealaí eile a bhfaca tú go bhfuil tacaíocht á thabhairt do ghutha na n-íospartach ar fud an domhain?<br/><br/>Sa Fhrainc tá deoise amháin go bhfuil a bunaíodh cad glaoch siad 'An Spás Éisteachta'. Is féidir le híospartaigh teacht ar aghaidh agus is féidir leo iad féin a chur in iúl. Is spás oscailte é ina bhfuil daoine a ndearnadh dochar mór orthu saor in aisce ar a laghad a chur in iúl cad is mian leo a iarraidh ó cheannaireacht na hEaglaise srl.<br/><br/>Tá áiteanna eile i Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá nó i dtíortha eile inar tugadh cuireadh d'íospartaigh trí dheois, le Cúiges, le ceannaireacht na hEaglaise, le teacht ar aghaidh. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil iomlán is dóigh liom go bhfuil dea-thoil, agus go bhfuil níos mó daoine cosúil le easpag agus cúige a éist le híospartaigh ná mar atá a fhios againn. Ach níl aon samhail amháin ann d'íospartaigh a thabhairt ní amháin ar an spás chun iad féin a chur in iúl agus éisteacht leo, ach freisin chun dul i mbun forbairt Eaglaise go gníomhach.<br/><br/>Maidir le spásanna a bhunú le haghaidh tacaíochta d’íospartaigh, cad iad na rudaí a chonaic tú a d’fhéadfadh cabhrú i ndáiríre – agus a d’fhéadfadh a bheith ag smaoineamh anseo san Astráil?<br/><br/>Ceann de na príomh pointí a thugann go leor íospartaigh ná, ‘Ní féidir linn, laistigh de shuíomhanna na scoileanna, comhrá rialta a bheith againn ina leith sin a chuimsíonn marthanóirí mí-úsáide mar bhaill rialta de choiste, coimisiún, bord fuaime, grúpa aiseolais nó rud éigin mar sin?’ Mar sin, nach dtugtar an guth seo ach ar ócáid ar leith, nó i gcás go mothaíonn duine go bhfuil sé nó sí in ann labhairt faoi, ach [éisteacht] ar bhonn rialta – an guth sin a thógáil isteach sa chóras.<br/><br/>Cabhróidh sé sin linn go léir. Cabhróidh sé le maireachtáil agus le híospartaigh mar go mbraitheann siad go bhfuil fáilte rompu agus go bhfuil meas acu ar an taithí ar leith, agus ar na dúshláin shonracha a bhain leo sa saol. Ar an dara dul síos, cabhróidh sé leis an bpobal i gcoitinne, mar is féidir linn ar a laghad níos mó agus níos íogaire a dhéanamh dúinn féin maidir le cad iad na hábhair imní agus na riachtanais shonracha a bhaineann le marthanóirí – ar féidir leo labhairt freisin le riachtanais daoine óga.<br/><br/>M: Tá grúpaí láidre marthanóirí againn anseo san Astráil a bhí in ann tacú lena chéile tríd an bpróiseas sin. Ach cad atá á rá agat ná go bhfuil bealach éigin ag teastáil uainn chun tacú leis na grúpaí sin, agus chun tacú leis na daoine sin, trínár n-institiúidí féin chomh maith?<br/><br/>Agus is dóigh liom go gcaithfidh muid a bheith cruthaitheach. Oibreoidh sé do scoil amháin agus do pharóiste amháin agus do dheoise amháin ar bhealach amháin, agus do dhaoine eile ar bhealach difriúil. Toisc na marthanóirí a bhfuil mé i dteagmháil leanúnach, tá siad iarratais go leor den chineál céanna, agus taithí den chineál céanna maidir le fáilte a chur roimh san Eaglais nó nach bhfuil - mothú thrown amach nó a dhíbhe. Ach tá siad i measc iad féin freisin ionchais go leor éagsúla., Mar sin d'fhoghlaim mé go bhfuil tú freisin a bheith an-sonrú chun glacadh leis na difríochtaí i cad é an grúpa ar leith, nó an marthanóir ar leith, ba mhaith, iarratais agus riachtanais.<br/><br/>M: Survivors labhairt faoi ag iarraidh a gcuid scéalta a éisteacht agus a admháil., Tá muid go raibh an Coimisiún Ríoga anseo san Astráil, a bhí ar fáil próiseas neamhspleách nuair a d'fhéadfadh íospartaigh teacht ar aghaidh. An bhfuil gá le rud éigin mar sin ó thaobh na fírinne, an cheartais agus an phróisis athmhuintearais don Eaglais go hidirnáisiúnta?<br/><br/>H: Sea, is dóigh liom go bhfuil gá leis sin go hidirnáisiúnta. Ach is dóigh liom go gcaithfidh gach eaglais áitiúil a cuid oibre féin a dhéanamh. Ní fheicim go han-luath go gcuirfí roinnt comhairle nó coimisiún den sórt sin ar bun chun breathnú ar an réimse seo don Eaglais ar fad. Tá ballraíocht 1.3 billiún duine ag an Eaglais, agus tá sí i láthair i 190 tír, agus tá gach cineál difríochta ann maidir le hionchais i dtaca le tacaíocht shíceolaíoch, spioradálta agus airgeadais.<br/><br/>Tá rud amháin go bhfuil mé tar éis teacht go comhsheasmhach i dteagmháil le híospartaigh, ag obair leo agus ag éisteacht leo, agus is é sin gur mian leo a bheith ag éisteacht leis. Mar sin dá mbeadh an mothú ann go raibh íospartaigh á n-éisteacht i gcónaí – sa Róimh agus in áiteanna eile – is dóigh liom go dtabharfadh sé sin faoiseamh mór d’íospartaigh go leor.<br/><br/>Sílim go bhfuil imní ar an imní atá orm, go háirithe maidir le do cheist, go ndéanann na heaglaisí áitiúil cibé rud is féidir leo a dhéanamh ionas go n-éistfear íospartaigh sa tír áirithe sin. Tá liosta agam de na daoine atá ag iarraidh labhairt leis an Athair Naofa go díreach, agus go fisiciúil tá sé dodhéanta. Bhí mé ann in 2014 le haistriú go ceann dhá mharthanóirí Gearmánacha a roghnaíodh le beirt Éireannach agus beirt mharthanóirí Sasanacha nuair a fuair sé nó sí sé dhuine acu sa bhaile. Maidir le gach ceann, bhí sé ann ar feadh 40 go 45 nóiméad. An raibh sé chun é seo a dhéanamh do gach marthanóir nach bhféadfadh sé níos mó a chodladh.<br/><br/>Is é an sampla atá aige ná samhaltú don Eaglais Chaitliceach ar fad an tslí ina bhfaightear, ina gcuirtear fáilte roimh íospartaigh agus faoi mharthanóirí agus ina n-éistear éisteacht léi. Sílim an bhfuil na easpag agus na pribhléidí sa saol seo, i ngach tír, ina dhiaidh sin, bheadh a lán marthanóirí a bheith buíoch as sin i ndáiríre.<br/><br/>Taifeadadh Ardeaspag Diarmuid Martin, díreach roimh Chruinniú Domhanda Teaghlaigh, mar gheall ar an gCoimisiún Féideartha, ag rá go bhfuil sé ró-bheag, mar atá sé faoi láthair, chun an méid a theastaíonn uaidh a bhaint amach. An gá an Eaglais a bheith ag cur níos mó acmhainní isteach ar an dóigh a bhfuil sé ag maoirseacht ar na saincheisteanna sin?<br/><br/>Faoi láthair táimid 16 bhall ó gach mór-roinn go bunúsach, agus na grúpaí móra teanga. Léirímid réimse disciplíní agus gairmeacha, agus is é cuspóir an choimisiúin — de réir mar is ionann na reachtanna atá díreach tar éis a fhógairt – comhairle a chur ar fáil don Athair Naofa.<br/><br/>Is ionann míthuiscint choitianta faoin gcoimisiún agus an chéad rud a phléaimid le cásanna líomhaintí.Ní hé sin an cás. Níl aon chumhacht dlínse nó riaracháin againn maidir le cásanna, mar maidir le líomhaintí faoi mhí-úsáid na mbinsí agus an nós imeachta.<br/><br/>Is é an dara míthuiscint atá againn ná go gcuirfimid rudaí chun cinn, go díreach, ar an talamh.Is é an chéad sprioc atá againn ná go dtabharfaimid comhairle don Athair Naofa ar shaincheisteanna.<br/><br/>Mar sin, ó mo thaobh, tá, ní mór dúinn a infheistiú níos mó. Ach ní mór dúinn tuilleadh infheistíochta a dhéanamh ar an leibhéal áitiúil, agus ní mór dúinn a chinntiú go gcuirtear na moltaí ón gCoimisiún Ponta ar aghaidh chuig an Athair Naofa – a dhéanann an tUachtarán de ghnáth – agus ansin tá próiseas leantach ann a léiríonn an méid atá tugtha againn mar chomhairle againn.<br/><br/>San Astráil, tá Caighdeán Gairmiúil Caitliceach Teoranta ag déanamh maoirseacht ar fhreagairt na hEaglaise agus ag cur treoirlínte agus tacaíocht ar fáil chun a chinntiú gur institiúidí sábháilte leanaí iad na hinstitiúidí go léir san Eaglais. An bhfuil gá le cineál éigin de thacaíocht eagraíochtúil ón Róimh do na easpaí agus na deoise sin atá ag streachailt chun na hinstitiúidí sin a fhoirmiú agus chun cosaint a thabhairt sna galair sin?<br/><br/>I mo thuairimse, ar deireadh, forbróidh an Coimisiún sa líne sin. Tá siad anois sa phróiseas chun saineolaithe a fhostú sna réimsí sin.<br/><br/>Is dóigh liom gur gá don Eaglais a thuiscint gur féidir leis na heaglaisí áitiúla foghlaim óna chéile go frithpháirteach. Agus dar liom go bhfuil an t-Athair Naofa i gcuimhne dúinn - nach bhfeidhmeoidh an Eaglais mar chuideachta láraithe. Ní oibríonn sé mar sin, go héifeachtach. Gach easpaig, tá, go pointe áirithe, ag gach comhdháil easpaig, a shaol ar a chuid féin.Is é an rud is gá dúinn níos mó a fhoghlaim ná bealaí cumarsáide frithpháirteacha a oscailt.<br/><br/>Mar shíceolaí agus mar dhuine a bhuail agus a d’oibrigh le marthanóirí, cad iad na smaointe atá agat maidir leis an gceist sin?<br/><br/>Sílim gurb é an cheist a dtagann mí-úsáid as an gceann is tábhachtaí, agus tá an Pápa dírithe go bhfuil ina litir chuig muintir Dé a foilsíodh ar an 20 Lúnasa. Deir sé sa chéad mhír, agus déanann sé é a athdhéanamh arís agus arís eile, go bhfuil ceist na mí-úsáide gnéis nasctha i gcónaí – nó i gcónaí nasctha – ní hamháin le ceist na húsáide a bhaineann le cumhacht, ach freisin le mí-úsáid coinsiasa.<br/><br/>Mar sin tá an cheist fíor-bhunúsach maidir le mí-úsáid i bhfad níos casta ná díreach [an cheist] gnéasachta - bíodh sé heitrighnéasach nó homosexual. Is ceist chumhachta í, agus ní mór dúinn oibriú i ndáiríre ar an gceist leis an gcaoi a dtuigimid an t-éileamh, conas a thuigimid an easpat, conas a thuigimid agus a chrímid ár n-aireachtaí? Cad iad na teorainneacha?<br/><br/>Sin an fáth go bhfuil mé an-sásta go bhfuil an Cúige Íosa san Astráil ag bunú Cód Iompair.Toisc nach féidir linn labhairt ach faoi mhí-úsáid ghnéasach na mionaoiseach. Labhraímid faoi mhí-úsáid ghnéasach daoine fásta, agus labhraímid faoi mhí-úsáid ar bhealaí eile – cosúil le mí-úsáid ar choinsiasa, áit a measann tú do dhuine a cheapann tú, nó a chuireann tú ar an eolas faoi Dhia, agus is féidir leat insint do dhuine eile, ‘Ní mór duit é sin a dhéanamh’, i gcoinne choinsias an duine sin.<br/><br/>Smaoiníonn a lán daoine ar an gcéimeolaíocht go dtáirgeann siad mí-úsáid. Mar a deir mé i gcónaí, ní hamháin go bhfuil an litearthacht mar sin ina chúis le mí-úsáid - ar shlí eile conas a mhíníonn muid nach gcónaíonn 99.9 faoin gcéad de na mí-úsáideoirí uile ar an saol, agus conas a mhíníonn muid nach bhfuil mí-úsáid á dhéanamh ag 95 nó 96 faoin gcéad de na sagairt uile? Ach, celebrity, nó vow de chastity, nach bhfuil comhtháite i ndáiríre, nach bhfuil i ndáiríre beo amach i gceart - yes, go bhfuil fadhb. Uaireanta tógann daoine ag ól, uaireanta a ghlacann siad le cearrbhachas, agus uaireanta bíonn mí-iompar gnéasach acu, le daoine fásta agus le mionaoisigh.<br/><br/>Is í an fhíorcheist faoi seo an chaoi a ndéileálann muid le coincheap na cumhachta spioradálta reiligiúnach a n-infheistítear sagairt agus easpagí? Conas is féidir leis an diagacht cabhrú linn tuiscint a fháil ar, agus b’fhéidir conas is féidir leis an socheolaíocht, síceolaíocht, nó riarachán gnó cabhrú linn teorainneacha na cumhachta a shainiú, agus an gá atá le do theorainneacha a choinneáil |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Níl mé ionadh ag an mí-oiriúnú seo.Go deimhin, ba mhaith liom dul fiú chomh fada agus a rá nach bhfuil sé seo rud éigin a athrú riamh, ná ba chóir dúinn a fháil ar fad steamed ar bun faoi é a athrú. I 10 mbliana, beidh orainn imeall bleeding fós, míreanna casta ar an liosta imní is mó, agus beidh na rudaí atá á fháil againn ar deireadh a thuiscint a bheith ar an chuid is mó dár gcaiteachas.<br/><br/>Anois, tá pointí den scoth ag Gunnar agus Andy araon, go sonrach maidir le foirne TF a fheiceann fadhbanna TF agus iad a réiteach le réitigh TF; i ndáiríre, táim dearfach go bhfuil fiúntais ag baint lena gcuid pointí.<br/><br/>Ach is dóigh liom go bhfuil smaointe eile a trump siúd (rinne mé trácht ar a gcuid blaganna mar gheall air, agus ina dhiaidh sin chinn mé díreach tar éis blag a dhéanamh anseo). Tá na 3 imní is fearr sin sách nua:<br/><br/>eagla orainn rudaí nua toisc nach bhfuil muid iad a thuiscint, nó nach bhfuil iad a thuiscint toisc go bhfuil siad nua.<br/><br/>tá siad ró-nua dúinn go bhfuil cur chuige láidir chun iad a láimhseáil.<br/><br/>tá siad ró-nua dúinn chun a fháil amach an ba chóir dúinn a bheith buartha nó nach bhfuil! claonadh againn chun réamhshocraithe a paranoid / imní, a bhfuil go maith!<br/><br/>ró-nua le míreanna buiséid soiléire a shanntar dóibh a cheannach bosca nó roinnt bogearraí a chur ar fáil "slándála" nó "slándáil na meán sóisialta"?<br/><br/>tá siad chomh nua nach bhfuil a fhios fiú an gnó conas iad a úsáid nó cad ba mhaith leo as., Lig ina n-aonar conas is féidir linn a dhaingniú iad ag cruinniú go fóill nó ar a laghad nach bhfuil ag stopadh gach cuid de riachtanais ghnó. Mura bhfuil a fhios ag an ngnó fiú conas iad a úsáid go fóill, níl mé cinnte go bhfuil slándáil in aon áit chun an úsáid sin a threorú go sábháilte.<br/><br/>Ba chóir a lua freisin go bhfuil na rudaí nua seo á mbrú den chuid is mó trí thalamh tomhaltóirí agus isteach sa ghnó, le SÉ mar chineál de, "Oh yera yeah"," smaoineamh. ballaí Dóiteáin, AV, AM, Author Is freagairtí TF ar cheisteanna IT de ghnáth.

Cuireann gnó saincheisteanna an-chasta i láthair a mbíonn daoine bainteach leo go minic (rud nach féidir linn a phaiste) agus nach n-oirfeadh sé go deas i rialacha blaincéad. Fiú má chasamar ar shiúl ó réitigh theicniúla agus má chaitheamar ár gcuid ama chun na fadhbanna seo a réiteach, níl siad fós le réiteach go néata.Mar an gcéanna, nuair a thagann brú ar shove, an féidir leat a bheith agat agus freastal ar spriocanna le ballaí dóiteáin?An féidir leat a thaispeáint feabhas?

Cinnte, is féidir na 3 ábhar imní is fearr a rá a phunáil trí bhallaí dóiteáin agus deighleoga líonra, ach is é sin nádúr na rudaí sin (tá "punáil meán sóisialta" trí balla dóiteáin i bhfad níos difriúil ná mar a bhí mé ag brú trí nasc SSH chun mo líonra baile a dhroicheadú; tá na meáin shóisialta cosúil leis an nasc *Úsáid SSH tar éis an shealbhú a bheith puncháil cheana féin toisc go bhfuil sé riachtanach;.i. meáin shóisialta an bealach a úsáidtear calafort 80.)<br/><br/>Go bunúsach, cuireann na comharthaí go léir in iúl nach bhfuil ionadh orthu ag an díocas seo.Agus ní dóigh liom gur léiriú breise é seo go bhfuil sé mícheart, nó nach bhfuil sé ailínithe go cuí le gnó, nó go bhfuil cúlra teicniúil dorcha-freastalaí aige. Níl mé ag rá go bhfuil muid ag déanamh rudaí ceart nó táimid ailínithe i gceart, ach nach bhfuil an méid sin thuas argóint maith chun tacú leis an teoiric na heasnaimh sin.<br/><br/>Anois le haghaidh léim i ndáiríre mór., ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an méadú atá ann faoi láthair i ríomhaireacht soghluaiste a bheith chomh mór le tabhairt isteach na ríomhairí isteach sa ghnó agus níos déanaí ar an ríomhaire / idirlíon isteach sa ghnó.

Is féidir liom a rá fiú an rud céanna do na meáin shóisialta. Tá siad damned nua agus tá siad athruithe mór thar díreach a thabhairt i Macs nó bogearraí nua nó roinnt próiseas gnó nua. |
