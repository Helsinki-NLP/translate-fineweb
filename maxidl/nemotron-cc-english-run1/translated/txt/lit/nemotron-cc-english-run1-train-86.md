| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Istorinis Leclaire rajonas, kažkada vadinamas Edwardsville "priemiesčiu į pietus", buvo įkurtas kaip kooperacinė bendruomenė 1890 m. Ir išliko atskiru kaimu iki 1934 m. Prijungtas prie Edwardsville miesto. Laikraščiai ir žurnalai visoje JAV ir Europoje pranešė apie Leclaire eksperimentą, ypač per pirmuosius 20 jo egzistavimo metų. 1979 m., Dėl savo unikalios istorijos, buvęs kaimas buvo įtrauktas į nacionalinį istorinių vietų registrą.<br/><br/>„Leclaire“ įkūrė Nelsonas Oliveris Nelsonas, Sankt Luiso santechnikos gamintojas, kuris daugelį metų siekė išplėsti darbo klasės padėtį. Nelsonas norėjo pagerinti savo darbuotojų darbo sąlygas ir aprūpinti būstu netoli gamyklų, kad darbuotojai ir jų šeimos galėtų lengvai dalyvauti įmonės siūlomose nemokamose rekreacinėse ir edukacinėse programose. Iki 1890 m., kol dar buvo Sent Luise, N. O. Nelsono kompanijos gamybos ir platinimo įmonės pradėjo teikti pelno pasidalijimą kartu su švietimo ir poilsio galimybėmis. Leclaire bendradarbiavimo eksperimentas duotų papildomos naudos.<br/><br/>Kai Nelsono darbuotojai nurodė, kad nori persikelti į kaimo vietovę, bendrovės atstovai kreipėsi į kelių Misūrio ir Ilinojaus bendruomenių mažų miestų vadovus netoli savo Sent Luiso būstinės. Jie ieškojo tinkamo turto naujoms gamykloms ir pavyzdiniam kaimui. Į pietus nuo Edvardsvilio jie rado 125 akrų žemės sklypą su prieiga prie vandens, anglies ir transporto. Vietiniai verslininkai greitai veikė, kad pasiūlytų finansinę paskatą. Mažiau nei per tris savaites bendruomenė surinko 20 000 JAV dolerių fondą iš atskirų įnašų nuo 1 iki 1000 JAV dolerių, kad paskatintų Nelsoną pasirinkti Edwardsville savo verslui.<br/><br/>Miesto vadovai tikėjosi rasti nekilnojamąjį turtą Edwardsville miesto ribose, tačiau, kai nebuvo galima rasti tinkamos vietos, jie buvo įsitikinę, kad Nelsono investicija į pietus nuo miesto netrukus taps Edwardsville dalimi. Nors Nelsonas įvykdė visus statybos ir darbo vietų kūrimo nenumatytus atvejus savo sutartyje, tai būtų 44 metai iki aneksijos į Edwardsville. Leclaire, ribojasi su Madison/Brown Avenues į rytus, geležinkelio bėgiai į vakarus, Hadley/McKinley Avenues į pietus ir Wolf Street į šiaurę, išliko nepriklausomas kaimas nuo 1890 iki 1934 metų. Per tą laiką ji užsitarnavo verslo, švietimo ir gyvenamųjų namų planavimo naujovių reputaciją.<br/><br/>Leclaire kaimas 1931 m. Edwardsville žemėlapyje<br/>Žymė: Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Iki 1880 m. pabaigos jis buvo tarptautinis lyderis bendradarbiavimo ir pelno pasidalijimo srityse, keisdamasis socialinėmis teorijomis su kitais visame pasaulyje, tuo pačiu plečiant savo verslą Sent Luise. Jis pavadino savo eksperimentinį kaimą po Paryžiaus pelno pasidalijimo, Edme Jean Leclaire, bet jis aplankė daugelį kitų socialinių vizionierių, kurie suteikė informacijos ir įkvėpimo. Sudarydamas geriausias idėjas iš šių pavyzdžių, Nelsonas įkūrė Leclaire'ą, sakydamas, kad "suteikti darbą, skatinti intelektą, suteikti poilsį, puoselėti grožį ir kurti namus". Tai buvo visi veiksniai, kuriuos jis nusprendė, kad vyrai turi vadovauti pilnaverčiam gyvenimui. Vėlesni rašytojai naudojo šiuos žodžius, kad suformuluotų Leclaire’o pagrindinius principus: darbas, namai, švietimas, poilsis ir grožis, bet su papildomu svarbiu laisvės principu.<br/><br/>Darbas<br/><br/>Darbas galėtų būti laikomas svarbiausiu iš šių veiksnių, nes be gamyklos darbo vietų Leclaire nebūtų kaimo. Plytų fabriko pastatus suprojektavo architektas E. A. Cameron, kad užtikrintų natūralią šviesą, ventiliaciją vasarą ir šildomas grindis žiemą. Buvo įrengta gaisro gesinimo sistema ir, nors pramoninės avarijos nebuvo pašalintos, buvo dedamos visos pastangos, kad būtų užtikrintas darbuotojų saugumas. Ivy padengti plytų pastatai buvo apsupti gerai manikiūruotų vejų ir gėlių sodų, suteikiančių kompleksui universiteto išvaizdą. 1894 m. Niujorko pasaulio reporterė Nellie Bly pavadino pastatus "idealiu pastatų tobulumu, kad žmogus galėtų dirbti".<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company gamybos kompleksas Leclaire<br/>Iš Leclaire draugų<br/><br/>Nelsono įmonės politika buvo sukurta siekiant apsaugoti darbuotojų finansinį stabilumą. Darbuotojai galėjo uždirbti dalį pelno ir turėti balsą įmonėje, jei jie pasirinko šią parinktį. Pelno pasidalijimo planas suteikė Nelsono darbuotojams pasididžiavimą nuosavybe, dėl kurios buvo palaikoma darbo jėga. Bėgant metams buvo keli trumpalaikiai darbo streikai, tačiau dažniausiai darbo problemos buvo retos. Darbuotojai taip pat turėjo protingas valandas ir konkurencingą darbo užmokestį. Buvo įsteigtas draudimo fondas, kuris numatė pensijas ir nedarbingumo atostogas, taip pat našlių pensijas, jei darbuotojas mirė, nepriklausomai nuo to, ar mirtis buvo susijusi su jo darbu.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) būstinė liko Sent Luise, tačiau visa N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company buvo perkelta į Leclaire. Gamybos įmonė buvo padalinta į parduotuves, kuriose buvo gaminami įvairūs produktai. 1900 m. parduotuvės tapo nepriklausomomis įmonėmis mokesčių tikslais, tačiau visos jos vis dar priklausė N. O. Nelsono gamybos įmonei. Parduotuvėse buvo kabineto malūnas, kuriame buvo gaminami medienos gaminiai nuo spintos iki malūno. Čia dirbę kvalifikuoti amatininkai taip pat vykdė specialias sutartis, įskaitant vietinio banko banko narvus ir aukurą, kuris vis dar naudojamas Šv. Marmuro parduotuvė specializuojasi architektūrinio marmuro, kuris buvo supjaustytas ir įdiegtas Nelsono ekipažų namuose, įmonėse ir net valstybiniuose sostinėse visoje Vidurio Vakaruose. Mašinų parduotuvė, kuri tapo "Bignall" ir "Keeler", pagamino vamzdžių montavimo mašinas, siurblius, matuoklius ir įvairius mechaninius įrankius, kurių tikimasi santechnikos prekyboje. Jie taip pat išsišakojo gaminti specialius daiktus, tokius kaip "Leclaire" dviratis 1890-ųjų viduryje. Žalvario parduotuvėje buvo liejykla, kurioje buvo gaminami įvairūs vandentiekio vamzdžiai ir įrankiai. Šie pavyzdžiai atspindi tik kai kuriuos Leclaire gamyklose atliktus darbus. Bendrovės logotipas buvo stilizuotas "NONCO", kurį šiandien vis dar galima pamatyti ant santechnikos ir kai kurių priešgaisrinių hidrantų Edwardsville mieste.<br/><br/>Namai<br/><br/>Prieš statant namus, reikėjo būsto darbuotojams, kurie baigė gamyklos pastatus, taip pat statė namus. Siekdama patenkinti šiuos poreikius, bendrovė pastatė "Klubo namą", didelį pastatą, kuris tarnavo daugeliui tikslų. Be apgyvendinimo, tai buvo pirmasis bendruomenės švietimo pastatas, kuriame buvo gerai įrengta biblioteka.<br/><br/>Gyvenamosios Leclaire dalies statyba prasidėjo iš karto po to, kai kaimas buvo įkurtas 1890 m. Birželio mėn. Julius Pitzman, novatoriškas kraštovaizdžio architektas, kuris išdėstė pirmąsias partijas Leclaire, sukūrė juos su daugybe apsauginių sandorų. Sandoros numatė plačias, išlenktas gatves, didelius sklypus ir teisės aktą, kuris apribojo nuosavybę tik gyvenamaisiais ar švietimo tikslais. Bendrovė nutiesė gatves, įrengė elektrinius gatvių žibintus, įrengė šaligatvius ir pasodino šimtus medžių Leclaire gatvėse. Vėliau Leclaire sekcijos buvo išdėstytos įprastu tinkleliu ir mažesnėmis partijomis, tačiau vis tiek buvo taikomi apribojimai.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Viktorijos laikų kotedžas 1907 m.<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Iš pradžių namus pastatė bendrovė, o po to beveik kainavo Nelsono darbuotojams, kad paskatintų namų nuosavybę. Jei darbuotojas susirgo ir negalėjo padaryti savo hipotekos, mokėjimai buvo sustabdyti iki grįžęs į darbą. Namai buvo siūlomi įvairiais namų dizainais, o bendrovė paskelbė, kad nėra dviejų vienodų būstų. Ankstyviausi namai pirmiausia buvo Viktorijos laikų kotedžai, kuriuose buvo elektra ir tekantis vanduo. Gyventojai galėjo nusipirkti įmonės pastatytą namą arba tuščią sklypą ir patys pasistatyti namą, jei tik architektūrinis projektas atitiko įmonės standartus.<br/><br/>Vėlesniais metais sklypai buvo parduoti investuotojams, paprastai Edwardsville gyventojams, o daugelį namų 1920-aisiais pastatė vietiniai rangovai, kurie vėliau juos pardavė vietos gyventojams.<br/><br/>Švietimas<br/><br/>Nelsonas tikėjo švietimu visiems, įskaitant darbo klasę. Švietimo programavimas prasidėjo nuo vaikų darželio Klubo namuose 1892 m. Ir tęsėsi naujame švietimo pastate 722 Holyoake Road. Paprastai vadinamas "Mokyklos namai", šis pastatas suteikė didelę salę susitikimams ir programoms, tačiau turėjo judančias pertvaras, kad per dieną būtų galima padalinti į klases. Vakarais vyko „Leclaire Self-Culture Club“ šokiai, susitikimai ar programos, kuriose kas savaitę skaitydavo paskaitas Vašingtono universiteto profesoriai ar nacionaliniu mastu žinomi pranešėjai, kurie, kaip ir N. O. Nelsonas, buvo socialinio tobulėjimo judėjimo dalis šimtmečio sandūroje. Tarp jų buvo Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones ir autorius Charlotte Perkins Gilman.<br/><br/>1913 m. įstojo į „Leclaire“ vaikų darželį<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Per dešimt metų po 1895 m. Švietimo pastato statybos buvo atlikta nemažai švietimo eksperimentų, įskaitant pramonės mokyklą, koledžą, naktinę mokyklą ir akademiją. Ankstyviausias ir ilgiausiai gyvenęs bandymas buvo 1892 m. Įkurtas rytinis vaikų darželis, kuriame buvo naudojamas Fröbel modelis. Ši dvejų metų programa buvo nemokama visiems, įskaitant Edwardsville vaikus, iki 1931 m., Kai dėl finansinių priežasčių bendrovė pradėjo apmokestinti studentus, kurie nebuvo darbuotojų vaikai. Nelson Manufacturing valdė vaikų darželį iki 1934 m., Kai pastatas buvo perduotas Edwardsville mokyklų rajonui už nominalų mokestį.<br/><br/>Rekreacija<br/><br/>Laivai Leclaire ežere 1915 m.<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreacija buvo svarbus Leclaire bruožas. Bendrovė suteikė sporto įrenginius beisbolo, teniso, o vėliau, futbolas. Boulingo ir biliardas salė buvo pastatyta ir ten buvo ežeras valtimis, plaukiojimas, žvejyba, ar čiuožimo žiemą. Leclaire parkas buvo aprūpintas valčių nameliais, vyrų ir moterų pirtimis ir dideliu paviljonu. Gyventojai organizavo šokius, hayrides, rašybos bites ir kitas veiklas, o bendrovė rėmė grupę, kuri reguliariai grojo pramogose kaime ar Edwardsville. Kaip ir "Club House" ir "School House" švietimo funkcijos, "Leclaire" rekreacinės patalpos buvo atviros visiems ir dažnai buvo Edwardsville ir net Sent Luiso lankytojams.<br/><br/>Grožis<br/><br/>Ankstyvoji Leclaire ežero nuotrauka<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Paskutinis iš veiksnių, kuriuos Nelsonas laikė svarbiais patenkinamam gyvenimui, buvo susijęs su aplinka. Nelsonas žinojo apie sveikos gyvensenos svarbą. Jis įvertino grožį ir švarą, kurią galima rasti šalyje, ir paskatino visus Leclaire puošti savo turtą sodinant sodus ir sodus. Nelsonas pats vadovavo pavyzdžiu, todėl įmonės šiltnamyje buvo teikiamos nemokamos gėlės ir vyko konkursai gražiausiems kiemams. Leclaire buvo išdėstyta taip, kad visas kaimas turėjo parko aplinką, kuri vis dar akivaizdi šiandien.<br/><br/>Laisvė<br/><br/>„Leclaire Cooperative“ parduotuvė<br/>Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelsonas išvardijo penkis pagrindinius Leclaire principus, tačiau šiuolaikiniai rašytojai prideda šeštą: Laisvė. Visos bendrovės siūlomos programos buvo prieinamos darbuotojams, taip pat vietiniams gyventojams, tačiau nė viena nebuvo privaloma. Laisvė pasirinkti, ar dalyvauti įmonės programose, ar ne, buvo visiškai individuali. Leclaire gyventojai galėjo dirbti Nelson Manufacturing ar kitur, o darbuotojai nebuvo įpareigoti gyventi Leclaire. Dalyvavimas rekreacinėse ir edukacinėse programose taip pat buvo neprivalomas. Taip pat buvo įmonės parduotuvė, kurioje darbuotojai galėjo apsipirkti, tačiau, skirtingai nuo kitų įmonės miestų, niekas nebuvo skolingas įmonės parduotuvei. "Leclaire Store" buvo kooperatyvas, kurio nariai buvo apmokestinti sąžiningomis rinkos kainomis, tačiau vėliau buvo mokami ketvirčio dividendai.<br/><br/>Kitoks įmonės miestas<br/><br/>Visi šie privalumai padarė Leclaire unikalų iš kitų įmonės miestų. Tačiau buvo ir individualių atvejų, kai įmonė parodė užuojautą ir rūpinimąsi darbuotojais. Įmonė uždarė gamyklas ir pasamdė ekskursinius traukinius, kad darbuotojai ir jų šeimos nariai galėtų nuvykti į Sent Luisą vienai dienai 1904 m. Sent Luiso pasaulinėje mugėje. Kai pinigai buvo įtempti, Nelsonas retkarčiais į kiekvieną darbo užmokesčio paketą įdėjo papildomų pinigų, kad palengvintų darbuotojų gyvenimą, o jei jis sukūrė programą, su kuria vyrai nesutiko, jie kalbėjo apie tai ir, kaip dažnai, Nelsonas pasuko atgal.<br/><br/>Gimęs 1841 m. Lilesande, Norvegijoje, N. O. Nelsonas buvo sudėtingas žmogus. Jis buvo kapitalistas, kuris tikėjo laisvu verslu, bet taip pat socialistas, "Aukso taisyklės" pasekėjas ir patriotas, kuris tarnavo Sąjungai pilietiniame kare. Iki 1900 m. Jis buvo multimilijonierius, tačiau iki jo mirties 1922 m. Jis atidavė viską, kad pagerintų darbo klasę.<br/><br/>Nors Leclaire'as nebuvo vienintelis Nelsono socialinis eksperimentas, jis laikomas sėkmingiausiu jo siekiu. Kitos svarbios socialinės gerovės pastangos buvo kooperatyvinių maisto prekių parduotuvių tinklas Naujajame Orleane, vaikų darželis juodaodžių darbuotojų vaikams jo Bessemeryje, Alabamoje, gamyklose ir vartotojų namai Indijoje, Kalifornijoje.<br/><br/>Nelsono Leclaire kaimas buvo žinomas tarptautiniu mastu kaip vertas dėmesio ir sėkmingas eksperimentas. Jis buvo aprašytas Niujorke daug kartų, bet ypač žurnalistė Nellie Bly 1894 m., Kuris ilgai rašė apie pavyzdinį miestą, kur "Darbo klausimas išspręstas ir visi laimingi mažame kaime netoli Sent Luiso". Los Angeles Times taip pat reguliariai pranešė apie N. O. Nelsoną, kaip ir Chicago Daily Tribune bei daugelį kitų leidinių.<br/><br/>Savo kalboje Leclaire'o 15-ųjų metinių proga 1915 m. Nelsonas sakė: „Leclaire“ suteikia jums platų atvirą svetingumą ir siūlo jums šiandien mėgautis lengvumu ir komfortu bei grožiu ir įkvėpimu, kurį mes mėgaujamės kiekvieną dieną“. Nuo tos dienos praėjo daugiau nei šimtas metų, tačiau kvietimas vis dar galioja. Gyventojai ir mokslininkai kviečiami sužinoti apie Leclaire istoriją ir apsvarstyti pamokas, kurias galima išmokti ateities kartoms.<br/><br/>Vienas iš buvusių gamybos komplekso pastatų 2019 m., Kuris dabar tarnauja kaip N. O.

Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Autorius Apsilankymai per „Zoom“ arba „Skype“<br/><br/>Džiaugiuosi, kad apsilankysite su savo mokiniais per "Zoom" arba "Skype"! "Skype" yra puiki galimybė mokykloms / klasėms, kurios nepateikia asmeninių autorių, bet nori ištirti knygas ir poeziją, susisiekti su autoriumi ir užduoti klausimus apie vieną asmenį.<br/><br/>Išlaidos<br/><br/>Siūlau 30-45 minučių "Zoom" arba "Skype" vizitus su mokyklomis už 125 USD už sesiją (arba 200 USD už dvi sesijas, vykstančias per tris valandas ryte arba po pietų; 325 USD už tris sesijas per vieną dieną; 425 USD už keturias sesijas per vieną dieną). Kiekvienoje sesijoje stengiuosi kuo aktyviau įtraukti vaikus. Ne, tai nėra tas pats ryšys, kaip ir asmeninio apsilankymo pasiūlymai, tačiau jis vis tiek gali būti įkvepiantis ir motyvuojantis vaikams!<br/><br/>Ką aš darau<br/><br/>Kiekvieną sesiją, skirtą iki 50 studentų, sudaro:<br/><br/>5 minutės technologijų diegimo<br/><br/>3 segmentai po 10ish-minučių kiekvienas — Galite pasirinkti iš:<br/><br/>Kaip aš tapau rašytoju<br/><br/>Rašyti šią knygą (pasirinkite, į kurią knygą koncentruojuosi)<br/><br/>Skaitymas (aš skaitau keletą eilėraščių, o vaikai padeda man skaityti kitus)<br/><br/>Klasės pristatymas (jūsų mokiniai įdėti skaitymo ar spektaklio man - labai dėkinga auditorija!)<br/><br/>Poezijos rašymas kartu<br/><br/>Klausimų ir atsakymų sesija<br/><br/>5 minutės apvyniojimo / atsisveikinimo<br/><br/>Taip pat kalbuosi su ikimokyklinio ugdymo mokytojais ar mokytojų grupėmis apie poeziją ir rašymą.<br/><br/>Patarimai puikiam virtualiam vizitui<br/><br/>Patarimai sėkmingam virtualiam vizitui<br/><br/>Vienas iš mano tikslų virtualių mokyklų vizitų yra užfiksuoti interaktyvumą, kuris daro in-asmens vizitus sėkmingas ir įdomus. Bet tiesa yra ta, kad kartais tai sunku būti virtualiai interaktyvus! Laikas gali būti netinkamai sinchronizuotas, todėl skaitymas kartu tampa iššūkiu, ir man labai sunku išgirsti atskirus mokinius, nebent jie ateina ir kalba tiesiai į mikrofoną / kompiuterį. Bet po tam tikrų bandymų ir klaidų, aš atradau keletą būdų, kaip turėti geriausius virtualius vizitus įmanoma. Čia jie yra: 10 būdų, kaip padaryti mano vizitą su savo studentais puiki patirtis!<br/><br/>Prieš vizitą<br/><br/>Gaukite vaikus kuo labiau susijaudinęs apie vizitą. Apsilankykite mano svetainėje su jais. Perskaitykite kai kurias mano knygas su jais. Surinkite keletą klausimų, kuriuos studentai turi man. Viskas, ką jūs darote iš anksto, kad jaustumėtės kaip didelis pasiūlymas, nueis ilgą kelią studentų įsitraukimo link.<br/><br/>Padėkite vaizdo kamerą ar nešiojamąjį kompiuterį su kamera, kad galėčiau pamatyti kuo daugiau auditorijos. Sunku įvertinti studentų įsitraukimą, kai galiu pamatyti tik porą studentų.<br/><br/>Apriboti kiekvieną grupę iki 50 studentų. Neįtikėtinai sunku įtraukti dideles grupes per vaizdo įrašą.<br/><br/>Greitai pereisiu nuo temos prie temos ar poemos prie poemos. Prašome priminti studentams, kad jie turės atidžiai klausytis, kad suprastų, kas vyksta.<br/><br/>Kartais aš darau šiek tiek Skaitytojo teatras su studentais. Jei aš atsiųsiu jums bet scenarijų studentų dalys iš anksto, spausdinti kopiją kiekvieną sesiją ir supjaustyti į gabalus, jei reikia.<br/><br/>Vizito metu<br/><br/>Kai aš aptarti knygą, jei turite tą spausdintą knygą, prašome laikyti jį studentams pamatyti.<br/><br/>Jūs esate mano proxy. Aš dažnai negaliu skambinti studentams ir išgirsti individualius atsakymus. Taigi, aš galėčiau pasakyti, "Mes ketiname gauti 3 idėjas. Pakelkite ranką, jei turite idėją." Tada jūs perimate, paskambinkite trims studentams ir paskelbkite šiuos atsakymus visiems kambaryje ir man.<br/><br/>Pasirinkite pasitikintys, išeinantys studentai scenarijų studentų dalių (jei aš siųsti bet iš anksto). Savo asmeninių apsilankymų mokykloje metu bandau ištraukti kai kuriuos mažiau pasitikinčius moksleivius, tačiau radau, kad tai neveikia ir virtualių vizitų metu, nes aš jų negirdžiu.<br/><br/>Ar studentai su kalbėjimo dalių sėdėti priekyje. Kai atėjo laikas, juos atsistoti ir priminti jiems kalbėti garsiai.<br/><br/>Virtualių vizitų metu elgesio valdymas priklauso tik nuo jūsų. Aš dažnai nematau, kas tiksliai vyksta, todėl prašau įsitraukti, jei reikia. Jei yra didelis sutrikimas, tiesiog paprašykite manęs palaukti, kad aš nekalbėčiau, kol niekas nekreipia dėmesio:>)<br/><br/>Jauskitės laisvai fotografuoti mane ekrane ir dalintis socialinės žiniasklaidos-nors nuotraukos man dažnai atrodo juokinga, nes aš darau juokingas veidus ar kažką, o aš skaityti!<br/><br/>Jei turite kokių nors klausimų, prašome tiesiog paklausti, prieš arba per vizitą!<br/><br/>Virtualios sesijos planavimas<br/><br/>Susidomėjote planuodami virtualų vizitą su manimi? Tiesiog rašykite man, kad nustatytumėte datą, ir mes eisime iš ten |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Naujienų archyvas<br/><br/>Nauja knyga ieško būdų, kaip kovoti su ŽIV iššūkiais<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Profesorius Dennis Francis su Marjorie Human, kuris sukūrė knygos viršelį, veikdamas su ŽIV.<br/><br/>ŽIV pandemija išryškino geriausią ir blogiausią atsaką žmonėms.

| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Vaiduoklių spąstų poveikio mėlynajam krabui, Callinectis Sapidus, Barnegat įlankoje testavimo stenograma<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine lauko metodai2008 m. rugsėjo 16 d.<br/><br/>Aš nusprendžiau naudoti mėlynąjį krabą, Callinectus sapidus, savo eksperimentui, nes jis yra gausus čia Barnegat įlankoje ir yra gana lengva sugauti.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus yra plaukimo krabas Svarbus komerciniams minkštakūniams krabams, tiek komerciniams, tiek rekreaciniams (Jivoff 2008)Pagrindinis krabų gaudymo būdas yra pagrindinis krabų spąstai<br/><br/>Vaiduoklių spąstai atsiranda, kai spąstai prarandami, tačiau vis dar sugauna organizmus (Breen, 1990)John Wnek sako, kad Barnegat įlankoje lengvai yra 2000, nes C. sapidus yra toks agresyvus (Pollock 1998) , kas atsitinka, kai jie įstrigo narve be maisto ir kokį poveikį tai turi?<br/><br/>Jei pateks į vaiduoklių spąstus, C. sapidus turės kanibalizmo tendencijas, kol paskutinis mirs nuo bado.<br/><br/>Kaip mes dubliuoti vaiduoklis spąstus laboratorijoje?Sukurti vaiduoklis spąstus uždarant įėjimus su vielos tinkleliu ir zip raišteliaiKai mėginiai yra pakrauti, uždaryti viršuje su zip raišteliai<br/><br/>Krabų įėjimas uždarytas vieliniu tinklu<br/><br/>Krabų gaudyklėWire MeshWire CuttersVirtuvėCameraZip kaklaraiščiai<br/><br/>Kaip mes gauname krabus?Gaudykite keletą dienų anksčiau ir badaukite juosPasiruošę pradėti, surinkite naujus krabus iš spąstųPridėti tiesiai į vaiduoklių spąstus su 2 iš badaujančio rezervuaro<br/><br/>Šeši krabai iš viso, vienas trūkstaRasta maža erdvė pabėgti dėl; lopas su užtrauktuku kaklaraištisDu krabai miręsVienas tiesiog turi nagai likoKiti trūksta tiek irklai ir vienas letena<br/><br/>Keturi krabai gyvi ir nepažeistiDidesnis negyvas krabas neturi pokyčiųMažesnis negyvas krabas turi tik dalį karapiko liko<br/><br/>Paskutinė eksperimento dienaPaimti du mėginiaiNėra pokyčių nuo antros dienos pirmame mėginyjeAntrasis stebėjimas, didesnis sraigė atskirta nuo likusio kūno/nago<br/><br/>Remdamasis rezultatais, atmetu savo nulinę hipotezę, kad krabai bus tiesiog spąstuose.

Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Nuo 1996 m., kai Lara Kroft pirmą kartą pasirodė filme „Tomb Raider“, jos, kaip nuotykių ieškotojos ir greito proto tyrinėtojos, žygdarbiai plačiai rezonavo su žaidėjais, uždirbdami jai vietą didžiųjų popkultūros veikėjų panteone. Dėl šios priežasties „The World of Lara Croft“ bus „Storyworld“ dėmesio centre nuo 2021 m. Gruodžio 22 d. Iki 2022 m.

Žaidimas trečiojo asmens perspektyvos, kur žaidėjai galėtų pamatyti pagrindinis veikėjas visiškai per kiekvieną sceną.<br/><br/>Kadangi žaidimas buvo apie "paleisti paslaptingas kapų giliai po piramidėmis", pagrindinis personažas turėtų atrodyti drąsus, ir turėti smegenis išgyventi sudėtingas reiding misijas. Po tam tikrų svarstymų Lara Croft gimė, jauna, aukštesnės klasės ir visiškai britų moteris, kuri buvo tokia pat paslaptinga ir protinga, kaip ir ji buvo griežta ir pasitikinti savimi.<br/><br/>Sėkmė ir kontroversijos<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) buvo atsiskyrusi sėkmė Core Design, kuris greitai padvigubėjo pastačius Tomb Raider 2 (1997) ir 3 (1998).

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Nekilnojamasis turtas Dienos žodis: pasirinkimas<br/><br/>Pasirinkimas: susitarimas tam tikrą laikotarpį palikti pasiūlymą parduoti arba išnuomoti nekilnojamąjį turtą. Pasirinkimas gali būti naudojamas, pavyzdžiui, siekiant suteikti pirkėjui laiko išspręsti finansavimo, pavadinimo, zonavimo ir galimybių klausimus prieš įsipareigojant pirkėjui pirkti. Galimybės dažnai naudojamos žemės surinkimo procese. Pasirinkimas turi būti pagrįstas faktiniu atlygiu, atskirtu ir nepriklausomu nuo turto pirkimo kainos. Vien tik konstatuojamosios dalies nepakanka, išskyrus nuomos galimybę, kai nuomos nuostatos yra pakankamai apsvarstytos, kad būtų galima remtis šia galimybe.

| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Karotenoidų nauda odai<br/><br/>Ar girdėjote apie karotinoidus? Šie galingi fitochemikalai yra pigmentinės sudedamosios dalys, randamos augaluose, kurie suteikia gėlių, vaisių ir palieka savo geltoną, oranžinę ir raudoną spalvą.<br/><br/>Nuo 1930 m. Mokslininkai nustatė apie 800 karotinoidų ir apie 40 randama žmogaus organizme, įskaitant išorinį epidermio sluoksnį, dermą ir poodinius riebalus. Dažniausiai karotinoidai yra beta-karotinas, alfa-karotinas, liuteinas, zeaksantinas, likopenas ir astaksantinas. Daugiau apie astaksantiną galite skaityti čia.<br/><br/>Karotinoidų kiekis odoje priklauso nuo daugelio veiksnių, įskaitant vaisių ir daržovių suvartojimą, jų biologinį prieinamumą iš įvairių maisto produktų, papildų, UV spindulių poveikio, oro taršos, alkoholio vartojimo, rūkymo ir streso.<br/><br/>Kaip karotinoidai padeda mano odai?<br/><br/>Karotinoidai yra vieni iš geriausiai žinomų antioksidantų odai ir jie taip pat atlieka svarbias funkcijas kaip priešuždegiminiai agentai.<br/><br/>Sveikas senėjimas ir odos remontas<br/><br/>Antioksidantai yra būtini sveikai odai, nes jie padeda išvengti laisvųjų radikalų žalos ląstelėms. Laisvųjų radikalų žala sukelia priešlaikinį senėjimą ir įvairių tipų odos vėžio atsiradimą. Karotinoidai, kartu su vitaminu E, vitaminu C ir kofermentu Q10, yra svarbūs odos antioksidantai.<br/><br/>Dėl savo antioksidacinio aktyvumo karotinoidai palaiko ir skatina kolageno ir elastino gamybą odoje. Tai padeda padidinti odos tankį, storį, elastingumą ir tvirtumą. Kolagenas ir elastinas mažėja, kaip mes amžiaus, todėl gauti pakankamai karotinoidų dietos ir lokaliai yra labai svarbus senėjimo gerai.<br/><br/>Karotinoidai gali pagerinti fotosenėjimo, odos spalvos pasikeitimo, elastingumo, hidratacijos, tekstūros požymius ir gali sumažinti transepiderminį vandens praradimą.<br/><br/>Astaksantinas ypač stimuliuoja fibroblastus gaminti kolageną ir elastiną, slopina fermentų, kurie skaido kolageną ir elastiną, aktyvumą ir rodo priešuždegiminį ir UV filtravimo poveikį. Įrodyta, kad odoje sumažėja melaninas, dėl kurio sumažėja strazdanų ir melasmos išvaizda.<br/><br/>Anti-spuogų aktyvumas: karotinoidų priešuždegiminis aktyvumas padeda sušvelninti su spuogais susijusį uždegimą ir dirginimą. Karotenoidai taip pat padeda normalizuoti ir subalansuoti aliejaus sekreciją iš riebalinių liaukų. Jie yra vertingi odos remonto agentai ir stimuliuoja epidermio regeneraciją, padeda išlyginti ir suminkštinti odą.<br/><br/>Kur galiu rasti karotinoidų?<br/><br/>Yra du būdai, kaip gauti kasdienę karotinoidų dozę: per dietą ir per vietinį naudojimą. Abiejų derinys yra idealus požiūris į senstančią odos priežiūrą.<br/><br/>Karotinoidai yra tirpūs riebaluose, todėl jūsų organizmui reikia riebalų, kad juos absorbuotų (galvokite apie pomidorus ir alyvuogių aliejų, brokolius ir sviestą arba špinatus ir avokadus). Įprasti karotinoidų šaltiniai maiste yra avokadai, kiaušinių tryniai, kopūstai, špinatai, morkos, saldžiosios bulvės, papajos ir pomidorai.<br/><br/>Nors mes pasisakome už tai, kad gautumėte kuo daugiau maistinių medžiagų ir antioksidantų iš maisto, o ne papildų; vienas tyrimas parodė, kad astaksantinas kartu su kolagenu hidrolizuoja žymiai pagerino barjero vientisumą, sumažino transepiderminį vandens praradimą ir padidino I tipo mRNR išraišką.<br/><br/>Tyrimai rodo, kad didelės antioksidantų koncentracijos žmogaus odoje suteikia geriausią apsaugą sveikai odai bet kokiame amžiuje.<br/><br/>Tuo Sarka Botanicals, mes mišinys karotinoidų turtingas, sveiki augalai, pavyzdžiui, medetkų, kiaulpienių, ir ekstraktai, pavyzdžiui, astaksantino su šalto spaudimo aliejų ir funkcinių ingredientų. Vien tik medetkų yra daugiau nei 19 skirtingų rūšių karotinoidų. Tai gali paaiškinti, kodėl jis taip ilgai naudojamas odos priežiūrai. Tyrimai rodo, kad karotinoidai, sumaišyti su kofermentu Q10, yra ypač veiksmingi mažinant uždegimą ir lėtinant ankstyvą odos senėjimą dėl saulės poveikio. |
