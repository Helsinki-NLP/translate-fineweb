In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Internetinis CPR sertifikavimo tinklaraštis<br/><br/>Data: 2014 m. liepos 23 d.<br/><br/>Autosominė dominuojanti intersticinė inkstų liga yra retų ligų, turinčių įtakos žinomoms inkstų funkcijoms, rinkinys.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbeso ir Locke’o ataskaita apie gamtos būklę<br/><br/>Tema: FilosofijaŽodžiai: 2539Puslapiai: 9Rugpjūtis 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbesas ir Locke'as yra vieni įtakingiausių kada nors anglų kalba rašiusių filosofų. Gamtos būklė, kuri yra prieš sudėtingų visuomenių organizavimą, yra bendra prielaida, kurią Hobbesas ir Locke'as dalijasi, bet skirtingai interpretuoja. Pirmieji žmones jų natūralioje būsenoje laiko lygiai taip pat pavojingais ir laisvais siekti savo egoistinių tikslų, nevaržomais neegzistuojančių teisingumo sampratų, todėl jų natūrali būsena prilygsta „kiekvieno žmogaus karui su kitu žmogumi“ (Hobbes, 76). Kita vertus, pastaroji žmonių pirminę būklę laiko vienodai vertinga ir apriboja prigimtinę laisvę teisingumo idėja, reikalaujančia nekenkti kitiems, o tai leidžia gamtos būklę apibrėžti kaip „abipusę pagalbą ir išsaugojimą“, o ne kaip karą (Locke, 15). Pagrindinis skirtumas tarp dviejų filosofų pasakojimų apie natūralią būseną yra tas, kad Locke'as naudoja etinius aspektus, o Hobbesas - ne, ir tai galiausiai skatina Hobbesą įsivaizduoti valstybę, turinčią neribotą galią žmonėms, o Locke riboja vyriausybę moraliniais principais, kuriuos jis laiko natūraliu įstatymu.<br/><br/>Hobbesas savo prielaidas apie gamtos būklę grindžia tuo, kad visi žmonės yra maždaug lygūs savo fiziniais ir protiniais sugebėjimais. Jis pripažįsta, kad kai kurie individai gali pademonstruoti didesnę fizinę jėgą ar aukštesnį intelektą, tačiau tvirtina, kad „kai viskas suskaičiuojama kartu, skirtumas tarp žmogaus ir žmogaus nėra toks didelis“ (Hobbes 74). Kadangi žmonės yra maždaug lygūs savo sugebėjimais, jie taip pat turi panašių vilčių pasiekti savo tikslus ir patenkinti savo poreikius (Hobbes 75). Kaip logiška šios lygybės pasekmė, kai žmonės pradeda varžytis dėl ribotų išteklių, niekas negali jaustis visiškai saugus savo nuosavybe. Net jei galingas, gudrus ir gabus žmogus sugeba pavergti „visų žmonių, kuriuos tik gali, asmenis“, tai vis tiek negarantuoja galutinio saugumo (Hobbesas, 75). Kadangi nė vienas žmogus negali įgyti tokio pranašumo prieš kitus, kad taptų visiškai imunitetu jų intelekto jėgoms, nė vienas žmogus negali jaustis visiškai saugus, kai yra apsuptas savo lygių. Hobbeso lygybė natūralioje būsenoje yra baimės lygybė, kai visi žmonės laiko vienas kitą pavojingais konkurentais.<br/><br/>Kaip ir Hobbesas, Locke mano, kad visi žmonės iš esmės yra lygūs, tačiau terminui priskiria labai skirtingą reikšmę. Jo požiūriu, tai nėra galimybių lygybė, o vertės lygybė. Jis mano, kad žmonės, „palaidai gimę visiems gamtos privalumams“, logiškai turėtų mėgautis tobula lygybe tarp jų, nes nėra jokios priežasties laikyti ką nors savaime vertingesniu (Locke 8). Vienintelė galimybė kai kuriuos žmones laikyti pranašesniais už kitus būtų, jei Dievas „aiškia savo valios išraiška iškeltų vieną virš kito“ (Locke, 8). Kadangi tokios dieviškos viršenybės sankcijos nėra, Locke‘as daro išvadą, kad natūrali visų žmonijos atstovų lygybė neginčijama. Hobbesas pragmatiškai vertina lygybę ir pabrėžia, kad žmonės jų natūralioje būsenoje yra vienodai pavojingi, tačiau Locke‘as taiko etišką požiūrį ir pabrėžia, kad žmonės yra vienodai vertingi Dievo akyse. Šis nesutarimas yra tik pirmasis skirtumas tarp dviejų autorių, pagrįstas tuo, kad Locke į savo politinę filosofiją įtraukia Dievą kaip prielaidą, o Hobbesas - ne.<br/><br/>Kita būdinga Hobbeso pasakojimo apie natūralią būseną ypatybė yra jo laisvės interpretacija. Pasak Hobbeso, gamtos būklė reiškia neribotą laisvę daryti viską, kas reikalinga tolesniam egzistavimui. Filosofas apibrėžia laisvę kaip „išorinių kliūčių nebuvimą“ naudojant savo sugebėjimus savo tikslams pasiekti (Hobbes 79). Kiekvienos jaučiančios būtybės pagrindinis tikslas yra išlaikyti savo tęstinį egzistavimą. Todėl Hobbeso laisvė prilygsta nekliudomai galimybei daryti viską, kas, jo manymu, geriausiai padėtų išsaugoti gyvybę ir turtą (Hobbesas, 79). Vienintelis laisvės apribojimas yra tai, kad žmogus negali daryti nieko, kas prieštarautų jo ar jos gyvybės palaikymui ar „to paties išsaugojimo priemonių“ griovimui (Hobbesas, 79). Be to, nėra jokių ribų ir kiekvienas turi „teisę į viską, net į vienas kito kūną“, jei tai padeda jam išlikti (Hobbesas, 80). Taigi, prigimtinė laisvė, kaip matė Hobbesas, yra išorinių kliūčių nebuvimas, siekiant įgyvendinti savo teisę į viską, kad palaikytų ir užtikrintų savo tolesnį egzistavimą.<br/><br/>Locke taip pat palaiko natūralios laisvės idėją, tačiau nenuostabu, kad požiūris į ją labai skiriasi nuo Hobbeso. Kai tik jis pradeda diskutuoti apie laisvę gamtos būsenoje, jis iš karto pažymi, kad laisvės būsena neprilygsta „licencijų būsenai“ (Locke 9). Filosofas nustato du konkrečius žmogaus laisvės apribojimus gamtos būsenoje. Pirmasis yra identiškas tam, kurį įvedė Hobbesas: kad ir koks laisvas ir nepriklausomas žmogus vis dėlto „neturi laisvės save sunaikinti“ (Locke 9), tačiau antrasis apribojimas tiesiogiai prieštarauja Hobbeso prielaidoms. Anot Locke‘o, kiekvienas žmogus turi prigimtinę pareigą „nekenkti kitam savo gyvenime, savo sveikatai, savo laisvei ar savo nuosavybei“ (9). Savo lygybės aiškinimu autorius grindžia šį teiginį etiniais ir religiniais motyvais: žmonės turi saugoti vienas kito egzistenciją, nes visi jie yra to paties „galingo ir be galo išmintingo kūrinio“ (Locke, 9) kūriniai. Tokiu būdu Locke’o laisvė natūralioje būsenoje apribojama daug griežčiau nei Hobbeso, įvedant pareigą susilaikyti nuo žalos sau ir kitiems.<br/><br/>Skirtumai tarp dviejų autorių taip pat pasireiškia jų pasakojimuose apie teisingumą natūralioje žmonijos būsenoje. Kiek tai susiję su Hobbesu, teisingos ir neteisingos praktikos apibrėžimas yra tik įstatymo reikalas. Gamtos būklėje nėra jurisprudencijos, ir vienintelis įstatymas, valdantis žmones jų pirminėje būklėje, yra prigimtinis įstatymas, įpareigojantis juos siekti tik asmeninio saugumo. Todėl niekas negali būti neteisingas pirminėje žmonijos būklėje: „teisingumo ir neteisingumo sąvokos“ neturi nei vietos, nei prasmės, jei nėra griežtai taikomo įstatymo (Hobbes 78). Tol, kol žmonės naudojasi praktiškai neribota laisve negailestingai varžytis tarpusavyje dėl išteklių, į kuriuos jie turi lygias teises, jie neturi kriterijų, pagal kuriuos galėtų atskirti teisingus ir neteisingus veiksmus. Todėl Hobbeso gamtos būklė meta iššūkį pačiai teisingumo idėjai, nes autorius ją interpretuoja kaip paprastą formalizuoto ir įtvirtinto įstatymo funkciją.<br/><br/>Locke’as teisingumui suteikia kitokią prasmę ir į jį žiūri ne tiek įstatymiškai, kiek etiškai. Šiame darbe jau buvo paminėta, kad, skirtingai nuo Hobbeso, Locke‘as naudoja etines sąvokas ir savo politinę filosofiją paprastai grindžia moralinėmis, o ne grynai praktinėmis prielaidomis. Locke'o prigimtinis įstatymas, skirtingai nuo Hobbeso, įpareigoja žmones rūpintis vienas kitu, o ne tiesiog leisti visiems kovoti už save. Dėl to jo gamtos būklėje yra vieta teisingumui ir neteisybei. Autorius pats nurodo šį faktą, pažymėdamas, kad niekas neturėtų atimti iš kito savo gyvenimo priemonių, kad jį išsaugotų, „nebent tai būtų teisingumas nusikaltėlio atžvilgiu“ (Locke, 9). Šis teiginys labai aiškiai atskleidžia, kad, pasak Locke'o, gamtos būklėje yra teisingumas, be to, žmonės turi aktyviai jį išsaugoti. Teisingumo kriterijus, kurio trūksta Hobbeso prigimtinei valstybei, yra Locke primestas antrasis prigimtinės laisvės apribojimas: veiksmas yra neteisingas, jei jis kelia nepagrįstą grėsmę kito asmens gyvenimui ir nuosavybei.<br/><br/>Šie dviejų autorių požiūrio į lygybę, laisvę ir teisingumą ar neteisybę skirtumai kulminaciją pasiekia aiškindami santykį tarp gamtos būklės ir karo būklės. Hobbeso požiūriu, abu yra sinonimai, nes negailestinga konkurencija yra vienintelis logiškas rezultatas, kai žmonės, turintys lygiavertes galimybes ir panašius poreikius, patenka į ribotų išteklių aplinką. Jis aiškiai nurodo šį ryšį: „Jei du žmonės trokšta to paties dalyko, kuriuo abu negali mėgautis, jie tampa priešais“ ir todėl kariauja vienas su kitu (Hobbesas, 75). Tačiau kadangi žmonių yra daug ir visi turi panašias galimybes bei poreikius, ši konkurencija pasireiškia ne tik individualiomis sąveikomis, bet ir visos žmonijos lygmeniu. Tol, kol visi žmonės turi lygias ir neribotas teises į visus išteklius ir net į vienas kito kūnus bei gyvybes, gamtos būklė yra „kiekvieno žmogaus karas su kitu žmogumi“ (Hobbes, 76). Šis niūrus aiškinimas tiesiogiai kyla iš Hobbeso gamtos būklės, kurią valdo tik individų egoistiniai postūmiai, vaizdavimo.<br/><br/>Locke, kita vertus, atskiria gamtos būklę ir karo būklę ir nurodo, kad nors jie gali atsirasti vienu metu, tai nėra priežastis identifikuoti vieną su kitu. Locke'o karo padėties apibrėžimas yra beveik identiškas Hobbeso pasiūlytam. Pasak Locke'o, "tas, kuris bando gauti kitą žmogų į savo absoliučią galią, taip pat patenka į karo būklę su juo" (14). Šis paaiškinimas puikiai dera su Hobbeso idėja, kad visuotinė kiekvieno teisė į viską, įskaitant kitų žmonių kūnus ir gyvenimus, veda į karo būseną. Tačiau Locke‘as atsisako lyginti karo ir gamtos būklę būtent dėl to, kad jis neigia Hobbeso prigimtinės laisvės interpretaciją. Kadangi Locke’o prigimtinė būsena neleidžia žmonėms kenkti vienas kitam per antrąjį laisvės apribojimą, bandymas kėsintis į kito asmens laisvę yra prigimtinio įstatymo pažeidimas. Nors Hobbesui karas yra žmonijos būklė pagal nutylėjimą, Locke jį vaizduoja kaip gamtos būklės iškraipymą, o ne jos taisyklę.<br/><br/>Šie skirtumai apibrėžiant valstybę apie gamtą ir jos sudedamąsias dalis, tokias kaip laisvė, lygybė, teisingumas ir karas, nutiesia kelią autoriams kontrastingiems vyriausybės vaizdiniams. Remdamasis savo pesimistiniu gamtos būklės vertinimu, Leviatanas daro išvadą, kad karo sąlygomis negali būti aiškios vilties „išgyventi laiko, kurį gamta paprastai leidžia žmonėms gyventi“ (Hobbesas, 80). Sprendimas yra nustatyti visuotinę teisę į viską ir palikti kiekvienam „tokią laisvę kitų žmonių atžvilgiu, kokią jis suteiktų kitiems žmonėms prieš save patį“ (Hobbes, 80). Susidariusios visuomeninės sutarties dalyviai atiduotas neribotas laisves investuoja į suvereną – aukščiausiosios galios nešėją, kurio tikslas yra išsaugoti pasiektą status quo, nubausdami už visus jam priešingus nusižengimus. Valdovo galia yra absoliuti: valdovas turi galią „daryti viską, kas jam atrodo būtina“, kad tarp savo pavaldinių vyrautų taika ir niekas nepultų kito gyvybės ar nuosavybės [113]. Hobbesas daro išvadą, kad be tokios nepalaužiamos figūros, turinčios teisę ką nors daryti su subjektais, negali būti taikos ir saugumo garantijos.<br/><br/>Nors Locke‘as sutinka su būtinybe kurti politiškai organizuotas visuomenes, jis vis dėlto priešinasi Hobbes‘o idėjai, kad suvereni valdžia yra neribota ir nesustabdoma. Kaip minėta, Locke'o gamtos būklė nėra beveik tokia baisi, kaip ir Hobso, nes žmonės privalo išsaugoti ne tik save, bet ir vienas kitą. Todėl socialinio susitarimo poreikis kyla ne iš kitų baimės, bet iš gryno patogumo. Mažoms bendruomenėms gali neprireikti daugybės įstatymų, kad išspręstų konfliktus, o „pareigūnai prižiūrėtų procesą“, tačiau didesnėms asociacijoms patartina šiuo tikslu įsteigti vyriausybes (Locke 57). Tačiau valdžios galia negali būti neribota, nes tai reikštų, kad subjektai būtų pajungiami „nuolatinei, neaiškiai, nežinomai, savavališkai kito žmogaus valiai“ (Locke 17). Tokia vyriausybė būtų dvigubas prigimtinio įstatymo pažeidimas. Sutikdamas su kito asmens absoliučia valdžia savo gyvenime, subjektas pažeistų savo pirmąjį apribojimą, draudžiantį sau pakenkti. Kalbant apie valdovą, kito asmens laisvės sunaikinimas būtų tiesioginė žala ir kaip tokia prieštarautų antrajam apribojimui.<br/><br/>Tiesiogiai tęsdamas savo bylą dėl neribotos valdžios, Hobbesas neigia valdžių atskyrimą kaip principą. Jo požiūriu, įsteigtas suverenas turi „visą galią nustatyti taisykles“, valdančias subjektų gyvenimą, arba, trumpiau tariant, įstatymų leidžiamąją galią (Hobbs 114). Suverenitetas taip pat pasilieka teisę „išklausyti ir išspręsti visus ginčus“ – tai yra teisminę valdžią (Hobbs 114). Galiausiai, kadangi visas suvereno tikslas yra priversti subjektus nekenkti vienas kitam, negali būti jokių abejonių, kad vykdomoji valdžia taip pat yra jo išimtinė prerogatyva. Valdžių atskyrimas kaip koncepcija yra svetimas Hobbesui dėl jo požiūrio į gamtos būklę. Įsteigti politinį subjektą, kuriame vykdomosios, įstatymų leidžiamosios ir teisminės valdžios atstovai tikrintų vienas kitą, t. y. konkuruotų, reikštų atkurti Hobbeso gamtos-kaip karo būseną aukštesniame lygmenyje. Kadangi žmonės sudaro socialinę sutartį ir įsteigia vyriausybę, kad gamtos būklė būtų už jų, o ne atkurti ją kitokia forma, valdžių atskyrimas tiesiogiai prieštarauja Hobbeso nuomonėms.<br/><br/>Locke, kita vertus, apima valdžios atskyrimą kaip pagrindinį jo politinės teorijos principą. Jo atskyrimo argumentas yra akivaizdus diskusijose apie įstatymų leidžiamosios valdžios ribas. Locke’as sako, jog vargu ar būtų patartina „tiems patiems asmenims, kurie turi galią leisti įstatymus, turėti savo rankose galią juos vykdyti“ [76]. Filosofas atkreipia dėmesį į žmogaus prigimties netobulumus ir į įgimtą troškimą „sugriebti valdžią“ kaip į šios atsargumo priemonės loginį pagrindą (Locke 76). Kaip ir Hobso atveju, Locke’o pasakojimas apie valdžių atskyrimą tiesiogiai kyla iš jo gamtos būklės interpretacijos. Jei gamtos būklėje jau yra teisingumas ir žmonės gali jį suprasti, tai bet kuri vyriausybė neišvengiamai paklūsta tam pačiam prigimtiniam įstatymui. Kadangi absoliuti valdžia žmonėms pažeidžia abu šio įstatymo apribojimus, patartina ją atskirti ir paskirstyti taip, kad vyriausybė tinkamai veiktų.<br/><br/>Šis darbas parodė, kad, nors skirtumai tarp Hobso ir Loko pasakojimų apie natūralią žmonijos būklę yra daug, jie galiausiai prilygsta moralinių prielaidų nebuvimui. Hobbesas natūralią būseną laiko neribotos laisvės būsena, kurioje žmonės, apdovanoti lygiomis galimybėmis ir neturintys jokių moralinių sąvokų, tokių kaip teisingumas, nuolat konkuruoja dėl išteklių. Tačiau Locke‘as lygybę ir laisvę aiškina etiškai, o ne praktiškai, ir mano, kad karas yra natūralios būsenos iškraipymas, nes prigimtinis įstatymas įpareigoja žmones nekenkti vienas kitam. Šis nesutarimas daro įtaką filosofų požiūriui į valdžią. Hobbesas primygtinai reikalauja visagalio valdovo, nes, nesant etinių apribojimų, jokia kita institucija negalėjo priversti žmones susilaikyti nuo žalos vienas kitam. Tačiau, Locke‘o nuomone, neribotų galių suteikimas vyriausybei prieštarautų gamtos dėsniuose glūdintiems etiniams apribojimams, todėl jis, skirtingai nei Hobsas, pasisako už valdžių atskyrimą. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Mados policija: koks sostų žaidimas buvo išmestas<br/><br/>Kanados-Prancūzijos dainininkas Abbas Hasan įdėti akinanti pastangas pranokti visą žmoniją mados paradas 2014. Nieko blogo su, kad, išskyrus saugumą yra prioritetas ir muzikantas yra pavojus sveikatai čia.<br/><br/>Mes gauname, kad jis nori būti žvaigžde. Deja, jis negavo užrašų, kuriuose sakoma, kad beviltiška ir liūdna, kad žvaigždė yra metafora. Jūs neturite atrodyti kaip vienas ir pažodžiui nustatyti mūsų regėjimą. Be to, "All Pakistan Aunty Association" oficialiai pateikė skundą prieš jį. Vietinė rinka išdžiūvo iš padirbtų kristalų ir blizgančių monstrų. Jie neturi nieko dėvėti savo du kartus per savaitę aukštų arbatų ir jie teigia, kad jis yra kaltas. Atrodo, kad apranga įkvėpta „Sostų karų“ žaidimo. Ar jis gali, užuot konceptualizavęs aprangą, rašyti liūdnas dainas apie savo kaimyno negyvą šunį? O gal tai yra prarasti šunį trauma, kurio mirtis yra aiškiai ne daugiau, kaip jis vis dar dėvi savo skerdeną.<br/><br/>Įkrovimo lapas Apranga<br/><br/>Niekas negali nuspręsti, kur prasideda apranga ir kur baigiasi Abbasas. Jūs žiūrite į susižavėjimą, nuskendo į gilią bedugnę ir įdomu, kodėl jis dėvi odines kelnes. Kieno arklį jis nužudė, kad pavogtų balną, padengtą per pečius? Ar jis buvo kalėjime prieš pat savo raudoną kilimą ir pamiršo nuimti grandines? Kaip jis išgyvens sintetinę odą ir po bėrimo bėrimą, kuris privalo būti mirtinas tokiomis didelėmis dozėmis? Kodėl aš vis dar gyvas?<br/><br/>Idėja<br/><br/>Jo įkvėpimas, matyt, buvo "Sostų žaidimas", bet galiausiai jis atrodė, kad jis buvo išmestas iš vikingų restorano. Jei jis būtų susidūręs su bet kuriuo iš šou personažų, jis būtų nužudytas per pirmąsias penkias pirmojo epizodo sekundes.<br/><br/>Psichikos sveikata ar jos trūkumas: Kažkas jį į patarėją ASAP! Atrodo, kad jis yra pagal prielaidą, kad dėvėti miręs šuo reiškia, kad vienintelis draugas jis turėjo savo gyvenime vis dar gyvas.<br/><br/>1. Neigimas nėra upė Egipte<br/><br/>2. Jūsų kankinta psichika nepadeda jūsų muzikai, todėl gaukite pagalbos<br/><br/>3. Išbandykite įsivaizduojamus draugus<br/><br/>Šok lauk!<br/><br/>Mes visi mados policijos būstinėje yra labai traumuoti. Abbasas yra tas, kuris mums nepatiko areštas. Jis šiuo metu yra suimtas ir bando keršto, pateikdamas drabužius iš kitų fantazijos šou. Jis tiesiog blizgučiai klijuoti save, kad atrodytų kaip Edward Cullen iš Twilight. Kaip viešųjų paslaugų pranešimą ir užkirsti kelią tolesniam nervų suskirstymui, mes davėme jam šiuos pavyzdžius vyrų iš to paties renginio raudonojo kilimo.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Kai kyla abejonių, žaisti saugiai. Dainininkas atrodo kaip jūsų vidutinis dėdė Shaadi. Paprastas juodas kostiumas be priedų, net jei jis yra neproporcingas. Zohaibo išvaizda yra sumaišyta į viską ir nieką, o kai neturite mados jausmo ar pinigų samdyti stilistą, tai gerai. Tai nekelia širdies sustojimo rizikos kitiems renginio dalyviams. Atsižvelgiant į subtilią Abbaso psichinę būklę, šis žvilgsnis yra tai, ko jis turėtų siekti. Visada ir amžinai.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Vieną dieną, po dešimtmečius trukusios terapijos, Abbasas gali norėti vilkėti tokius drabužius kaip Ali Zafar. Ali labai priartėjo prie to, kad atrodytų kaip prancūzų restorano meistras su savo balta vasaros striuke su juodais atlapais, bet marškinėliai jį išsaugo, nesvarbu satinas. Jo kelnės būtų juokingos, jei jos nebūtų sulankstytos ties kulkšnimi. Batai yra tai, ką hipster elegantiškas laimingas galūnės yra pagaminti iš. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Dirvožemio hidraulinių savybių nustatymas su skirtingais drėkinimo skysčiais : disertacija, pateikta iš dalies vykdant Lincoln University magistro laipsnio reikalavimus<br/><br/>Abstraktus<br/><br/>Dirvožemio hidraulinės savybės, tokios kaip hidraulinis laidumas, vandens sulaikymas ir augalų vandens santykiai, dominuoja vandens judėjimo procesuose. Pavyzdžiui, infiltracija, garavimas ir vandens srautas dirvožemyje. Kaip plačiai paplitęs reiškinys dirvožemyje, dirvožemio vandens atbaidymas keičia dirvožemio hidraulines funkcijas, nes atsparus vandens srautui į dirvožemį. Be to, hidraulinės savybės priklauso ne tik nuo dirvožemio porų sistemos, bet ir nuo porų paviršių fizikinių ir cheminių savybių. Palyginti su vandeniu, etanolis neturi įtakos vandens atbaidymui dėl mažesnės paviršiaus įtampos. Etanolio naudojimo tikslas yra pašalinti dirvožemio vandens atbaidymo poveikį hidraulinių savybių matavimams. Tačiau gryno etanolio naudojimas natūraliame dirvožemyje gali suskaidyti dirvožemio organines medžiagas ir sukelti fizinių savybių pokyčius. Todėl vandeniniai etanolio tirpalai gali būti alternatyvus variantas, tačiau galimybė naudoti vandeninį etanolį dirvožemio skysčių sulaikymo kreivei nustatyti vis dar nežinoma. Šio tyrimo tikslas – patikrinti vandeninių etanolio tirpalų (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % ir 100 % v/v) tinkamumą skysčio sulaikymo kreivei nustatyti esant nedideliam slėgiui šiurkščiavilnių smėlių ėminiuose, kurių drėgmingumas yra skirtingas, ir organiškai modifikuotame natūraliame dirvožemyje (Templeton dumblas (TSL) su grybų kompostu, bioanglimiu, pieno nuotekomis ir komunos kompostu). Rezultatai parodė, kad bandomųjų vandeninių etanolio tirpalų desorbcija, palyginti su vandeniu, buvo maždaug 1–3 kartus greitesnė, atsižvelgiant į skysčio kiekį esant tam pačiam slėgiui ir kiekvienos pusiausvyros pasiekimo laiką. Smėlio eksperimento rezultatai parodė, kad kai vandeninio etanolio tirpalo koncentracija buvo mažesnė nei 50 %, nuostoliai dėl garavimo buvo mažesni nei 1 %, o santykiniai skirtumai tarp bandymo skysčio ir vandens buvo mažesni nei 10 %. Tačiau garavimo nuostoliai buvo 11,06 % ir 24,6 %, o santykiniai skirtumai buvo maždaug 15 % ir 30 % atitinkamai 50 % ir 100 % etanolio tirpale. Priešingai, organiniai Templetono dumblo dumblo pakeitimai ne tik padidino vandens sulaikymo galimybes, bet ir sumažino garavimo nuostolius. Garavimo nuostoliai TSL ir TSL dirvožemyje su organinėmis modifikuotomis dirvožemyje buvo 1 % tirpaluose, kuriuose yra mažiau nei 50 % etanolio. Santykiniai skirtumai tarp vandens ir bandomojo skysčio buvo panašūs į smėlio eksperimentą, kai bandomosios skysčio koncentracijos buvo mažesnės nei 50 %. Tačiau santykiniai 50 % ir 100 % etanolio tirpalo skirtumai buvo mažesni nei smėlio mėginio, atitinkamai apie 10 % ir 15 %. Be to, santykinio skirtumo analizė parodė, kad beveik visuose vandeniniuose etanolio tirpaluose buvo mažesnis tūrinis skysčio kiekis esant tam pačiam tiekiamam slėgiui, palyginti su vandeniu, o tai atspindi vandeninius etanolio tirpalus, desorbuotus greičiau nei vanduo esant lygiaverčiam slėgiui. Todėl 10–40 % etanolio tirpalų galėtų būti laikomi alternatyviais dirvožemio hidraulinėms savybėms nustatyti, nes jie greičiau desorbuojasi ir nėra atsparūs vandeniui. Dėl organinių medžiagų garavimo ir ištirpinimo vandeniniai etanolio tirpalai, kurių koncentracija viršija 50%, nebuvo tinkami šiurkščiavilnių smėlio ar vidutinės tekstūros dirvožemiui....
