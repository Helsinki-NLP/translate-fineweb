| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>2015 m. lapkritis 19 d.<br/>Paskelbė Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa yra daugiametis augalas, kuris klesti pelkėtose subtropikų ir atogrąžų regionuose visame pasaulyje. Labai vertinamas žolė yra pagrindinis ingredientas Doxiderol, maisto papildas, kuris pagerina pažinimo funkciją. Bacopa buvo pasirinktas dėl savo gebėjimo apsaugoti smegenis ir padidinti acetilcholino, biocheminis pasiuntinys, kuris leidžia nervų sistemą perduoti informaciją.<br/><br/>Ajurvedos praktikai pirmą kartą aprašė Bacopa terapines savybes 300 m. Pr. Kr. Gydytojai įrašė Bacopa sugebėjimus pagerinti intelektą ir atmintį. Praėjus beveik 2500 metų, vis daugiau šiuolaikinių tyrimų patvirtina kognityvinę Bacopa naudą, įrašytą Ajurvedos tekste.<br/><br/>1987 m. Indijos mokslininkai įvertino bacopos poveikį mokyklinio amžiaus vaikų intelektinei funkcijai. Per keturių savaičių tyrimą jie davė bacopa 40 vaikų, kurie buvo nuo 6 iki 8 metų. Mokslininkai nustatė, kad Bacopa padidino suvokimą ir atmintį. Vaikai sugebėjo išspręsti labirintą pratimus greičiau ir tiksliau po to, kai gavo Bacopa. Daugelis Indijos tėvų reguliariai naudoja bacopa, kad pagerintų savo vaikų intelektinį vystymąsi.<br/><br/>2001 m. Rugpjūčio mėn. Psichofarmakologijos numeryje paskelbtas 12 savaičių tyrimas ištyrė bacopa poveikį pažinimo funkcijai. Mokslininkai atsitiktinai priskyrė sveikus savanorius nuo 18 iki 65 metų, kad gautų bacopa arba neaktyvią medžiagą. Jie taip pat naudojo dvigubai aklą tyrimo konfigūraciją, kad paslėptų produktų tapatybes. Mokslininkai naudoja šį dizainą, kad užtikrintų, jog bandymų rezultatai yra pagrįsti, nes pašalina tyrėjų ir dalyvių šališkumą. Bacopa grupė žymiai pagerino greitį, kuriuo jie galėjo apdoroti vaizdinę informaciją. Dalyviai taip pat išmoko greičiau ir efektyviau išsaugojo naujus prisiminimus.<br/><br/>2007 m. Teksaso A & M medicinos koledžo laboratorijos tyrimas atskleidė vieną iš mechanizmų, atsakingų už Bacopa gebėjimą skatinti smegenų sveikatą. Pasak mokslininkų, Bacopa naudoja polifenolius, kad išvengtų oksidacinio streso ir žalos, kurią ji sukelia sveikoms smegenų ląstelėms. Bacopa taip pat sumažina kenksmingos medžiagos, vadinamos beta amiloidu, kuris yra pagrindinis Alzheimerio liga sergančių pacientų smegenų apnašų komponentas, nuosėdas.<br/><br/>2008 m. Liepos mėn. Alternatyvios ir papildomos medicinos žurnale paskelbtas dvigubai aklas tyrimas įvertino bacopos poveikį vyresnio amžiaus pacientams. Tyrimas patvirtino, kad bacopa padidino kognityvinę veiklą, tuo pačiu sumažindama stresą. Pasak autorių, šiame tyrime pasiekta nauda patvirtino ankstesnių tyrimų rezultatus.<br/><br/>2008 m. Gruodžio mėn. Paskelbtame „Phytotherapy Research“ numeryje paskelbtas 90 dienų tyrimas patvirtina kognityvinę naudą, kuri anksčiau buvo įrodyta kituose Bacopa tyrimuose. Bacopa žymiai pagerino dalyvių gebėjimą laikinai saugoti ir naudoti informaciją, reikalingą sudėtingai užduočiai atlikti. Dvigubai aklas tyrimas taip pat parodė, kad bacopa sumažino laiką, reikalingą vaizdinei informacijai apdoroti.<br/><br/>Be nervų signalo perdavimo stiprinimo, mokslininkai teigia, kad bacopa padidina pažinimo funkciją, mažindama nerimą. Daugybė tyrimų rodo, kad nerimas trukdo gebėjimui atlikti užduotis, kurioms reikia aukštesnio lygio pažinimo funkcijų, tokių kaip mokymasis ir įsiminimas. Stresas sutrikdo biocheminius pasiuntinius ir sveiką nervų signalo perdavimą. Bacopa mažina stresą ir atkuria ramybės jausmą didinant acetilcholino lygį, kuris sumažina jūsų širdies susitraukimų dažnį ir leidžia jums imtis gilesnius kvėpavimus.<br/><br/>Doxiderol yra puikus būdas gauti Bacopa naudą. Šis holistinis papildas taip pat yra kitų natūralių ingredientų, kurie skatina smegenų sveikatą ir remti savo gebėjimą sutelkti dėmesį ir sutelkti dėmesį į sudėtingą užduotį, taip pat įsiminti informaciją. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Ji taip pat gali jausti demoniškas auras ir blogio auras. Tačiau, kai ji gimė ir augo, jos galios buvo užsandarintos ir ji buvo daug mažiau galinga. Nuo to laiko, kai nugalėjo vieną, kuris užsandarino savo galias, Kagome pasiekė visą savo potencialą.<br/><br/>VALYMAS Užmegzdama fizinį ryšį, Kagome sugeba apvalyti tiek nuodus, tiek tamsą nuo subjekto (gyvo ir negyvo). Norėdami tai padaryti, ji projektuoja savo dvasines galias per savo ranką.<br/><br/>Turėdama visą potencialą, Kagome gali sukurti barjerą aplink save ir išplėsti jį aplink kitus. Tai kupolo formos barjeras, kuris gali sunaikinti silpnus demonus, kurie liečiasi su barjeru.<br/><br/>PAGERINTA AKIS<br/>Kagome turi gebėjimą matyti dalykus, kurie dažnai nematomi žmogaus akiai: vaiduokliai, dvasios, dieviškos ir blogos auros.<br/><br/>ĮGŪDŽIAI SU GINKLAIS<br/>Kagome turi galimybę naudoti lanką ir rodyklę. Ji buvo savarankiškai apmokyta, o po metų praktikos jos rodyklė retai praleidžia savo ženklą. Be to, Kagome turi galimybę įlieti savo strėles su galiomis. Ji gali įlieti strėlę su savo dvasinėmis galiomis, kurios leidžia jiems įsiskverbti į demoniškas jėgas, sunaikinti burtai ir išvalyti objektus. Ji gali įlieti savo lanką su savo galiomis ir nukreipti priešo atakas. Ji turi galimybę įlieti savo strėles su valymo energijos išvalyti nuodų, taip pat galingas, tolimas demoniškas atakas. Ir, pagaliau, ji turi galimybę apeiti kitus savo rodykle: jei jos taikinys yra už barjero ar įkaito, rodyklė gali teleportuotis ir smogti tik savo taikinį.<br/><br/>Likę jos sugebėjimai tapo gana nesvarbūs, nes jie yra susiję su kelionėmis laiku (per kaulų valgytojo šulinį), Shikono brangakmenį ar jos ankstesnį įsikūnijimą.<br/><br/>patranka<br/><br/>Tačiau Kagome buvo ištraukta praėjus kelioms dienoms po jos vidurinės mokyklos baigimo, kol kaulų valgytojo šulinys vėl atsidarė, kad ji galėtų visam laikui grįžti į praeitį.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>atsiminimai<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Jos vardo garsas buvo minkštas šnabždesys jos proto gale, tarsi vėjo nutildytas skambutis. Tai buvo tolimos atminties garsas, balsas, kurį ji pradėjo pamiršti, bet beviltiškai prilipo prie to paties. Tai buvo jos motinos balsas, susuktas į jos prarastos dukters liūdesį. Galų gale, Kagome ištremtas be pėdsakų. Ji ryškiai prisiminė tas akimirkas, kaip prasidėjo diena, ką ji turėjo pusryčiams ir paskutinį dalyką, kurį ji pasakė savo motinai. Tai buvo vaiduokliška, tie prisiminimai, nes tai buvo kaip bet kuris kitas laikas, kai ji paslydo tarp pasaulių. Ji buvo pabudusi, apatiška, nes ji neturėjo tikslo už mokyklos ribų. Ji galėjo rasti darbą ir buvo suplanuota interviu tą dieną. Jos širdis nebuvo jame, bet tai buvo tai, ką ji turėjo padaryti.<br/><br/>Ji prisiminė baimės jausmą, čiulpia ją ir suteikia sau pep kalbą, kad ji galėtų tai padaryti. Kad ji galėtų progresuoti gyvenime, kad ji buvo skirta dabar, kad viskas buvo išspręsta praeityje. Žinoma, ji jautėsi taip, tarsi nebepriklausytų nei savo laikui, nei savo gyvenimui, ne su viskuo, ką buvo palikusi.<br/><br/>Kagome prisiminė medienos po jos pirštais jausmą, kaip jos ranka buvo susisukusi į rankeną, kad atidarytų duris. Ji prisiminė, kad ji sustojo, pasuko į savo motiną su ryškia ir energinga šypsena, kai ji sukrėtė save nuo savo stuporo. "Aš pakilsiu." Ji prisiminė, kaip garsiai skambėjo jos balsas, šypsena ant motinos lūpų, kaip jos akys spindėjo pasididžiavimu. Jos motina atsisveikino su ja, kuri neatrodė kitokia nei anksčiau, bet kažkaip žodžių svoris buvo sunkesnis ant Kagome pečių, tuo labiau ji atsispindėjo.<br/><br/>Trumpai tariant, mintys mirgėjo į priekį, įdomu, ar jos motina jaudinosi dėl jos, praleido ją, kaip ir ji. Kagome galėjo atvirai pripažinti, kad jos motinos jėga, jos parama tai, kad jos dukra taip dažnai slydo per laiką. Buvo laikai, kai ji manė, kad ji yra silpna, nes moteris neturi liesos.<br/><br/>Tačiau ji prisiminė, kad ji sukaupė menką jėgų kiekį. Ji galėjo prisiminti oro poslinkį, temperatūrą, kuri labai skyrėsi nuo to, ko tikėjosi, mirksi staiga ir nepažįstamoje aplinkoje. Tai buvo ne jos šeimos šventovė. Ir kai ji pasuko grįžti, slydimo per duris ji atėjo per, ji susitiko su nepažįstamu ir šalto metalo po jos pirštų ir interjeras, kuris nebuvo įėjimas į savo namus. Priešais ją, už prekystalio, stovėjo vyras, kuris spoksojo į ją savo akimis.<br/><br/>Ji nepanikavo, bent jau. Būdamas suplėšyti per laiką ir įdėti į neįmanomas situacijas bent jau pastatė savo valios, kiek keistai įvykiai nuėjo. Nes tai buvo ne kiekvieną dieną, kad kažkas rado save tempia į praeitį demonas, ketindamas išplėšti galingą brangakmenį iš savo kūno, kad jie net nežinojo, kad ten buvo. Ir tada ten buvo tai, kad ji buvo sutriuškinti sakė galingas brangakmenis į kas žino, kiek vienetų ir buvo pavesta juos rasti. Tokie dalykai nebuvo normalu, ir ji turėjo kvadratinių ir sukti su juo, kai ji suprato, kad tai buvo jos realybė. Tai atrodė taip paprasta, tiesiog surinkti šukių ir nustatyti brangakmenį.<br/><br/>Bet nebuvo lengva, nes buvo daug demonų po šukių ir paties brangakmenio. Ir vienas ypač galingas demonas su troškimu, kad jis būtų matomas. Iki šios dienos, ji niekada išmoko savo norą, bet žinojo, ji niekada nebuvo suteikta net tada, kai jis sprogo dalykas baigtas. Jis sugriovė tiek daug gyvybių vardan nieko. Sunaikino tiek daug gyvybių už tokią bergždžią užduotį. Naraku buvo sunkiausia priešas, ir tas, kuris buvo visko, kad buvo negerai visų savo draugo gyvenime centras.<br/><br/>Bet tai buvo tas nenuspėjamumas, ta būtinybė susivynioti su tuo, kas vyksta, ir valios jėga, kurią ji įgijo iš savo nuotykių, kuriuos ji prisiminė piešdama, kad sugalvotų istoriją, kuri atitiktų tą akimirką, kuri neatrodė pernelyg įnoringa ar tolima. Ja reikėjo tikėti, jai reikėjo išgyventi.<br/><br/>Galų gale, ji susidūrė blogiau nei vyras fotoaparatų parduotuvėje. Ji melavo per savo dantis, kad išgelbėtų savo gyvenimą anksčiau.<br/><br/>"Aš ieškojau darbo." Galų gale, tai nebuvo visiškas melas. Galų gale, ji išėjo iš savo namų, siekdama dalyvauti darbo pokalbyje. Jos suknelės būklė bent jau liudija, kad daug. Tai buvo vienas iš lengviausių fibų, kuriuos ji kada nors pasakė.<br/><br/>Ir kažkodėl tas beprotis ją pasamdė.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed apsisuko savo lovoje, nes ji stumia tolimus prisiminimus, atsisakydama pripažinti, kad ji iš tikrųjų buvo pabudusi. Ji prispaudė paskutinius miego žvilgsnius, maldavo ją grįžti ir paimti ją atgal į savo apkabinimą. Ji užmerkė akis, norėjo užmigti ir susitiko tik su prisiminimais. Dainos aidas dainuodavo jos prisiminimų atstumu, daina, kuri dažnai ją kankindavo, suteikdama jai tą patį pavadinimą. Balsas, kuris dainavo, nebepriminė jos motinos, bet vaikų, kuriuos ji dažnai grojo augdama, balsus. Jie atšaukė prisiminimus, nors tai buvo metų, kai ji pradėjo šį gyvenimą, nors ji buvo laiminga šiame gyvenime, šių prisiminimų skambutis buvo per garsiai.<br/><br/>Staiga ji krito atgal į juos ir miego pabėgo ją vėl. Ji buvo žiūrėti save savo šeimos apkabinti, o Inuyasha buvo traukiamas atgal į šulinį, atrodo, kaip priblokšti, kaip ji jautėsi. Tos akimirkos prisiminimai, tie jausmai, vis dar buvo tokie stiprūs. Širdies plakimo ir liūdesio jausmas vėl pakilo, nors tai buvo taip seniai, nes ji jautė, kad ji buvo nuplėšta nuo visko, kas jai rūpėjo.<br/><br/>Žinoma, jos šeima buvo svarbi, ir ji džiaugėsi vėl būdama jų rankose. Ji niekada negalėjo visiškai, tikrai apibūdinti, kaip ji jautėsi tomis dienomis. Ji vis dar negalėjo paaiškinti, kaip ji jautėsi padalinta į dvi dalis, su kariaujančiais troškimais būti tiek savo praeityje, tiek dabartyje. Ji prisiminė bergždžius bandymus šokinėti per šulinį, pirštai knibždėte knibždėte knibžda į žemę beviltiška malda leisti jai grįžti. Pirmąjį mėnesį namuose ji nemiegojo tiek, kiek ji verkė.<br/><br/>Elysion buvo papuoštas panašią reakciją, nors tai buvo ne taip nuožmi, nes ji nežinojo, kur tiksliai ji paslydo per, nei ji nežinojo, kur ji galėtų kirminas savo kelią atgal. Jos tyrinėjimai buvo subtilus tarp darbo savo darbą ir bando įsikurti į šį gyvenimą. Ji neturėjo ketinimų likti, jokių ketinimų likti ilgiau nei jai reikia. Ir nors ji nebandė taip įnirtingai, kaip ji bandė, kai ji bandė grįžti į praeitį, jos aistra buvo dešimt kartų, nes ji neturėjo ryšių su šiuo pasauliu. Nes ji buvo tikrai vieniša... be jokios vilties, kad kas nors ją pasieks.<br/><br/>Savo neracionaliomis akimirkomis ji manė, kad Jewel ištraukė ją atgal ir rado naują pragarą, kuriame ji gyveno. Naujas pragaras, kuris priverstų ją padaryti norą, bet ji labai aiškiai prisiminė, kad ji norėjo, kad jis dingo amžinai. Tai nesustabdė jos sapnų, tų laikų, kai ji prabudo naktį, ir tie prisiminimai apie jos praeitį buvo sunkiausiai įveikiami, sunkiausiai užmirštami. Jos širdis pradėjo lenktyniauti panikos, kaip ji pasuko savo lovoje vėl, jos kvėpavimas tapo kova, kaip ji kovojo su panikos priepuolis sukeltas jos klajojo proto taip vėlai naktį.<br/><br/>Ji nekentė jausmas toks silpnas, taip bijo.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome pagaliau ištraukė save iš lovos, jos kambarys užsidegė šviesia šviesa, kurios pakako nukreipti ją į vonios kambarį. Ji stovėjo priešais veidrodį, kriauklė veikia, o ji spoksojo į savo atspindį. Varnas spalvos plaukai apėmė savo veidą ir ji jautėsi taip blogai, kaip ji atrodė. Jos pirmasis rytas Elysion buvo panašus į tai, tik ji buvo blogiau formos.<br/><br/>Ji rado vietą miegoti, sugebėjo parengti sandorį su pastato savininku, kad ji galėtų likti trumpą laiką nemokėdama. Galbūt tai buvo Miroku įtaka, kuri leido jai streikuoti tokiuose sandoriuose, nes vienuolis buvo žinomas dėl savo būdo žavingiems (arba apgaudinėjantiems) žmonėms suteikti jiems daugiau nei pakankamai už darbą, kurį jie padarė. Vienuolis visada buvo tokiu būdu, nes jie pirmą kartą susitiko. Jis teigė, kad valdovo būstas turi būti persekiojamas, kai jis nebuvo, arba teigia, kad jie buvo puolami, kai jie nebūtų. Jis pardavė savo palatas ir pakabukus už tokias dideles kainas. Jis dirbo beveik kiekvieną kartą ir ji įdomu, kodėl žmonės buvo taip nori pasitikėti juo.<br/><br/>Galbūt tai buvo jo šypsena, ar tai, kad jis buvo vienuolis, kad praeities žmonės buvo taip nori trupėti. Jis niekada grobis ant silpnųjų, bent jau. Jis visada darė tai, kas teisinga, ir jis buvo stiprybės simbolis jai kartais, kai jis būtų stumti per viską, kad daryti tai, kas teisinga. Jis stumia per tai, kad jis miršta, kad jis buvo prakeiktas, ir bandė kažką daryti apie tai, o ne wallowing savo likimą. Jis stumia save iki ribos, vedančios į savo galutinį kovą. Ir ji džiaugėsi, kad jie nugalėjo Naraku, kol jis negalėjo tapti tokio paties likimo kaip jo tėvas ir jo tėvas prieš jį.<br/><br/>Tačiau, kiek jos pačios pakabukai nuėjo, ji buvo teisingesnė nei jos draugas ir padarė sandorį pagrįstą. Ji abejojo, kad bet kas šiame pasaulyje mokės didelę kainą už egzorcizmą ar demonų išvarymą. Jie buvo pernelyg technologiškai pažengę. Bet ji buvo pakankamai protinga, ir pakankamai protingas, kad padaryti gerą sandorį.<br/><br/>Bet dabar Kagome buvo geresnėje vietoje, nors jos veido išvaizda atrodė tokia pati. Haunted, pavargęs, nusausintas ...<br/><br/>Greitas žvilgsnis į laikrodį ant sienos jai pasakė, kad ji gali bandyti miegoti ilgiau. Bet ji atsisakė, kad, nenori susidurti su flashbacks dar kartą. Vietoj to ji paėmė dušą, naudodamas šaltą vandenį, kad išvytų savo demonus, užpildytų plaučius aštriu kvėpavimu ir priverstų save pabusti.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Tai nesuveikė.<br/><br/>Ne taip, kaip ji norėjo. Šaltas vanduo tikrai privertė orą į savo plaučius, privertė savo protą pabusti ir raumenis užimti. Kartus juokas buvo ištrauktas iš jos lūpų, kaip ji pakreipė galvą atgal ir rado save prisiminti daugiau. Šiandien ji nesiruošė jų taip lengvai pabėgti. Ji nesiruošė atsigauti taip paprastai, kad atsigautų tik todėl, kad ji to norėjo.<br/><br/>Kartais, nėra išvengti minčių norėjote. Net tada, kai buvote tikri, kad jums buvo praeityje juos.<br/><br/>Sango būtų labai padėjęs šioje situacijoje. Demonas žudikas buvo jos geriausias draugas, ji netgi eidavo taip toli, kad vadintų ją seserimi, kurios ji niekada neturėjo. Vyresnė sesuo, kuri buvo išmintinga, visada turėjo savo pusę, kai iškilo problemų. Ypač berniukas problemų, kai tokie dalykai buvo gana trivialus, bet tai buvo smagu turėti traiškyti ir jos draugas būti proto dėl jos vardu, kai Inuyasha padarė ją liūdna. Galų gale, tai buvo dažnai, kad pusė demonas bėgo į savo mirusiojo meilužio pusėje ir sulaužyti savo širdį daugiau nei vieną kartą.<br/><br/>Bet Sango taip pat įkvėpė ją kitais būdais. Po to, kai moteris susidūrė, ji visada buvo tokia stipri, tokia tikra... Net tais laikais, kai ji abejojo savimi, ji visada traukė per. Ji žavėjosi, kad ji turėjo galimybę išgyventi po to, kai prarado visą savo šeimą - priminimas apie tai dažnai privertė Kagome išgyventi, nes ji prarado visus šiame pasaulyje - ir tada jos brolis tapo Naraku pėstininku. Tai nebuvo lengva, negalėjo būti kažkas, kad tik kas nors galėtų susidurti ir vis dar eiti į priekį. Ji vis dar šypsojosi, net su tuo skausmu ir tais priminimais... Ji dažnai buvo tokia šviesi, net tamsesniais laikais.<br/><br/>Ir dabar ji norėjo pasilenkti į vyresnės moters pusę, paguosti tuo, kad ji ten buvo ir ji buvo palaikanti. Ji manė, kad Sango kažkaip tai ištrauks ir pasiūlys stiprybės ir supratimo žodžius. Tai buvo laikai, kaip šie, kad padarė šiuos burtai blogiau, nuolatinis priminimas, kad ji buvo be savo šeimos.<br/><br/>"Aš nenoriu būti vienas." Ji šaukė garsiai savo vienatvės, iš dušo skendimo iš prašymo garsas.<br/><br/>Ji nebijojo tai pripažinti.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Dar viena valanda paslydo, kol ji suprato. Jos oda buvo šalta iš vandens ir ji jautėsi kaip ledas bėgo per jos venas. Ji nesuprato, ji pradėjo drebėti, kol jos ranka pasiekė išjungti vandenį ir baigti savo dušas. Kagome vėl neieškojo savo žvilgsnio į veidrodį, o suvyniojo save į rankšluosčius ir ištempė iš vonios kambario, laiptais ir į savo virtuvę. Ji pradėjo gaminti lengvus pusryčius, tingiai skaitydama savo užrašus tą dieną, kai maistas virtas.<br/><br/>Pastaraisiais metais jos karjera iš tikrųjų prasidėjo. Jos nuotraukos buvo rodomos daugelyje galerijų, jos vardas pradėjo dažnai lūpomis tiems, kurie domisi fotografija.<br/><br/>Darbas, kurį ji paprašė dėl užgaidos, visa tai sukėlė. Ji buvo daug laimingesnė, nei tikėjosi, kad ji bus šiame pasaulyje. Niekada pasisekė, kad slydo atgal per įtrūkimus į savo pasaulį, bet pasisekė pakankamai gerai. Kai ji grįžo į viryklę, ji prisiminė laiką, kurį ji pagaliau atsisakė grįžti namo. Tai buvo apie dvejus metus į savo gyvenimą čia, nes ji pradėjo žengti į fotografiją kaip daugiau nei tik hobis, bet kažkas, su kuria ji galėjo padaryti sau vardą.<br/><br/>Tą dieną buvo ypač malonus, saulė buvo aukštai danguje, ir ji rado sau fotografuoti gamtos peizažai. Mažas berniukas buvo pasislėpęs viename iš augalų, ir ji buvo sugauti momento nuotrauka jo veidas apsigyveno linksmas, išdykęs šypsotis akimirką, kol jis šoktelėjo iš šokinėti į savo grobį. Tai jai priminė Shippou, mažą kitsuną, kurį ji iš esmės įvaikino. Jis taip pat buvo išplėštas iš savo šeimos, kai jie pirmą kartą susitiko. Jo tėvas nužudė ir jis buvo pasiryžęs atkeršyti jam. Būdamas jaunas, jis atrodė toks subrendęs per savo pirmuosius susitikimus.<br/><br/>Galbūt tai buvo Inuyasha įtaka, kuri leido rinkiniui vėl veikti kaip vaikas, kartais jaunas ir įnoringas, o kitiems jis buvo brandesnis. Jis pasiūlė jai paguodą savo būdu, ir ji bandė rūpintis juo kaip ji pati, nors ji buvo tokia jauna, kaip ir tada. Tačiau jos jaunystė nesustabdė jos nuo supratimo, kaip elgtis su juo ar rūpintis juo kaip savo vaiku. Jos širdis išsipūtė, kai jis nusišypsojo, kai jis buvo toks laimingas dėl savo pieštukų dovanos ir paėmė laiko padaryti meną. Ji taip didžiavosi kiekvienu piešiniu, kurį jis baigė, kad žinojo, kad taip motina jaustųsi tokioje situacijoje.<br/><br/>Skausmas, kuris buvo perplėštas per ją, buvo per daug, per staiga. Ji praleido jį ir norėjo pamatyti, kiek jis išaugo, nes ji buvo dingo. Ji praleido tiek daug...<br/><br/>Kad apsisaugotų nuo bet kokio tolesnio skausmo, bet kokių klaidingų vilčių... Ji pasidavė ir sutelkė dėmesį į savęs tobulinimą.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Pusryčiai buvo minkšti, nuobodūs ir įkvėpti. Tik po to, kai ji baigė, ji suprato, kad ji pamiršo bet kokius prieskonius ar skonį maistui. Dabar buvo per vėlu prisiminti, kad daug, nes jos protas buvo per daug užsiėmęs, kad prisimintų kitas jos gyvenimo detales, kurios akivaizdžiai tapo svarbesnės už jos maistą.<br/><br/>"Sėskis!"<br/><br/>Žinoma, nieko neįvyko, kai ji piktai šaukė ant vieno ypač varginančio kliento, kuris priminė jai apie pusę demono. Jis buvo ypač užsispyręs ir grubus, norėdamas, kad nuotrauka būtų padaryta, o ne natūraliai. Galite pabandyti priversti laukinius gyvūnus elgtis taip, kaip norėjote. Bet retai kas nors pavyko jėga. Inuyasha buvo ne taip blogai, tačiau. Inuyasha išmoko, kol ji buvo priversta nuo jo. Jis tapo švelnesnis, supratingesnis, brandesnis, nors kartais jis vis dar buvo vaikiškas ir linksmas.<br/><br/>Ji prisimena, kaip raudoni jos skruostai degė, bet kaip ji stovėjo ant žemės ir atleido jį. Ji jam pasakė, kad ji atsisakė dirbti visiems ar visiems, kurie norėjo pasukti kažką už jos prigimties, už savo troškimų.<br/><br/>Ji turėjo palyginti žmogų su Naraku, o ne Inuyasha. Nors jos klientas neturėjo tokių ekstremalių ketinimų. Bent jau jausmas po to buvo malonus prisiminimas. Laisvė žinoti, kad ji taip toli nuėjo, kad galėjo atsisakyti darbo, kurio ji nenorėjo daryti, būti savo nuo kitų nepriklausomu asmeniu. Ji galėjo pasakyti, kad ji tai padarė tuo metu. Nors po kelių dienų ji išgirdo gandus, kuriais ketino ją šmeižti.<br/><br/>Ji gynė save teisingai, kaip ir savo kelionės pabaigoje, nes ji buvo vienintelė, galinti apsiginti šiame pasaulyje.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Ryto šviesa pradėjo šliaužti į savo namus, vėl primindama jai apie laiko praėjimą. Vėlgi, ji apsvarstė dalykų, kuriuos ji turėjo padaryti, sąrašą ir aptarė, kur pradėti. Arba, jei ji net turėtų pradėti. Su tuo, kaip prasidėjo diena, ji nežinojo, ar ji galėtų laikyti, kad puiki idėja. Buvo abejotina, ar ji bus sėkminga, kaip ji prarado save.<br/><br/>Ji nenorėjo supainioti savo naujausio darbo, nes ji tai padarė keletą kartų anksčiau. Nebuvo malonu pabandyti ir atsigauti po visiškos nelaimės.<br/><br/>Kagome prisiminė savo brangaus, visiškai naujo, fotoaparato slydimo iš rankų jausmą. Ji nebuvo pasirengusi jį palaikyti, nes ji ką tik pašalino jį iš savo maišo. Dalis jos šaukė viduje. Dramatiškas, over-the-top, pilnas rėkti, kad ji dažnai darė, kai ji buvo daug, daug jaunesnis. Kai ji buvo sunku padaryti per vidurinę mokyklą, o šokinėja tarp kartų. Kita jos dalis liko užšaldyta, o jos objektyvas buvo visiškai sudaužytas, o likusi fotoaparato dalis buvo sulaužyta.<br/><br/>Matydamas Inuyasha brolį, pilnas demonas, stovėti priešais ją buvo paskutinis dalykas, ji tikėjosi, kai ji padarė savo kelią iš savo nuotraukas. Jis stovėjo kaip niekada didžiuotis, kaip aukštas, kaip niekada, kaip įspūdingas, kaip ji prisiminė. Jis neatrodė fasadas visiškai kitokiame pasaulyje, nors ji niekada nebuvo geriausia skaityti savo mintis. Jo vardas ant lūpų buvo toks stiprus, kad ji galėjo prisiminti mažiausius jausmus, kaip ir ji. Jos lūpos buvo suspaustos, jos burna jautėsi sausa, o burbuliuojantis nerimo jausmas jos skrandyje privertė ją jaustis blogai.<br/><br/>Ji nenorėjo, kad jos viltys būtų išpildytos.<br/><br/>Bet ji norėjo, kad jis būtų ten, net jei jie nebuvo draugai. Jie buvo sąjungininkai, jei nieko, nes jie kovojo šalia. Ir kažkas buvo geriau nei visiškai nieko.<br/><br/>Ir Kagome turėjo pakankamai prasmės ne mesti save į jį, wrap savo rankas aplink jį reljefo, kad žinodamas, ji buvo ne vieni. Jos fotoaparatas nebėra svarbu, kai ji kreipėsi į jį. Ji prisiminė, kad niekas kitas nesvarbu dienų, kaip ji praleido laiką su juo, o ne kalbėti apie savo pasaulį, bet kalbėti (arba, ji kalbėjo ir jis tiesiog pripažino, kad tai).<br/><br/>Kai, tiksliai, ji nukrito jam nors... Kagome negalėjo prisiminti. Tai buvo subtilus dalykas, kaip ir jis buvo. Bet ji žinojo, jausmas ten buvo. Ir jis leido jai žinoti, kad ji buvo ne viena, kad ji nukrito, kad jausmai kažkaip suklestėjo.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Nesvarumo jausmas aplenkė ją ir staiga jos akys atsivėrė, o jos protas desperatiškai prispaudė paskutinį dalyką, kurį ji darė. Ji neprisiminė, kai ji užmigo ant sofos, bet ji žinojo, kad paskutinė vieta, kurioje ji buvo, buvo ant pernelyg patogių pagalvių. Tačiau ji nekovojo ar kovojo su nesvarumu, nes ji buvo pažįstama rankose. Jos galva pakreipta į Sesshoumaru krūtinės, atsižvelgiant komfortą, kad jis buvo čia ir ji buvo ne viena.<br/><br/>"Sveiki sugrįžę." Jo atsakymas buvo švelnus hum pripažinimas. Jam nereikėjo daug kalbėti, kad ji suprastų savo ketinimą, ar tai, ką jis turėjo pasakyti.<br/><br/>Jis paėmė ją atgal į savo lovą, įsitaisė ją lengvai. Jos akys susitiko su jo ir ji šypsojosi lengvai, nes daugiau prisiminimai dreifuoja atgal, ne daugiau prisiminimai erzina ją. Ne, kai jis buvo arti, ji niekada nukrito atgal į tas mintis. Jis padėjo, ir metai padėjo. Šiandien buvo tik... viena iš tų dienų.<br/><br/>"Miego." Jis įsakė lengvai, jos akys valcavimo į jį, bet ji ne kovojo, nes ji buvo pavargusi. Jos ranka tvirtai prilipo prie jo, o ji pajuto savo priešingą ranką paspauskite prie kaktos vertinant savo gerovę.<br/><br/>"Aš esu gerai", - sakė ji, jos žodžiai tvirti su savo pažadu.<br/><br/>Jai viskas buvo gerai, ji buvo gyva, ir ji buvo laiminga.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>siuntėjas<br/><br/>santrauka<br/><br/>Kagome, vienu metu savo gyvenime, buvo gana įprasta paauglė mergaitė, kol ją užpuolė demonas savo šeimos šulinio namuose. Demonas nutempė ją į šulinį, kuris stebuklingai nunešė ją apie 500 metų į praeitį. Ten ji sužinojo, kad jos kūne buvo šventas brangakmenis, nes ji buvo kunigės, mirusios 50 metų prieš tai, kai ji buvo įtraukta, reinkarnacija. Brangakmenis buvo išplėštas iš jos kūno, o demonas, kuris ją tempė per laiką, buvo nugalėtas pusės demono, kurį ji išlaisvino, kuris buvo prisegtas prie medžio. Kagome susidraugavo su puse demono, Inuyasha, laiku ir keliavo su juo atkurti brangakmenį, kad ji pati, sudaužė. Nors tai buvo ne taip paprasta ir lengva padaryti, kaip daugelis demonų ir žmonių siekė savo tikslams brangakmenį. Ji susidraugavo su jaunu kitsune demonu, vienuoliu ir demonų žudiku, kurie visi keliavo su ja, kad atkurtų brangakmenį.<br/><br/>Tačiau jos grupė buvo ne ta, kuri užbaigė brangakmenį, o blogas pusiau demonas, kuris manipuliavo dauguma svarbiausių įvykių jos kompaniono gyvenime. Kai jis pagaliau surinko visus brangakmenio gabalus ir padarė savo norą dėl sutepto objekto, Kagome buvo įtrauktas į patį brangakmenį, siekdamas savanaudiško noro išlaikyti ją įstrigusią viduje amžinai, išlaikant brangakmenį gyvą. Tai buvo Inuyasha užsispyrimas, kuris sugebėjo išgelbėti ją nuo tamsos. Galų gale, ji grįžo į savo natūralų laiką, baigė vidurinę mokyklą, kaip ir tikėtasi iš savo laiko juostos mergaitės. Nors po kelių dienų Kagome baigėsi Elysion. Ji jau penkerius metus gyvena šiame pasaulyje, ir jau seniai atsisakė grįžti namo. Ji laimingai apsigyveno savo naujame gyvenime.<br/><br/>Platono<br/><br/>Kagome gana lengva susirasti naujų draugų, ji daug nepasikeitė nuo jaunystės. Ji yra linksma jauna moteris, kuri yra empatiška ir svetinga labiausiai savo gyvenime. Jaunystėje ji susidraugavo su demonais, kai dauguma jų bijojo. Net demonai, kurie anksčiau valgė žmones, ji susidraugavo ir pakeitė savo kelius (ji norėtų galvoti). Tai pasakius, tikrai lengva tapti jos draugu, kol kas nors gali parodyti, kad jie nori būti išpirkti, arba parodyti, kad jie nėra visiškai blogi. Ji jaučiasi labai visiems, su kuriais ji susitinka, todėl sunku, kad ji nebūtų pritraukta prie kitų, norėdama būti draugais.<br/><br/>antagonistinis<br/><br/>Vienintelis būdas užsitarnauti Kagomės rūstybę yra būti tokia apgailėtina, tokia bloga, ir taip toli už išpirkimo, kad ji negali matyti nieko gero tavyje. Ir ji gali matyti gėrį beveik visiems ir viskam. Sąžiningai, su kuo ji susidūrė? Pusė demono, kuris sumušė du įsimylėjėlius vienas prieš kitą, kuris prakeikė visą vieno iš savo draugų vyrišką liniją, o tada jos geriausios draugės brolis nužudė jų šeimą... Taip, aš nematau jos nekenčiančios nieko be jų tikrai, tikrai dirbančios dėl to. Jauskitės laisvai suteikti jai kulka, nors.<br/><br/>Romantiškas<br/><br/>Kai meilė, Kagome yra stipri parama, visada būna ten, net kai viskas gali būti grubus. Tačiau Kagome neieško meilės, neieškojo meilės, kai ji atvyko, todėl nėra jokių praeities santykių. Tai nereiškia, kad kažkas jos neįsimylėjo. Ji tikrai gali būti kažkieno neatlygintinos meilės tema, ji tikriausiai pamiršta apie tai. Galiausiai Kagome šiuo metu užsiima Sesshoumaru, stebėtinai. Vis dėlto esu visiškai atviras potencialiems AU dalykams. <3<br/><br/>fandom pragaras<br/><br/>Amžius senas<br/><br/>rūšis kosminė karalienė<br/><br/>Miršta okupantas<br/><br/>Mėgsta ji/ji<br/><br/>Apdovanojimai<br/><br/>pro ji / ji yra 62woo i čiulpia ne sklypo atsakymus. bet ok anyways!!!

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Kodėl turėtumėte būti „Twitter“<br/><br/>Atsakomybės apribojimas: Aš nesu ir niekada nesakiau, kad esu socialinės žiniasklaidos guru. Aš esu tik žmogus, kuris daug galvoja apie dalykus, ir tai atsirado keletą kartų.<br/><br/>Aš nesu ankstyvas įvaikintojas. Kartais man reikia metų, kad suprasčiau, ką aš noriu naudoti, kol aš iš tikrųjų jį gauti, ir "Twitter" buvo vienas iš tų dalykų. Aš buvau "Twitter" rimtai nuo maždaug šių metų vasario, todėl aš esu gana naujas. Vis dėlto, aš sužinojau keletą dalykų, ir aš norėjau pasidalinti jais. Kai kurie žmonės sako, kad aš esu Twitter stūmikas, ir aš esu, nes yra daug gerų priežasčių gauti jį, ir beveik jokių trūkumų.<br/><br/>Taigi, kas yra "Twitter"? Jei esate internete, tikriausiai bent jau girdėjote apie tai. Tai socialinės žiniasklaidos tinklas, kuris tarnauja kaip pokalbių, atnaujinimų ir naujienų forumas žiniasklaidos daugiau visuomenės nei kažkas panašaus į "Facebook" ar "LinkedIn". "Facebook" yra apie tai, kas nori jus rasti, bet "Twitter" yra apie tai, kas norite rasti. Jūsų mėgstamiausi rašytojai, aktoriai, politikai, dainininkai ir mokslininkai tikriausiai "Twitter". Taip pat yra jūsų mėgstamiausios labdaros organizacijos, radijo stotys, naujienų svetainės ir parduotuvės. Ir jie nori, kad juos surastumėte ir klausytumėtės, ką jie turi pasakyti. Visi "Twitter" bent jau iš pradžių nori su jumis pasikalbėti.<br/><br/>Bet kodėl prisijungti prie jo? Kodėl būti jo dalimi? Yra įvairių priežasčių, ir aš duosiu jums keletą.<br/><br/>Žmonės ir vietos „Twitter“ yra puikus būdas sužinoti apie įvykius, vykstančius visame pasaulyje, bet ir jūsų bendruomenėje. Jei keliaujate ir ieškote dalykų, kuriuos reikia padaryti, tai puikus būdas sužinoti apie dalykus, susijusius su jūsų interesais (nes žmonės, kuriuos sekate, yra žmonės, kuriuos domina). Net jei jūs ne keliaujate, žinant apie puikias vietas eiti vietoje arba žinant, kad žmonės jus domina vyksta į juos sukuria galimybę susitikti su jais ir sukurti gilesnius santykius su jais. Jei grįšite į mano vakarėlio įrašą, visi jame esantys žmonės, išskyrus du, aš apie tai girdėjau "Twitter" ir tada susitiko realiame gyvenime, ir dabar mes esame gana geri draugai. Ir kuo daugiau tai padarysite, tuo daugiau dalykų sužinosite, ir kuo daugiau žmonių sutiksite. Ir jei sekate juos "Twitter", jūs jau žinote šiek tiek apie tai, kas jie yra. Jie nori, kad jūs. Atvirkštinis taip pat yra tiesa, nes "Twitter" kviečia žmones pamatyti, kas jūs esate, ir jie gali padaryti tuos pačius pasirinkimus apie jus.<br/><br/>Įkvėpimas ir motyvacija<br/>Įkvėpimas ateina iš keisčiausių vietų, o tweets antplūdis reiškia, kad visada yra šviežio turinio jūsų vaizduotei. Aš turiu sekti pirmąją politiką, todėl aš seksiu tik apie ką nors, o tada periodiškai eiti per ir nesekioti žmonių. Nežinau, kas pasodins manyje naujo tinklaraščio įrašo ar naujo projekto sėklą, todėl man patinka išlaikyti savo pasirinkimus atvirus. Motyvacija taip pat vyksta, nes Twitter yra kaip gyvenimas. Jei apsupsite save žmonėmis, kurie yra ambicingi, atsidavę, dosnūs ir sunkiai dirbantys, lengviau būti tokiais ir stumti save. Tai lengviau galvoti, kad jei jie gali planuoti renginius, pradėti projektus, arba tiesiog keltis ryte, gerai, taip pat galite.<br/><br/>Mokymosi ir gyvenimo būdo Bloggers yra Twitter. Bloggers, kurie nėra iš tikrųjų gali būti crazy. Ir žmonės dienoraštį apie beveik viską. Jei jūs ieškote išmokti kažką, šansai yra gerai, kad kažkas tweeting apie tai. Be to, naujienų tarnybos ir parduotuvės taip pat yra prijungtos, o tai reiškia, kad galite gauti savo naujienas iki minutės ir sužinoti apie pardavimus ir sandorius, kai jie prasideda. Sekite keletą maitinimo įstaigų ir pamatyti, ką jie sugalvoti. Reikia Tvist už tą kokteilių šalis? "Twitter" turi žmonių, kad taip pat. Spinta rekomendacijas, ar tiesiog norite pamatyti, ką kiti žmonės daro su savo gyvenimu? Tai viskas ten.<br/><br/>Yra keletas bendrų iššūkių, su kuriais susiduriu kalbėdamas apie tai, ir jie yra teisėtos kliūtys. Tai gali atrodyti gana bauginanti, ypač jei vėluojate į "bandwagon", kaip ir aš. Aš praleido mėnesius po tik du žmones ir nežino, ką dar daryti. Bet yra būdų, kaip juos įveikti, ir išgirsti jie nuo rečiausiai dauguma.<br/><br/># 3: "Twitter" yra narciziškas jerks<br/>Manau, kad tai kyla iš idėjos, kad dauguma žmonių tweets už ir apie save kaip būdas gauti dėmesį. Ką aš nesuprantu, kodėl yra kažkas negerai su tuo, arba kodėl tai daro, kad vienas daro narcizistas ar trūkčioti. Jei kas nors turi ką pasakyti, jie nori būti išgirsti. Įpratę būti gatvės kampe ir šaukti. Dabar galite šaukti 140 ar mažiau simbolių. "Twitter" yra tik naujas būdas būti išklausytam. Dabar "Twitter" tikrai yra narciziškų jerkų. Jie yra beveik visur. Kartais žmonės yra trūkčiojantys. Kartais vienas iš tų žmonių esu aš, atsiprašau pasakyti. Nesekite tų žmonių. Jei jums nepatinka tai, ką kas nors sako, ar tai yra taškai, kuriuos jie daro, ar išsamios ataskaitos apie jų vonios veiklą, jums nereikia klausytis "Twitter".<br/><br/># 2: Aš negaliu sekti visko.<br/>Antroji kliūtis, kurią žmonės dažnai kelia, yra ta, kad jie tiesiog neturi laiko sekti visų dalykų, kurie vyksta "Twitter". Ir jūs žinote, ką? Tai gerai. Sekite, ką galite. Gal jūs tik klajojate kas kelias dienas. Jei esate privatus vartotojas (o ne jūsų įmonės tweetingas), o ypač pradedantysis, tai gerai. Dalis kažko yra geriau nei nieko.<br/><br/># 1 Aš neturiu nieko, ką norėčiau įdėti ten.<br/>Tai bene dažniausias iššūkis, kurį žmonės kelia. Ir tai net nesvarbu. Jums nereikia prisijungti prie „Twitter“, kad galėtumėte kalbėtis. Prisijunkite prie jo, kad klausytumėtės. Vėlgi, čia yra jūsų mėgstami autoriai, dainininkai, tinklaraštininkai ir laikraščiai. Tai jūsų šansas klausytis jų. Tai jūsų šansas įgyti langą į savo gyvenimą ir veiklą, ir jie kviečia jus tai padaryti. Norite sužinoti, ką Felicia diena ketina būti iki San Diego Comic Con? Atlikta. Pažįstu žmonių, kurie tik klauso Twitter, ir tai puiku. Štai ką aš dariau kurį laiką. Galų gale, galbūt rasite kažką, apie ką čivinti, arba kažką, apie ką čivinti. Tikiuosi, kad tai padarysite, nes noriu apie tai išgirsti.<br/><br/>Trumpai tariant, jei nenaudojate "Twitter", manau, kad turėtumėte būti. Jei nenaudojate viso to, pabandykite. Nebijokite sekti penkių šimtų žmonių, jei visi tie žmonės sako dalykus, kurie jus domina. Pakvieskite tuos žmones į savo gyvenimo dalis ir pažiūrėkite, kaip jis pagerėjo dėl sąveikos. Aš laukiu išgirsti iš jūsų. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Šaknų kanalai<br/><br/>Pati mintis gauti šaknies kanalą kelia dauguma žmonių krašto.

Danties nervas yra minkštajame audinyje (plaušyje) šaknies kanalo viduje. Jei dantis yra pažeistas dėl traumos ar ėduonies, šiukšlės gali patekti į jautrią šaknies kanalo sritį ir sukelti infekciją arba ekstremaliomis aplinkybėmis ir abscesą. Abscesas dantis yra labai rimtas ir turėtų būti elgiamasi kaip skubios pagalbos, nes ji gali sukurti infekciją, kuri gali plisti į kitas kūno dalis. Jei manote, kad turite abscesas dantis, nedelsdami kreipkitės į mūsų biurą planuoti skubios pagalbos.<br/><br/>Priklausomai nuo atvejo, šaknies kanalo terapija gali reikalauti daugiau nei vieno vizito. Bus atliktas pradinis rentgeno tyrimas, siekiant įvertinti danties ir šaknies kanalą ir nustatyti žalos ir infekcijos mastą, jei yra. Jums bus suteikta anestezijos forma, kad atsipalaiduotumėte.<br/><br/>Kai sritis yra nutirpęs, mūsų odontologas sukurs prieigos kamerą prie šaknies kanalo, naudojant elektrinį rankeną. Tada šaknies kanalas bus išbrauktas iš užkrėstų ar pažeistų audinių ir nervų.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Bažnytinis apačia Mediena<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Jungtinės Amerikos Valstijos<br/><br/>Dabar vadinamas Karalienės medžiu<br/><br/>Tarp 1860 ir 1880 m. centras buvo išplėštas iš Londono miesto, kad būtų pastatytos kanalizacijos, geležinkeliai ir nauji keliai. Namai buvo nugriauti neatsižvelgiant į nuomininkus, kurie turėjo rasti bet kokį apgyvendinimą, kurį jie galėjo kitur. Vadybininkai nuvyko į livo Kensingtone ir St. John's Wood, o neturtingiausi žmonės pateko į rookeries, pavyzdžiui, "Seven Dials" ir "Lisson Grove". Tiems, kurie yra tarp tarnautojų ir kvalifikuotų darbininkų, spekuliatyvūs statybininkai sudėjo eilę po eilės terasinių vilų ir p. Pooter persikėlė į Holloway. "Muswell Hill" žmonės stebėjo namus per Finsbury parko laukus, iki Crouch Hill ir žemyn iš kitos pusės, kad iki 1880 m. "Crouch End" buvo sukurtas ir atrodė, kad nėra jokio būdo sustabdyti srautą. Po dešimties metų buvo parduoti dideli Muswell Hill dvarai. Upton ūkis buvo parduotas, o bažnytiniai komisarai norėjo sukurti Churchyard Bottom Wood, dabar vadinamą "Queen's Wood". Istorija būtų sukūrusi Ibseno pjesę. Dvi grupės sąžiningų, labai motyvuotų žmonių, kovojančių už tai, kas, jų manymu, buvo teisinga. Iš vienos pusės, bažnytiniai komisarai ir, iš kitos pusės, Hornsey labdaros komitetas tikėjo, kad jie daro viską, kad padėtų kitiems žmonėms, ir visuomenė supyko prieš juos abu.<br/><br/>Tuo metu „Muswell Hill Road“ buvo kaimo kelias, kurio viename gale buvo „Southwood Hall“, o kitame - „Upton Farm“. Iki 1894 m. Buvo pastatytas „Onslow Gardens“, „Connaught Gardens“, o statybininkai buvo pasirengę plėtoti „Woodlands“ dvarą. Iškirpti iš Churchyard Bottom Wood buvo grupė namelių, esančių trikampėje vietoje. Neapibrėžtame žemėlapyje, kurį turi bažnytiniai komisarai, rodomi šeši Wasteland kotedžai su anga tarp jų - ne kelias, ne metalizuotas, bet kelias į braškių lovas. Toliau buvo dar viena spraga, dėl kurios pėsčiųjų takai per medieną. Šios dvi angos turėjo būti plano pagrindas. Tos pačios dvi spragos ir išvalyta žemė, kuri buvo braškių laukas, galima pamatyti 1894 m. Žemėlapyje žemiau. Jie rodomi kaip "Muswell Hill Cottages" ir, gana praeinant, Peter Sellers turėjo gyventi toje pačioje vietoje daug vėliau. Kad išplėtotų mišką kaip būstą, komisarai turėjo važiuoti dviem keliais per Muswell Hill Road ir statyti namus palei juos. Vien tik "Muswell Hill Road" fasadas nebūtų suteikęs pakankamai vietos namams, kad įmonė būtų verta.<br/><br/>Žemė ir kotedžai buvo suteikta daug anksčiau, kaip išmaldos namai, kuriuose gyveno seni žmonės, ir jų vardu buvo laikomi Hornsey labdaros komisarų patikėtiniai. Iki 1890-ųjų kotedžai buvo nuleisti, reikalingi dideli remonto darbai. Visuomenės dvasia, norintys padaryti viską, kad jų senų nuomininkų, patikėtiniai negalėjo pagerinti juos, nes jie neturėjo pinigų. Prieš keletą metų bažnytiniai komisarai planavo sukurti žvyro duobę (dabar Highgate Wood) kaip būstą, tačiau tai susidūrė su tokia opozicija, kad jie atsisakė. Vietoj to, 1886 m. Jie davė visuomenei visą 69 akrų mišką. Tuo pačiu metu jie pasiūlė parduoti "Churchyard Bottom Wood" Hornsey miesto rajono tarybai už 25 000 svarų sterlingų, tačiau tai buvo per daug, kad Hornsey galėtų pakelti savarankiškai. Taryba sakė, kad žmonės, gyvenantys už Hornsey taip pat patiko medienos ir kitos valdžios institucijos turėtų padėti, bet jokios pagalbos nebuvo suteikta. Galų gale pasiūlymas nustojo galioti.<br/><br/>Žemėlapis, kuriame pavaizduoti Muswell Hill kotedžai, kurie buvo ginčų centras.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road apie 1880 m.<br/><br/>Atrodo tikėtina, kad šios trys kotedžų poros buvo ginčo centre.<br/><br/>Bažnytiniai komisarai norėjo surinkti pinigų savo bažnytiniam darbui Didžiojoje Britanijoje ir užsienyje. Jie manė, kad jiems buvo duota žemė, skirta religijos propagavimui, ir jei tai reiškė parduoti žemę ar miškus, tai buvo mažiau blogis nei apriboti bažnyčios darbą. Jie davė visuomenei žvyro iškastą medieną: vietoj to jie sukūrė Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Iš Hornsey labdaros patikėtiniai norėjo gaminti pajamas, siekiant padėti savo neturtingiems žmonėms, todėl jie pateikė pasiūlymą Komisijos nariams. Jų trikampis žemės sklypas buvo pernelyg nepatogios formos, kad būtų ekonomiškai išvystytas, bet jei komisarai suteiktų jiems šiek tiek daugiau žemės, kad ji taptų kvadratine vieta, jie pastatytų dvidešimt penkias tvarkingas vilas. Tai atneštų žemės nuomos 225 svarų sterlingų per metus, kuris galėtų būti naudojamas siekiant sumažinti Hornsey žmonių skurdą. Mainais jie leistų Komisijai ers sumažinti du kelius per savo žemę, kad komisarai galėtų plėtoti miškus.<br/><br/>Kai šis pasiūlymas tapo žinoma, žmonės iš karto reagavo su signalizacija.<br/><br/>1893 m. gruodžio 16 d. parlamentaras Carvellas Williamsas Bendruomenių rūmuose paklausė, ar bažnytiniai komisarai sutiko parduoti žemės sklypą Hornsey labdaros patikėtiniams su sąlyga, kad esamas kelias bus išplėstas iki 40 pėdų, ar tai buvo preliminari statybos schema ir ar Parlamento rūmai turės galimybę pareikšti nuomonę.<br/><br/>Ponas Levesonas Goweris, bažnytinės nuosavybės komisaras, atsakė: "Taip" pirmajai daliai.<br/><br/>Carvellas Williamsas: „Ar aš suprantu, kad ketinama sunaikinti tą Highgate Woods dalį, remiantis ja?“<br/><br/>Po dviejų dienų „Žvaigždė“ paskelbė straipsnį, vertą bet kurio šiuolaikinio bulvarinio laikraščio.<br/><br/>Žvaigždė<br/>1893 m. gruodžio 18 d.<br/><br/>„Parlamentas turi atidžiai stebėti tuos senus vandalus ir jerry statybininko konfederatus, bažnytinius komisarus, kurie visada atima dalį žemės arba teikia pirmenybę statytojams, o ne plačiajai visuomenei. Komisarai nepardavBažnyčios dugno medienos mokesčių mokėtojams, bet dabar siūlo "atverti ją", nukertant per ją du plačius kelius, susijusius su viena iš jų daugybės statybos schemų. Ar kas nors nepateiks klausimo Parlamentui ir nepatikrins Komisijos narių mūro ir skiedinio politikos?"<br/><br/>Iki to laiko, kai tai buvo išspausdinta, klausimas buvo užduotas ir atsakymas buvo arba neteisingas, arba apgaulingas. Kiti dokumentai paėmė istoriją. Laikraštis "The Times" ilgame pranešime teigė, kad "Comnussioners" nebuvo pasirengę įsipareigoti, kad Parlamentas ar bet kuri kita viešoji institucija turėtų galimybę apsvarstyti bet kokią schemą, skirtą statyti medieną vietoje.<br/><br/>Situacija truko aštuoniolika mėnesių, kol bažnytiniai komisarai buvo priversti pradėti tyrimą, kuris prasidėjo Highgate 1895 m. Gegužės 31 d., Vadovaujant bažnytinio komisaro padėjėjui. Tyrimo metu buvo gauta daugybė laikraščių laiškų, iš kurių šis buvo pats svarbiausias.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 1895 m. birželio 5 d.<br/><br/>VANDALIZMAS HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Gerbiamasis Pone,<br/><br/>Vienas iš gražiausių miško bitai suburan Londone gresia. Ar galite padėti mums apsisaugoti nuo to, kas būtų nelaimė, ne tik artimiausio rajono, bet ir visos tankiai apgyvendintos Šiaurės Londone? Nė vienoje metropolio dalyje statybininkas nebuvo aktyvesnis nei Crouch End ir Hornsey. Prieš metus ar du gražios pievos dabar yra namai ir parduotuvės. Balasto krūvos užėmė didingų guolių ir kaštonų vietą, o kažkada malonūs kaimai dalijasi Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury ir Islington likimu.<br/><br/>---- Objektas yra dviejų keturiasdešimt pėdų kelių statyba per mišką. Mes šiame rajone žinome keturiasdešimt pėdų kelių per mišką reikšmę. Tai reiškia, kad miškai yra pasmerkti. Prieš dešimt metų agitacija išgelbėjo seserų medieną iš šešiasdešimt penkių akrų - žvyro duobę miškai - ir niekas, kuris matė Bank Holiday minios flocking iki Archway Road nuo niūrių gatvių Holloway, Islington ir Clerkenwell, ir Komisaras buvo malonus malonumas iš kitų vaikų ir šeimos vakarėlių papildymas iškylą ant žolės ir tarp medžių. ----<br/><br/>Bažnytiniai įgaliotiniai valdo beveik trečdalį didelės Hornsey parapijos. Liberaliomis tarifų išlaidomismokėtojų pinigai atveriant kelius ir bendrą rajono plėtrą, jų turto vertė labai padidėjo, ir iš šio neuždirbto prieaugio kiekvienais metais jie gauna dideles pajamas. Žinoma, palūkanų mokėtojai, kurių pinigai tokiu būdu padėjo sukurti didžiulį turtą, gali tikėtis liberalaus elgesio mainais.<br/><br/>Paklusniai Tave,<br/><br/>Pasirašė Šv. Jokūbo vikaras, Muswell Hill, Parko koplyčios ministras, Crouch End, Onslow Gardens gyvenantis baristeris ir trys apygardos tarybos nariai.<br/><br/>Tai buvo šūvis tiesiai per bažnytinių komisarų lankus, jų pačių religiniai vadovai ir rajono taryba, visi su ginklu, iš esmės sakant, kad bažnyčia buvo per daug turtinga ir turėtų būti labdaringa, o ne godi. Dviejų dvasininkų įtraukimas buvo gudrus žingsnis. Atminkite, kad tai vis dar buvo Darvino ginčų aukštyje. Darvinas buvo suskaldęs tikėjimą Bažnyčios mokymais ir daugelis žmonių būtų pasipiktinę Bažnyčios galia vien šiuo požiūriu. Bažnyčia nebuvo tokia saugi, kokia buvo apsimetusi.<br/><br/>Vakaro žinios, 1895 m. birželio 7 d., rašė:<br/><br/>Jei bažnytiniai bendradarbiai nebus sprendžiami iš karto, pastato aštuonkojai gaus medienos sukibimą, kurį vėliau bus labai sunku atlaisvinti, ---. Todėl londoniečiai turi būti ir daryti, jei jie išgelbėtų vieną iš jų labiausiai žavingų kaimiškų peizažų. Viešasis tyrimas atidedamas iki kito ketvirtadienio, o prieš tai reikia ką nors padaryti, kad Komisijos nariai būtų įtikinti, jog Londono piliečiai netoleruos vienos iš jų mėgstamų žaidimų aikštelių konfiskavimo.<br/><br/>Kitą dieną „Daily Chronicle“ išspausdintame laiške rašoma:<br/><br/>..... Tai buvo su dideliu palengvėjimu, kad gyventojai, maždaug prieš dešimt metų, išgirdo, kad Aukštutinio medžio pirkimas buvo įvykdytas; ir kaip malonus palaima tai įrodė, kiekvienas, kuris juos aplankė, gali paliudyti, bet visi, kurie stengėsi išsaugoti šiuos viršutinius miškus, kurie yra vakarinėje Muswell Hill kelio pusėje, manė, kad jų pergalė buvo neužbaigta tol, kol šešiasdešimt akrų ant kelio. Tai buvo nelaimingas atsitikimas, kad miškai yra padalinti plačiu aukštu keliu. Ar kas nors gali abejoti, koks būtų poveikis, jei Churchyard Bottom Wood būtų pakeistas eilėmis mažų vilų, kurių kiekviena siunčia savo indėlį dūmų ir suodžių? Ar kas nors gali suabejoti ir tuo, kokį didelį skirtumą tai padarytų įsigijusių miškų vaizdingoje aplinkoje, jei eilė naujų namų būtų pastatyta tiesiai priešais jų lapinę prieangį?<br/><br/>Tai išreiškia daugelio žmonių nuomonę. Tiesą sakant, žvyro iškastas medis, kurį rašytojas vadina „aukštesniuoju medžiu“, bažnytinės komisijos nebuvo nupirktas, bet perduotas rajonui, tai jie turėjo kartoti ne kartą per metus, tačiau dauguma žmonių tai ignoravo. Komisija neketino atsisakyti antros medienos, kad ir ką kas sakytų, ir laikėsi šios pozicijos iki galo.<br/><br/>H. S. Chamberlain iš 5 Cranley Gardens 1895 m. birželio 8 d. laiške The Times paragino pirkti.<br/><br/>Aš žinau, kad tai yra įprasta kalbėti šiurkščiai apie bažnytinius komisarus, bet kaip fondo patikėtiniai jie yra įpareigoti jį administruoti, kad gautų didžiausią naudą, ir todėl, jei jau būtų padaryta keletas dalykų, kad išsaugotų medienos griovimą, man atrodo, kad tai gali būti padaryta tik perkant turtą iš bendradarbių, kurie, aš žinau, yra visiškai laisvi.<br/><br/>(Tai reiškia "Crouch End Playing Fields", kuris buvo apsaugotas po kelerių metų.)<br/><br/>Kaip Muswell Hillo konservatorių asociacijos pirmininkas, aš nuolat palaikau ryšį su gyventojais ir galiu drąsiai teigti, kad kiekvienas kaimynystėje gyvenantis žmogus darys viską, kad išsaugotų.<br/><br/>(Viskas, ko jis asmeniškai norėjo, buvo labdaros pajamos, kad paremtų savo neturtingus žmones. Jis reikalavo savo akrų žemės - tikrai ne daug - jis tikėjo komisarų patikinimu, kad medienai negresia pavojus.)<br/><br/>"Muswell Hill Road buvo vienas iš geriausių Hornsey ir liktų toks pat gražus, namai ar ne namai",<br/><br/>(Ir tada atėjo didžioji retorika klestėti.)<br/><br/>"Ar vargšai kenčia dėl sentimentalių prieštaravimų ir isteriško vilko šauksmo, kurį ką tik iškėlė jūsų korespondentai? Kažkas turi būti padaryta ir tai netrukus. Žemės akras, pridėtas prie labdaros turto, nepadarytų reikšmingo skirtumo likusiai žemei, o iš jo gautas pelnas padėtų daugeliui neturtingų senų ir nusipelniusių žmonių jų nykimo metais ir leistų mums perduoti mūsų įpėdiniams turtą, kuris tolimoje ateityje būtų labai vertingas teikiant labdaros pagalbą nusipelniusiems Horno parapijos neturtingiesiems.<br/><br/>Skaitydami jo laišką, jaučiame isteriją labai arti paviršiaus. Kodėl jis manė, kad Komisijos nariai norėjo pastatyti kelią? Kodėl jie turėtų išleisti visus tuos pinigus, jei ne statyti namus? Jis niekada nesuprato, kad už akrą žemės visas miškas bus prarastas. Bet jis buvo su problema ilgą laiką. Jis buvo asmuo, kuriam komisarai prieš 25 000 metų pateikė pasiūlymą parduoti, ir tai yra jo vardas, kuris yra pagerbtas lentoje ant Crouch End laikrodžio bokšto, kad išsaugotų medieną, tačiau jo pasitikėjimas bažnytiniais komisarais atrodo naivus. Liūdna, kad per apklausą jis turėjo būti išmestas kaip velnias.<br/><br/>Tęsiamas tyrimas<br/><br/>Atidėtas atidarymas Highgate 1895 m. Birželio 15 d. Laukiant didelio susirinkimo, Tarybos rūmai buvo visiškai pakeisti. Įprasti stalai buvo pašalinti, o kambarys užpildytas kėdėmis. Pusę septynių salė buvo perpildyta, o žmonės žongliravo vietomis.<br/><br/>P. Murray, komisaras, sakė, kad tyrimas buvo tikrai paprasta. Hornsey parapijos labdaros norėjo įsigyti žemės sklypą, kuris ribojasi su jų labdaros turtą gale. Klausimas buvo, ar labdaros komisija, kuri kontroliavo visas labdaros organizacijas, turėjo pakankamai galių jas sustabdyti. Bažnyčios įgaliotiniai buvo pasirengę parduoti žemę labai palankiomis sąlygomis, o labdaros pajamos būtų labai padidintos.<br/><br/>Prieš tai buvo trijų klasių prieštaravimai.<br/><br/>Pradinis pasitikėjimas buvo skirtas neturtingiems namams suteikti, tačiau patikėtiniai pasiūlė statyti vilas, kurios būtų per brangios neturtingiesiems. Tačiau tai buvo per patikėtinių teisę keisti Trust sąlygas, kad jie galėtų statyti vilas, jei jie manė, kad vargšas būtų naudinga, galų gale. Patys neturtingi žmonės galėjo paprieštarauti, tačiau liberalios nuostatos jiems jau buvo pažadėtos. Trečiasis prieštaravimas buvo susijęs su estetine ir viešąja klausimo puse. Iš to, ką skaitė, jis padarė išvadą, jog Labdaros komisija turi kištis, kad neleistų bažnytiniams komisarams naudotis savo nuožiūra tvarkant savo turtą.<br/><br/>Tyrime buvo aptariami smulkūs klausimai, tačiau kalbėtojai vis grįždavo prie pagrindinės problemos, kaip užkirsti kelią bet kokiam medienos sunaikinimui. Islingtono Vestry tarnautojas, atstovaujantis 300 000 žmonių, oficialiai protestavo dėl bet kurios medienos dalies, kuri yra tokia vertinga Islingtono ir Hornsey žmonėms, kurie buvo naudojami asmeniniais tikslais. Wilfred White sakė, kad jei komisarai duos jiems laiko, jie galės surinkti pinigus, kad kompensuotų patikėtiniams.<br/><br/>Ponas Beaumontas sakė, kad jie nenori vilų, jie nori kotedžų neturtingiems žmonėms, kurie buvo išvaryti iš rajono. Kiti sakė, kad nėra pinigų statyti kotedžus pakeisti dabartinius apleistus, bet vilos būtų ekonominis pasiūlymas. Kiti atkirto, kad Highgate yra daugybė vilų, kurias galima leisti. Mediena buvo šventa. Pakalbėkime apie mišką.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher sakė tarp dirbančių žmonių šauksmas buvo, kad nėra kur eiti. Darbuotojai atėjo pas jį su šauksmu: "Mes išstumti iš Highgate ir priversti eiti į Highgate New Town." Jei buvo parduotas Muswell Hill Road fasadas, nebuvo jokių abejonių, kad keliai gali būti nupjauti tiesiai per mišką Hornsey kryptimi, bet jei komisarai negalėjo gauti žemės iš Labdaros komisijos, jie negalėjo nupjauti kelio.<br/><br/>Jis buvo labai įsitikinęs, kad kotedžai gali būti pastatyti į tinkamą remonto būklę. Vargšai žmonės, policija ir keletas darbininkų klasių paprašė jo atstovauti šiuos du punktus, kad kotedžas buvo labai reikalingas Highgate ir kad jei jie vieną kartą leido žemę parduoti, nebuvo pasakyta, kur bus palikta statytojo ranka.<br/><br/>(Garsūs ir užsitęsę sveikinimai).<br/><br/>Daugybė kitų žmonių kalbėjo, o „Comnussioner“ apibendrino sakydamas, kad jis mano, kad vyraujanti nuomonė yra už kotedžų išsaugojimą, tačiau susitikimas neturėtų daryti jokių išvadų iš to, ką jis pasakė (Groans).<br/><br/>Kiti sakė, kad labdaros patikėtiniai nesugebėjo atlikti savo pareigų, leisdami namams nukristi.<br/><br/>J. R. Williamsas, anksčiau laikraščiui rašęs patikėtinį, sakė turįs geriausią įgaliojimą, kad Bažnyčios įgaliotiniai nedarytų jokių kelių ir iš labdaros įgaliotinių veiksmų negautų jokios naudos. Kiti buvo daug mažiau pasitikintys, o susitikimas baigėsi beveik po trijų valandų.<br/><br/>"Mes susiduriame su tuo, kad Highgate ir Muswell Hill yra žmonių, kurie nori Churchyard Bottom Wood skaičių ir nebus laimingi, kol jie gavo jį - o niekas, atrodo, nori išleisti farting mokėti už jį. Visi sako, kad būtų puiku turėti medieną kaip atvirą erdvę, bet visi mano, kad tai yra kažkieno pareiga. „Islington Vestry“ šiuo klausimu „išsprendė“, tačiau „Islington Vestry“ nesiūlo cento už pirkinį. Bendruomenei ar individui nėra sunkesnės problemos, kaip įgyti kitų žmonių nuosavybę, už ją nemokant.<br/><br/>Mokėti už tai iš tiesų buvo problema, nes Churchyard Bottom Wood tapo intensyvių vietinių ir nacionalinių diskusijų objektu. Siekiant surinkti pinigų medienai išsaugoti, buvo įkurtas jungtinis komitetas. 1896 m. Lapkričio 20 d. C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon iždininkas, rašė "The Standard", tuo metu dienraštyje, prašydamas pagalbos. Jis priminė visiems apie medienos praradimo pavojų ir sakė, kad jį galima išgelbėti tik perkant. Bažnyčios komisarai būtų parduoti už £25,000 ir papildomai (5000 būtų reikalaujama tvoros ir drenažo, todėl £30,000 iš viso. Tai buvo per daug Hornsey taryba pakelti, bet jie jau balsavo £10,000 link viso. Miškai buvo neįkainojami visiems Šiaurės Londone, todėl jis kreipėsi į viešąsias įstaigas ir privačius asmenis, kad surinktų likusius 20 000 svarų. Jis perspėjo, kad dabartinis Bažnyčios įgaliotinių pasiūlymas buvo atviras tik iki 1898 m. Pabaigos. Po to statybininkai persikraustė.<br/><br/>Apeliacinį skundą šiltai pasveikino spauda. Privatus įstatymo projektas buvo skubotas per parlamentą, o 1897 m. Highgate Woods išsaugojimo įstatymas tapo įstatymu. Conunittee dabar turėjo teisę reklamuoti įnašus į medienos pirkimą ir išsaugojimą.<br/><br/>Per gana trumpą laiką beveik visi pinigai buvo surinkti, tačiau paskutinius kelis tūkstančius buvo labai sunku surinkti, o Komisijos narių terminas buvo tik kelios savaitės. J. Cory-Wrightas parašė pareiškimą ilgesniam laikui, tačiau jam buvo suteiktas tik trijų mėnesių laikotarpis ir tik tada, jei už papildomą laikotarpį buvo mokamos 4 proc. palūkanos nuo visos sumos. Galų gale Londono apskrities taryba, kuri iš pradžių pasiūlė 2500 svarų sterlingų, tai padarė iki 5000 svarų sterlingų, o bendra suma buvo pasiekta, tačiau tai buvo artimas dalykas.<br/><br/>Taryba nusprendė pervadinti medį „Karalienės mišku“ karalienės Viktorijos deimantinio jubiliejaus ir Hornsey garbei, kai Albanijos kunigaikštienė oficialiai paskelbė, kad medis yra atviras „laisvai naudoti visiems laikams“.<br/><br/>Nors „Churchyard Bottom Wood“ gelbėjimo kampaniją vykdė ir jai vadovavo vietiniai žmonės, kurie aistringai domėjosi šia miško dalimi, jie kreipėsi pagalbos ir patirties į didžiulį žmonių tinklą, iš kurių kai kurie dirbo kartu panašiose kampanijose daugiau nei trisdešimt metų. Komitetas paskelbė kreipimąsi, išspausdintą ant labai geros kokybės popieriaus ir su keliais žinomais vardais.<br/><br/>Atviros erdvės ir visuomenės sveikatos klausimai buvo pagrindiniai Viktorijos vizijos dalykai.<br/><br/>Atvirų erdvių judėjimas<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, puikus būsto reformatorius, kuris pradėjo su trimis senais namais Marylebone, kuriuos jai nupirko Jolmas Ruskinas, greitai tapo neturtingų žmonių būsto ekspertu kuo sveikiausiomis sąlygomis. Jos būdas buvo pirkti nuomą, o tada nugriauti kai kuriuos perpildytus namus, kad šviesa ir oras būtų likęs, manydamas, kad grynas oras ir saulės šviesa buvo vienintelis būdas išgelbėti neturtingus žmones nuo "perdėto karščiavimo". Ji to išmoko dar būdama vaikas iš savo senelio, Southwood Smith, kuris savo teorijas išplėtojo Karaliaus kryžiaus karščiavimo ligoninėje.<br/><br/>Jis pastatė pirmuosius pramoninius būstus neturtingiems žmonėms ir statistiškai įrodė, kad geras oras ir tinkamas drenažas išgelbėjo gyvybes. „Gibson Gardens“, esantis Northwold Road, yra tiesioginis „Southwood Smith“ idėjų rezultatas. Daugiau informacijos apie „Gibson Gardens“<br/><br/>Atviro oro svarba<br/><br/>Atviros erdvės ir galimybė kvėpuoti švariu oru buvo būtinos žmonėms, gyvenantiems viename ar dviejuose perpildytuose kambariuose. Octavia Hill paėmė savo kaltinimus iš Lisson Grove lūšnynų, iki Fitzjohn's Avenue į Hampstead Heath. Ji taip mylėjo Fitzjohn Avenue laukus, kad ji bandė juos nusipirkti kaip viešąjį parką. Jie turėjo kainuoti £ 10 000, o per tris rugpjūčio savaites buvo iškelta £ 8500. Reikėjo tik vasaros atostogų pabaigos ir grįžimo iš užjaučiančių draugų atostogų ir dar 1500 svarų sterlingų, tačiau savininkai staiga atsiėmė savo pasiūlymą. Nepaisant visų prašymų, laukai buvo padengti dideliais namais.<br/><br/>Iš to buvo sukurta kampanija, skirta išsaugoti Parlamento kalną, kitą atvirą erdvę į šiaurę nuo Lisson Grove, supirkdami laukus statybininkų kelyje, kad būtų sukurta nuolatinė virvė sanitarinė prieš besiplečiančias plytas. Parlamento Hill Fields kampanija buvo toks sėkmingas, kad Hampstead Heath Bill buvo priimtas ir ten buvo pinigų per nuo apeliacinio skundo. Iš šių pinigų ir į atvirų erdvių postūmis, buvo sukurti National Trust. Octavia Hill daugelį metų buvo suinteresuota apsaugoti tokias vietoves kaip bažnyčios dugno medis, todėl ji buvo natūrali sąjungininkė kovoje išsaugoti medį.<br/><br/>Bendruomenių apsaugos draugija taip pat buvo susipažinusi su tokio pobūdžio agitacija ir pinigų surinkimu. Jie turėjo nugriauti tvorą, kai dvaro valdovai uždarė bendros žemės sklypus, vesdami tiek teisėtus, tiek neteisėtus mūšius prieš arogantišką tradiciškai laisvos žemės privatizavimą. Robert Hunter, jų garbės advokatas nuo 1868 m., visada buvo susijęs su atvirų erdvių, didelių ar mažų, užtikrinimu visuomenei. Jis, dabar seras Robert Hunter, tapo Bažnyčios Apeliacinio komiteto pirmininku. Bendruomenių apsaugos draugijos pirmininkas buvo ponas Shaw-Lefevre MP (vėliau Lordas Eversley), kuris suvaidino svarbų vaidmenį šioje ir kitose kampanijose Bendruomenių rūmuose. Octavia Hill buvo įtrauktas į jų darbą nuo maždaug 1875 m.<br/><br/>Tuo pačiu metu Octavia Hill buvo kampanija už laidojimo įstatymo projektą.<br/><br/>Miesto šventorių buvo tiek daug ir jie tapo tokie pavojingi sveikatai, užteršdami šulinius, iš kurių žmonės traukė geriamąjį vandenį, kad miesto laidotuvės nebebuvo leidžiamos. Vietoj to miesto pakraštyje buvo sukurtos kapinės. Abney Parko kapinės buvo viena iš jų. Tada buvo judėjimas pašalinti kapų akmenis į senamiesčio kapinių kraštus, iš naujo įterpti kūnus kitur ir paversti kapines į sodus ir atviras erdves, o ne statyti ant jų. Ši žemė centriniame Londone buvo labai vertinga ir spekuliantai troško ją gauti: net kvakeriai pastatė vieną iš savo kapinių ir grasino tai padaryti dar kartą, statydami Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill turėjo sąjungininkų tinklą tuziną laukų, todėl jos pagalba išgelbėti Bažnyčios dugno medis turėjo būti neįkainojama.<br/><br/>1882 m. įkurta Metropoliteno sodų draugija 1890 m. miesto centruose įrengė apie du šimtus mažų sodų, kuriuos vėliau perdavė vietos valdžiai, todėl nuo pat pradžių buvo užtikrinta jų parama bažnytiniam apeliacijai „Bottom Wood“.<br/><br/>Kirlo visuomenė dabar yra užmiršta, tačiau savo laiku ji turėjo didelę įtaką miestų planavimui ir atviros erdvės teisės aktams. Draugija buvo įkurta apie 1875 m. „Grožio sklaidai“, kad įneštų spalvų ir susidomėjimo į žmonių, gyvenančių nuobodžioje, drabužinėje aplinkoje, gyvenimą. Ryški sienų spalva ir apdaila, geras dainavimas, atviros erdvės, gamta, literatūra ir menas. Visa tai priklausė Draugijos kompetencijai. Buvo Dekoratyvinė filialas, kuriam William Morris skaitė paskaitas; Muzikinis filialas, skatinantis chorų ir laimingų vakarų žmonėms vietos mokyklų pastatuose; ir Literatūros filialas. Laikraštyje „The Times“ draugija reguliariai kreipdavosi į „turtingesnes klases“ knygoms ir periodiniams leidiniams, kurie būtų platinami berniukų ir mergaičių klubams, išmaldos namams ir kitur, tačiau aktyviausias buvo Atvirų erdvių komitetas. Pats vardas "Kyrle" kilęs iš popiežiaus "Ross Man", filantropo, kuris davė savo gimtinę žmonėms kaip viešąjį parką. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life.

Ir aš dar kartą dėkoju savo vyrui Edui už tai, kad man padarė visą klipą.<br/><br/>Padėkos Raštas Making<br/><br/>Kaip rodo pavadinimas, šis žaidimas yra apie tai, kaip kurti modelius. Mažieji tik mokosi apie modelius, gali tiesiog suderinti paveikslėlius ant modelio juostelių, o kiti gali tęsti modelį su paveikslėlių kortelėmis ant tuščių juostelių.<br/><br/>Norėdami sukurti failo aplanką, norite iškirpti paveikslėlių tinklelį, kad būtų galima padaryti kortelės gabalus. Aš rekomenduoju laminuoti juos, kad jie ilgiau tarnautų. Tada įklijuokite modelio juosteles į aplanką.<br/><br/>Aš taip pat norėjau turėti tuščias modelio juosteles, kad mergaitės galėtų pamatyti, kur tęsti modelį ir kiek išdėstyti. Aš pritvirtinau juos prie aplanko šono, naudodamas juostą, kad jie galėtų sulankstyti, kad supakuotų žaidimą ir išplėstų modelį.<br/><br/>Aš taip pat pridėjau papildomą tuščią, kad mergaitės taip pat galėtų sukurti savo modelį.<br/><br/>Turkija Skaičių žaidimas<br/><br/>Šiame žaidime merginos į kalakuto kūną prideda plunksnas, tuo pat metu praktikuodamas skaičiavimą ir skaičių atpažinimą. Aš naudoju bespalves plunksnas kaip vadovą, kur pridėti plunksnas ir kad merginos galėtų atitikti numerius. Ir būkite tikri, kad klijuodami kalakuto kūną, jūs klijuojate tik centre, kad sparno gabalai galėtų slysti po kūnu.<br/><br/>Kai visos plunksnos yra išdėstytos, mes praktikuojame paprastą aritmetiką, pvz., Paimame tris plunksnas ir matome, kiek liko, tada pridedant dvi atgal, kad pamatytume, kas yra lygi.<br/><br/>Be juodų ir baltų sparnų, mes taip pat įtraukėme bespalvį kalakutą, jei norite, kad mažieji turėtų savo spalvų rinkinį. Vietoj failo aplanko žaidimo galite paversti tai į amatą, dažydami gabalus, iškirpdami juos ir klijuodami juos kartu.<br/><br/>Kitas variantas yra naudoti gabalus, kad būtų sukurta veltinio lentos istorija.

Mano ikimokyklinio gyvenimo aš buvau mokytojas ir dabar aš homeschool mūsų vaikai. Aš taip pat vedęs Ed, kuris šiuo metu tarnauja oro pajėgų, ir yra mano gyvenimo meilė (tai būtų nepatogu, jei jis nebuvo). Mūsų šeima yra didelė knygų, amatų, ir smagiai kartu.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alkoholio vartojimas asmenims iki 21 metų amžiaus buvo nustatytas kaip pagrindinė visuomenės sveikatos problema. Tyrimai pažymi, kad tai padidina neįgalumo riziką ir gali pakenkti besivystančioms smegenims. Nepilnamečiai, kurie geria, yra labiau linkę nusižudyti, pažeisti įstatymus ar būti smurto aukomis. Alkoholis yra susijęs su beveik trečdaliu jaunimo eismo mirčių. Apskaičiuota, kad bendra metinė nepilnamečių girtavimo kaina yra 62 milijardai JAV dolerių. Nors dauguma įstatymų, skirtų užkirsti kelią nepilnamečių girtavimui, priimami valstybės lygmeniu, federaliniu lygmeniu buvo vykdoma teisėkūros veikla ir susidomėjimas remti valstybių pastangas pažaboti šią problemą. Šioje ataskaitoje aprašomas nepilnamečių alkoholio vartojimo mastas, pastarojo meto teisėkūros veikla šiuo klausimu ir įvairios politikos pasekmės. Ji bus atnaujinta, kai bus gauta naujų duomenų. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: tikras maistas<br/><br/>Praėjusią savaitę rašiau apie Šiaurės šalių maisto manifestą ir kaip Danija sukūrė stiprią „tikrojo maisto“ kultūrą daugiausia iš tyčinių Clauso Meyerio pastangų. Maisto reformą lėmė ne politinis lobizmas ar viešos peticijos, o paprastų žmonių pastangos, kurioms vadovavo piliečiai, turintys galią iš tikrųjų įgyvendinti ir stebėti pokyčius.<br/><br/>Užbaigiau pranešimą, kuriame užsiminta apie vieną klausimą: kodėl mums taip sunku tai padaryti patiems, kaip individams? Jei visa šalis gali įgyvendinti ir skleisti bendrą požiūrį į maistą, kodėl mes negalime?<br/><br/>Nėra nieko, kas iš tikrųjų sustabdytų mus nuo Danijos sėkmės imitavimo. Problema ta, kad mes esame užtvindyti tiek daug pranešimų apie tai, ką turėtume valgyti, ir kaip turėtume gyventi, sunku žinoti, kur pradėti. Taigi, o ne po sėkmingų sistemų, kurios buvo įrodyta, kad dirbti (pavyzdžiui, Šiaurės šalių maisto manifestas), dauguma žmonių šokinėti nuo dietos beprotybė dietos beprotybė, bando rasti "teisingą būdą valgyti."<br/><br/>Bet kaip Claus Meyer pavyko? Koks buvo slaptas padažas, padėjęs Manifestui? Ir ar protinga manyti, kad galime taikyti šias pamokas savo gyvenime? Tęsti svarstymą →<br/><br/>Pasidalink:<br/><br/>Mano peilis paniro į jautieną su garsiu lūžiu, pop ir šnypštimu.<br/><br/>"Whooaaaa!"<br/><br/>Aš pažvelgiau į savo seserį, kai mes abu juokėmės nustebę, ir toliau šypsojosi, kai baigiau pjaustyti savo pirmąjį įkandimą. Unikalus išorinis mėsos traškumas užleido puikiai sultingą interjerą, todėl garsas labiau panašus į pjaustymą į kalzoną nei maltos jautienos paštetas.<br/><br/>Mes sėdėjome Kopenhagos seniausiame bare, kuris jautėsi labiau kaip atsitiktinis bistro nei baras, ir aš ruošiausi išbandyti patiekalą, kurį rekomendavo mūsų padavėja / baras konkursas / savininkas?<br/><br/>"Paryžiaus jautiena, tai labai gerai," sakė ji.
