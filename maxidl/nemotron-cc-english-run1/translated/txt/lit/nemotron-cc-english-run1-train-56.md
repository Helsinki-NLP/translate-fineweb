| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Pripažįstant, kad neįmanoma ginčytis su kuo nors, kad mylėtų kažką, ko jie nekenčia, ir atvirkščiai, vis dar dažnai malonu bandyti ginčytis. Kai mes kalbame su žmonėmis, kurių nuomonė tiesiogiai prieštarauja mūsų nuomonei, mes esame priversti ginti savo skonį, apibrėžti savo nuomonę ir analizuoti, kodėl mes reaguojame taip, kaip mes darome. Štai kodėl mes turime „Kodėl tau tai nepatinka?“, kuriame du mūsų darbuotojai bandys išsiaiškinti, ar žmonės, turintys priešingas nuomones, gali peržengti „Ne, jūs klystate!“ ir turėti pilietinę, konstruktyvią ir galbūt net įtikinamą diskusiją apie jų nesutarimus. Nes nesvarbu, ką sako radijas, vis dar yra vidurys tarp "Mes visiškai sutinkame" ir "Aš teisus, ir jūs esate kvailas ir blogis".<br/><br/>Scott: Nuo tada, kai aptarinėjau savo „Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World“ apostazę, mes ieškojome atvejo, kai galiu jus paskambinti, nes nepatinka kažkas nuostabaus, ir mums nereikėjo ilgai ieškoti. Mes sėdėjome vienas šalia kito Martino Scorsese "Hugo" metu - aš, visiškai sužavėtas savo fantastiniu duoklė ankstyvojo tylaus kino stebuklams, ir jūs, matyt, priešinosi kiekvienam posūkiui. Kritinis sutarimas buvo mano pusėje: jis pasiekė Nr. 9 vietą mūsų kolektyviniame Top 15 (nors jūs jį įrašėte kaip savo pervertintą pasirinkimą), laimėjo (ar pateikė) įvairius kino kritikų apdovanojimus ir šiuo metu turi 83 balus Metacritic. Žinoma, tai nereiškia, kad jūs klystate, bet atsakomybė tenka jums, kad paaiškintumėte, kodėl Hugo buvo, jūsų žodžiais, „tuščiaviduris ir dirbtinis“, kur daugelis iš mūsų matė tai kaip mielą Scorsese vaikystės ir terpės paminėjimą, kai ji dar buvo kūdikystėje. Ir prašau būkite švelnūs, kai jūs perplėšiate šį drugelį nuo sparnų.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Aš negaliu būti švelnus, Scott. Kartais skauda mažiau, jei iš karto ištraukiate "Band-Aid". (Ir net jei tai nėra, kas nori vaikščioti aplink, dėvėdamas pusiau suplėšytą "Band-Aid"? Bruto.) Faktas yra tas, kad aš atradau, jog Hugo yra nuobodus manipuliacinis pratimas klastotėje, pradedant nuo jo atidarymo slydimo per Paryžiaus traukinių stotį, kuris man labiau nei bet kas priminė Roberto Zemeckio „The Polar Express“. Skirtingai nuo Mike D'Angelo, aš esu ilgo, nepertraukiamo gerbėjas, kuris yra būdas sukurti erdvę ir paskatinti žiūrovus nesąmoningai sulaikyti kvėpavimą, kai fotoaparatas tyrinėja plotą; bet kai erdvė yra ištirta, yra slidus, blizgus CGI kūrimas, o fotoaparatas plūduriuoja be svorio per jį be fizinio jausmo, kad arba fotoaparatas, arba aplinka tikrai nori žaisti. Likusi filmo dalis man atrodė lygiai taip pat be porų ir nereali tiek savo aplinka, tiek labai sugalvota maudlin istorija.<br/><br/>Aš nebūtinai turiu problemų su pagaminta, stilizuota aplinka filme. Man patiko Baz Luhrmann’o vienodai plintantis, visiškai dirbtinis Paryžiaus užėmimas, pavyzdžiui, Moulin Rouge, bet šis filmas turi savo absurdiškumo jausmą, humoro jausmą apie tai, kaip sąmoningai jis yra virš viršaus. Kalbant apie Jean-Pierre Jeunet stilizavimą, ypač Amelijoje. (Ir Jeunet, ir Luhrmannas čia jautėsi kaip stiprios vizualinės įtakos.) Tačiau supratau, kad Martinas Scorsese norėjo, kad aš visiškai rimtai žiūrėčiau į Hugo. Nors tai dar viena sentimentali istorija apie našlaitį, kuris sugrąžina spalvą į seno kurmudžono gyvenimą. Ir aš tiesiog negalėjau.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Filme nėra nieko, kas man labiau patiktų, nei būti nustebintam. Ir nėra nieko, kas man sukeltų pasipiktinimą ir pasipriešinimą, kaip būti atvirai manipuliuojamam, garsiai pasakotam, ką ir kada jausti. Geras filmas daro tokį dalyką subtiliai; blogas naudoja kritimo muzikos užuominas ir saldus stygas - ir šiuo atveju, grubus, didžiulis akis, neryškus našlaitis, apgailėtinai žvelgdamas į fotoaparatą - reikalauti patoso ir pasakyti žiūrovams, kad jie yra siaubingi žmonės, jei jie to nepadaro pagal pareikalavimą. Nepaisant to, aš galiu susidoroti su liūdnais vaikais ir suaugusiais, kad gyvenimas būtų geresnis vienas kitam - aš iš tikrųjų iškasiau šių metų "Le Havre", kuris iš esmės buvo tas pats sklypas be visų malonumų, bet manau, kad dirbtinė aplinka blogai atspindi dirbtines emocijas, o kiekviena kita atrodo labiau netikra.<br/><br/>Pradėkime nuo to. Mūsų pamirštame filmų vaizdo įraše jūs ir Noel'is paėmėte Keith'ą į uždavinį nugalėti Tyrannosaur'ą, nes jūs jautėte, kad tai nebuvo pakankamai realistiška - per daug išgalvota, per daug apgailėtina, per daug tolima. Kaip gali būti, kad tu negali nusipirkti senos stymied alkūnės, kuri sulaužo daiktus, kai jis yra piktas, bet tu gali nusipirkti našlaitį, gyvenantį milžiniško traukinių stoties laikrodžio viduje, ir pradėti įnoringą kelionę, kad sutaisytų paslaptingą automatą, kuris, jo manymu, gali turėti paslapčių iš jo mirusio tėvo, bet kuris vietoj to veda jį į stebuklingą kelionę į savęs atradimą? Ar niekada neradote Hugo gaudyto rokoko dizaino, agresyvaus širdies stygų pjaustymo ar kablio krūvių, netgi šiek tiek pernelyg didelių ar sunkiai nuryjamų?<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet ir Luhrmann kaip įtakos Scorsese?! Pamirškite, kad yra nejautrus, dabar jūs sąmoningai poking man su aštriu lazda. Jei ieškote įkvėpimo Hugo - iš tikrųjų, jei ieškote emocinio Hugo branduolio - turite grįžti į Scorsese vaikystę Elizabeth gatvėje Mažojoje Italijoje, kur astma sergantis mažas berniukas, negalintis žaisti lauke su kitais vaikais, pasitraukė į Aleksandro Kordos fantazijas, tokias kaip Bagdado vagis. Arba, paprasčiau tariant, eikite tiesiai į patį šaltinį: George Méliès, kurio kelionė į Mėnulį yra visų kino fantazijų didysis sprogimas, tas momentas, kai fotoaparatas nebuvo naudojamas dokumentuoti pasaulį tokį, koks jis yra, bet kokia įnoringa, stebuklinga vieta, kurią kino kūrėjas nori išrasti. Ir ši tradicija buvo plėtojama ir plečiama dešimtmečius, kol Jeunet ir Luhrmann mėgstamos mažosios kojos pateko į ją.<br/><br/>Ir kalbant apie Jeunet, malonus bandymas atimti mano retorinį ginklą, bet aš vis tiek pasakysiu: kaip jūs galite mylėti Amélie, tačiau rasti Hugo sintetinį ir "pernelyg" ir "pavargęs manipuliuoti"? Jūs sakote, kad Amélie ir Moulin Rouge yra išpirkę „savo pačių juokingumo jausmą“, kai Scorsese reiškia, kad mes rimtai žiūrime į Hugo, ir aš nemanau, kad taip yra bent jau pastaruoju atveju. Tai, kad Scorsese jaučia akivaizdų aistrą filmams, yra, manau, kodėl jūs interpretavote Hugo kaip savigarbą. Bet man tai yra tie jausmai, kurie suteikia filmui emocinį balastą, kurio neturi Luhrmann ir Jeunet filmai. Visi trys filmai agresyviai naudoja CGI stebuklus, o "Scorsese" prideda 3D į mišinį, kad būtų puikus efektas, bet kur jūs ir aš skiriasi, yra nesvarumo klausimas. Sutinku, kad CGI turi atstumo efektą; pasauliai, sudaryti tik iš skaitmeninio plastilino, yra lankstūs iki taško, kur jie kartais neturi buvimo. Jūs paminėjote Hugo savo "Overrated" įraše mūsų "Best Of Film" kūrinyje kaip "CGI gimcrack" - puikus diskas ... kitam filmui.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Teisinga sakyti, kad Scorsese pastatė Hugo aplink standartinį klausimą, „širdies traukimo“ vaikų knygą / filmo siužetą: našlaitis praleidžia savo tėtį, sukuria savo mažą fantazijų pasaulį, gloms ant naujo draugo, įtikina traškią seną fuddy-duddy sušvelninti ir galbūt jį priimti. Bet tai tik pasakojimo skeletas, o Scorsese suteikia daug mėsos ir kraujo. Viena vertus, jūs negalite žiūrėti Hugo, vienišas berniukas, žvelgdamas iš laikrodžio bokštų į Paryžiaus traukinių stoties šurmulį, negalvodamas apie Scorsese, kitą vienišą berniuką, spokso iš savo miegamojo lango Elizabeth gatvėje. Ir net jei nesate pakankamai didelis kino moksliukas, kad sukurtumėte šį ryšį, aš tikrai manau, kad Hugo kelionė yra ne rasti naują tėvo figūrą, bet atkakliai su mechanine magija, kuri stovi kaip jo tėvo palikimas. Štai kas yra filmas: Vizijos atkaklumas, leidžiantis mums priimti iliuzinę pasaulio versiją 24 kadrais per sekundę, yra mokslas ir magija vienu metu. Hugo santykiai su Meliès yra ne apie tai, kad jis jaustųsi iki naujo tėčio, bet dalijantis bendru entuziazmu, senasis žmogus panardintas į kartėlį. Man tai yra daug unikalesnis kampas potencialiai parduotuvėje.<br/><br/>Net keli filmo kritikai, regis, nori pripažinti, kad kino istoriją ir Meljeso studiją primenančios scenos – su Michaelu Stuhlbargu kaip didvyrišku kino mokslininku! – buvo siaubingos. Geriausiu įmanomu būdu jis pajuto, kaip mano "Filmo istorijos 101" suspaudimas kolegijoje, pusmečio vertės klipų ir konteksto kondensavimas į kažką tarp montažo ir animuotos iššokančios knygos. Ir tai kalba apie išradingą filmo dizainą, kuris taip gražiai sluoksniuoja faktą ir fantaziją, kad tuo pačiu metu tai yra Meliès istorija ir kino gimimas, ir tik paprastas, prabangiai pagamintas kinematografinis stebuklas, kurį pats Scorsese būtų mylėjęs kaip vaikas. Ačiū Dievui, Hugo neseka „Jeunet/Luhrmann“ modeliu ir turi „savo juokingumo jausmą“. Kaip fantazijos žinovas sau, ar ne jūs sakote, kad yra verta žaisti jį tiesiai ir rimtai ir unbashed, o ne mirksi auditoriją? Jums gali rasti Hugo liguistai saldus, bet aš nemanau, kad jos sentimentų autentiškumas turi būti paneigtas.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Taip, aš iš tikrųjų rasti dalis Hugo kerintis. (Atkreipkite dėmesį, kaip aš atsakau į jūsų klausimą iš priekio, o jūs buvote per daug užsiėmę su apopleksija spręsti mano, nors aš manau, kad tai pats atsakymas. Gerai, "įtaka" gali pervertinti bylą - aš tiesiog reiškė, kad vizualinis stilius atrodė labai pažįstamas. Nors, kaip pažymėjo Keithas, kai jūs asmeniškai iškėlėte tai, Scorsese nėra nei priešintis įkvėpimui iš kitų žmonių vizualizacijų, nei apsaugotas nuo jo.) Visų pirma, mane sužavėjo dalys, susijusios su Georgeso Melíèso istorija, jo meile kinui, kūriniu, kurį jis įdėjo į savo meną, ir džiaugsmu, kurį jis gavo iš jo. Povandeninio teismo scenoje iš Méliès „Fairyland“ yra daug grožio ir linksmybių, o pabaigoje seka, sutelkiant dėmesį į Méliès filmuotą medžiagą. Sutinku, kad Hugo ryšys su Meliès dėl bendros meilės filmui yra gražus prisilietimas. Ir aš mėgaujuosi geru filmu apie filmų kūrimą.<br/><br/>Bet Hugo nėra visų pirma apie filmą, nepaisant Méliès kaklaraiščių. Be jūsų cituojamų temų, tai taip pat yra apie jūsų tikslo suradimą, nes simboliai aiškiai paaiškina vienas kitą ir mus. Ir tai apie spektaklį, ir didelių veiksmų rinkiniai, ir vejasi, ir laimingai-visada-po pabaigos, kur net piktas chuliganas ir drovus vyresnio amžiaus pora ir fergawdsakes net kaprizingas Taksas visi gauti suporuotas su žavinga meilės interesus iki galo. Tai apie super-ankstyvą Hermionos Grangerio tipą, kuris yra bosiškas ir žvalus, protingas ir giria magiškus pasaulius, esančius knygose. Ir visa tai yra galingas pažįstamas ir galingas dirbtinis.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Taip, Scorsese žaidžia su archetipais. Problema yra ta, kad aš niekada nejaučiau, kad jis juos pripildė nieko naujo, šviežios ar tikėtinos, nepaisant jo paties istorijos. Man labiau patiktų pasakojimas apie jauną Scorsese, augantį su astma - kažką nedidelio ir realaus, be didžiulių kambarių, pilnų CGI laikrodžių ir auksinių žėrinčių dulkių-motų ir pranašiškų svajonių, ir pasibjaurėtino suaugusio tirono sargybinio, turinčio aukso širdį - visa tai pernelyg didelė, virš aukščiausios nesąmonės. Jūs ir toliau cituojate Scorsese asmeninį foną ir meilę filmui kaip įrodymą, kad jis tikrai jaučia tai, ką jis deda į ekraną, bet aš nejaučiu jo asmeninio prisilietimo nė viename iš šių dalykų, išskyrus akimirkas, kurios yra aiškiai apie filmą. Pagrindinės emocijos gali būti realios, tačiau tai nereiškia, kad egzekucija yra mažiau klaidinga.<br/><br/>Jūs sakote, kad emocijų autentiškumas negali būti paneigtas. Aš neabejoju, ar Scorsese asmeniškai jautėsi vienišas ir izoliuotas kaip vaikas, bet aš nejaučiu vienatvės ir izoliacijos ekrane - matau krūva perdėtų signifikatorių (Hugo yra purvinas ir jo drabužiai yra dėvimi, ir visi suaugusieji šaukia jam ir jis reguliariai persekioja baisus šuo!) ir dideli ritmai, su šauksmais ir verksmu. Man nuoširdumas yra labiau įtikinantis ir asmeniškesnis, kai jis yra tylus ir tiesioginis; kai kas nors šaukia savo nuomonę į mane, manau, kad jis yra tikrai piktas, arba tiesiog bando užvaldyti mano jausmus, kad neleistų man išreikšti savo nuomonės. Hugo buvo vienas ilgas šauksmas, kiek man rūpėjo.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Kodėl aš negavau to apgaulės jausmo iš Amélie, paklausi tu? Aš visiškai pripažinsiu, kad Amelie ir Moulin Rouge yra didelės, manipuliacinės, dirbtinės konstrukcijos toje pačioje venoje, reikalaujančios konkrečių emocijų tam tikrais intervalais ir bando parduoti tas emocijas su sunkiu emocijomis ir agresyviu garso takeliu. Nė vienas iš jų iš tikrųjų neparduoda man savo emocijų kaip autentiško žmogiško jausmo. Tai, kas man patiko šiuose dviejuose filmuose, buvo konstrukcija, ypač Amelie galvosūkiai, juokingi atsitiktinių savybių ir patirties sąrašai, apibūdinantys jos vaidybą, ir Moulin Rouge muzikinės magijos magija ir retekstualizacijos. Aš dažnai parduodu istorijas, kurios daro kūrybingus ar ambicingus dalykus su struktūra, ir abu šie filmai atitinka reikalavimus, kur Hugo yra daug linijinis, standartinis vaiko ieškojimas.<br/><br/>Bet galų gale, man, tai tikrai ateina į jausmą, kad tie filmai yra goofs, o Hugo yra skirtas būti vertinamas rimtai kiekvieną sekantį momentą. Jūs nemanote, kad tai tiesa, bet jūs tuo pačiu metu ginate jo vientisumą, kalbant apie jo absoliučiai autentišką, įsišaknijusią Scorsese istorinę emociją, ir pasakykite man, kad aš klystu, ir jis nereiškia, kad jis turi būti vertinamas rimtai. Kaip suderinti šiuos du teiginius? Ką apie filmą siūlo jums, kad jis nėra skirtas būti priimtas nominaliąja verte? Ir ar gali būti, kad tai tik dar viena keista Bendžamino Buttono istorija, kai matau, kad vaikai didelio biudžeto filmuose dažniausiai būna apkūnūs ir melodramatiški, o jūs, kaip tėtis, apeinate savo cinizmą ir einate tiesiai prie savo šeimos jausmo?<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Scott: Nemanau, kad aš turėjau omenyje, kad Scorsese nereiškia, kad reikia rimtai vertinti; tai tik tai, kad jis pasirinko įnoringą transporto priemonę, per kurią išreikšti rimtą meilę filmams. Kai sakai, "Bet Hugo nėra visų pirma apie filmą, nepaisant Meliès kaklaraiščių," aš esu paslaptingas. Sutinku, kad rasite daug elementų Hugo pernelyg pažįstamas ir sunkus ir pilnas Spielbergo stebuklų - nieko negaliu padaryti, kad ginčyčiausi dėl šio suvokimo, kurį dalijasi kiti Hugo abejotojai. Kartais filmas reiškia žavesį ir žavesį, o kai kuriems tai nėra; jūs turite Hugo ir aš turiu Amélie, nors manau, kad pastarasis, sąmoningai dirbtinis, reiškia, kad mes jį rasime romantišką. (Vietoj to, tarkim, kažkokia siaubinga mechaninė kontracepcija tinka pjūklo tęsiniui.)<br/><br/>Bet pasakyti, kad Hugo pirmiausia kalba ne apie filmą? Jei ne apie filmą, tai beprasmiškai diskursyvi istorija apie tai, ką tu galvoji apie tai. Hugo ir Meliès santykiai yra filmo širdis, o tai yra ne tik tam tikras ryšys tarp „Plucky Orphan“ ir „Crusty Old Guy“ su aukso širdimi, bet ir bendras giminingumas sukurtai magijai, ypač filmų magijai. Manau, kad Scorsese ir jo bendradarbiai rado būdą išreikšti savo entuziazmą per pirmąsias kino dienas per fantaziją, kuri yra prieinama visoms amžiaus grupėms. Archetipo užpildyta vaikų pasaka yra tik pluta čia; kinas yra pyragas. (Mmmm... pėdos.)<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Kalbant apie „Curious Case Of Benjamin Button“, aš nematau daug ryšio, išskyrus bandymą atskleisti mane kaip Benjamin Button gynėją, kaip būdą pakenkti mano patikimumui. (Beje, kokie yra to G.I. Joe priedai: „Cobra Blu-ray“ kilimas?) Aš jums sakiau, kad mieguistas naujasis tėtis manyje galbūt buvo pažeidžiamas Bendžamino Buttono, bet aš negaliu įsivaizduoti laiko, kai senėjimas atvirkščiai manęs nepajudintų. Ir, be to, nematau, kaip Benjamin Button susijęs su Hugo kaip filmas apie vaikus, nes tai tik maža istorijos dalis, apimanti daug didesnę trajektoriją.<br/><br/>Taigi, ar aš jus įtikinau? Greičiausiai ne. Bet aš džiaugiuosi sužinojęs, kad Hugo nebuvo visiškai be žavesio jums. Filmo kūrėjo Méliès sekos yra tai, kas padėjo Hugo man - ir bent jau mes galime pasidalinti tam tikra kino meile.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Tasha: Ne, aš negaliu pasakyti, kad jūs mane įtikinote, daugiau nei aš jus įtikinau. Neįmanoma ginčytis su kuo nors į visceralinę meilę, ir tikrai turėtų būti neįmanoma kalbėti su kuo nors iš visceralinės meilės. Dažniausiai jūs leidote man pamatyti Hugo Scott-O-Vision, o tai yra įdomi patirtis; bent jau dabar aš esu šiek tiek įsitikinęs, kad mes kažkaip nesugebėjome pamatyti visiškai skirtingų filmų, kurie abu kažkaip turėjo tą patį vardą ir režisierių.<br/><br/>Žinoma, mes turėjome skirtingų patirčių, tačiau, mano nuomone, daugiausia dėmesio skyrėme skirtingiems gamybos aspektams: aš vis dar nematau "filmas yra nuostabus" tema kaip viena filmo kryptis, tiek daug, kiek vienas iš per daug. "Beprasmiškai diskursyvus" beveik apima jį, nors aš norėčiau mesti "dažnai be reikalo mielas ir brangus" ant jo. Nors jūs sutelkėte dėmesį į filmo skanų pyrago įdarą, manau, kad tas pyragas buvo padengtas kristalizuoto cukraus svaru, ir manau, kad tai daro skirtumą, neatsižvelgiant į pagrindinę filmo žinutę ar keletą siaubingų scenų. Taip pat žiūrėkite Benjamin Button, kurį aš ne tik iškėliau, kad jus apgaudinėtų - aš tikrai manau, kad jūs turite daugiau sentimentalių dryžių nei aš, kai kalbama apie vaikus kine, ypač kai jie naudojami kaip pažeidžiamumo ir nekaltumo simboliai, o ne kaip žmonių simboliai. Ei, žinote, koks filmas visiškai neturi mielų plačiaaakių mopetų, atnešančių viltį į cinišką pasaulį? G.I. Joe: Kobros kilimas. Galbūt aš eisiu žiūrėti tų "Blu-ray" priedų. Galėčiau naudoti sprogimo insuliną, kad kompensuotų Hugo saldumą. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | „Tikėjausi, kad mano dukra bus laisva nuo sunkių ir nerimą keliančių laikų“, – sakė Mee Mee.<br/><br/>Viltis krizės metu: motinos dienos istorija<br/><br/>Parašė Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee išgirdo, kad kareiviai ateina. Ji paėmė savo sūnų ir pašėlusiai prisijungė prie likusių kaimo gyventojų, kurie bėgo link Tailando ir Birmos sienos, kur buvo įsikūręs Jungtinių Tautų vyriausiojo pabėgėlių reikalų komisaro biuras (UNHCR). Jos vyras buvo kitame kaime, važiuojančiame priešinga kryptimi, Mee vėliau sužinojo. Po to, kai kareivių persekiojimas baigėsi, Mee grįžo namo į savo mažą kaimą Koechi, Birma.<br/><br/>1997–2000 m. Mee ir tūkstančiai jos giminaičių gyveno nuolat grasindami smurtu iš Mianmaro kareivių pusės. Daugelis žmonių būtų imtis laikiną prieglobstį džiunglėse, ir grįžti namo į savo kaimą po to, kai kareiviai išvyko iš zonos, tiesiog padaryti viską vėl po kelių dienų. Maždaug kartą per savaitę Mee ir kiti būtų kelyje, kad būtų išvengta karių užgrobimo, išprievartavimo ar mirties.<br/><br/>Per vieną incidentą, Mee vyras bėgo prieš savo žmoną, kad užtikrintų maistą savo šeimai. Jos vyras buvo pastebėtas kareivių ir nušautas. Kulka sudaužė dalį jo šonkaulio, palikdama jį sunkiai sužeistą ir sielvartą, kai jis su savo šeima keliavo į džiungles dėl saugumo.<br/><br/>Tris mėnesius Mee vyras slėpėsi ir perkėlė šeimą su erzinančia žaizda jo pusėje. Jis negavo jokios medicininės priežiūros, išskyrus Mee priežiūrą.<br/><br/>"Aš bijojau grįžti į Birmą, - sakė Mee per vertėją. - Bijojau mirti. Aš verkiau ir verkiau kiekvieną dieną", - tęsė ji.<br/><br/>M.Mee vyras galų gale įgijo pakankamai jėgų, kad penkias dienas galėtų nueiti į nedidelį Tailando kaimą, kur jie sužinojo apie ligoninės ir pabėgėlių stovyklos vietą. Kai Mee ir jos vyras pagaliau atvyko į ligoninę, jam buvo nedelsiant atlikta operacija ir vėliau atsigavo.<br/><br/>Vilties simbolis<br/><br/>Gyvenimas džiunglėse tiems, kurie pabėgo iš Birmos kareivių, iš tikrųjų buvo baisus ir sunkus. Makeshift bambuko palapinės su tik stogo ir grindų dangomis tapo tinkamomis laikinomis buveinėmis. Daugelis moterų, įskaitant Mee, pagimdė vaikus džiunglėse. Mee tuomet šešerių metų sūnus padėjo pristatyti savo seserį Eh Ku Hser. Jos vardas reiškia meilę - šaltas - saldus. "Šaltas" Mianmaro kultūroje reiškia, kad nepraeis per gyvenimo ugnį, nes karštis reiškia neramius laikus.<br/><br/>„Tikėjausi, kad mano dukra bus laisva nuo sunkių ir nerimą keliančių laikų“, - sakė Mee. „Aš nenorėjau, kad ji išgyventų tai, ką patyriau“, - tęsė ji.<br/><br/>Mee, jos dukters gimimas tamsoje, kančios ir baimės viduryje, buvo vilties simbolis naujam gyvenimui.

Organizacija padeda pabėgėlėms moterims, kurios pabėgo nuo konfliktų zonų, atkurti savo gyvenimą per žvakių kūrimo meną. Moo Kho rekomendavo Mee prisijungti prie organizacijos, ir Mee mielai sutiko.<br/><br/>„Buvau sujaudinta, kad išeinu iš namų, – sakė Mee. – Buvau užauginta tikėti, kad dėl to, jog esu moteris, mano vaidmuo buvo likti namuose ir auginti savo šeimą.“ „Nors daugelis Mianmaro moterų nori daugiau nuveikti dėl savęs, jos dažnai skatinamos likti namų šeimininkėmis“, – pridūrė ji.<br/><br/>Šiandien Mee planuoja eiti į žvakių gamybos verslą sau ir remti savo penkis vaikus, tačiau ji išreiškė poreikį pirmiausia išmokti anglų kalbą.<br/><br/>„Tailando pabėgėlių stovykloje mes turėjome išsilavinimą, bet jis nebuvo toks geras, - sakė Mee. - Kai buvau vaikas, norėjau eiti į mokyklą, bet man buvo pasakyta likti namuose, nes buvau moteris.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Bradstreet questions her relationship with God while also creating herself, and fellow woman, a space equal to men.<br/>One of the best examples of her creating a position for women is the lines:<br/>"Let Greeks be Greeks, and women what they are/Men have precedency and still excel,/It is but vain unjustly to wage war;/Men can do best, and<br/><br/>1648 words - 7 pages<br/>In the Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes's theory of the state of nature serves as an exemplum; an account that legitimizes and argues for the authority of the state, by providing the logic behind sovereignty.

At the end of the prologue Bradstreet writes, "Let Greeks be Greeks, and woman what they are; Men have precedency and still excel, It is but vain unjustly to wage war; Men can do best, and women know it well."<br/>Bradstreet's tone seems to be sincere, but a hint of humor and sarcasm also lurks between the verses. This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Precedento esė<br/><br/>1562 žodžiai - 7 puslapiai<br/><br/>Teigiami veiksmai yra vyriausybės politika, kuri suteikia galimybes mažumoms, moterims ir bet kuriai grupei, kuri praeityje patyrė diskriminaciją. Teigiamas veiksmas yra 1960 m. Pilietinių teisių judėjimo, kilusio iš 1964 m. Pilietinių teisių akto, kuris uždraudė diskriminaciją dėl rasės, etninės kilmės ar lyties, rezultatas. Tai buvo 1978 m. Aukščiausiojo Teismo sprendimas, Kalifornijos universiteto Regents v. Bakke, kuris leido naudoti rasinius pageidavimus kaip įvairovės skatinimo priemonę, leidžiančią teigiamus veiksmus naudoti priėmimo politikoje. Ji buvo sukurta siekiant suteikti lygias galimybes mažumų grupių nariams švietimo ir ...<br/><br/>Tačiau, remiantis 2007 m. „Pew Research Center“ ataskaita, pastaraisiais metais Amerikos visuomenės parama teigiamiems veiksmams iš esmės išaugo nuo 58% 1995 m. Iki 70% 2007 m. Teigiamo veiksmo rėmėjai pateikia daug argumentų, kuriais remiami teigiami veiksmai, tikėdamiesi, kad kiti pamatys tikrąjį gėrį, kurį mūsų visuomenei duoda teigiama veiksmų politika. Rėmėjai mano, kad teigiami veiksmai yra labiau procesas, o ne priėmimo politika. Kolegijos ir universitetai imasi papildomos iniciatyvos, kad pasiektų mažumų grupes, skatindami juos kreiptis. Kolegijos ir universitetai siūlo papildomą finansinę pagalbą ir teikia universiteto išteklius, kad padėtų geriau studento koledžo išsilavinimą. Rėmėjai taip pat atkreipia dėmesį į didėjantį mažumų paraiškų kolegijoms ir universitetams skaičių, iš dalies dėl teigiamos veiksmų politikos.<br/>Statistika įrodė, kad, kai teigiamas veiksmas yra eliminuojamas, pavyzdžiui, kai jis buvo Berkley koledže ir UCLA 1998, mažumų studentų priėmimo sumažėjo 61 proc ir 36 proc., Įrodant, kad teigiamas veiksmas vaidina svarbų vaidmenį mažumų studentų koledžo priėmimo procese. Teigiami veiksmai rėmėjai taip pat mano, kad įvairovė aukštojo mokslo suteikia geresnę švietimo atmosferą visiems studentams, asmeniškai ir intelektualiai. Jei teigiamas veiksmas būtų pašalintas, kolegijose būtų mažiau mažumų studentų, todėl įvairovė būtų gana plona. Teigiama veiksmų politika taip pat reikalinga siekiant kompensuoti šimtmečius rasinę, ekonominę ir socialinę priespaudą. Asmenys, turintys aukštesnį socialinį ir ekonominį statusą, turi daugiau galimybių nei tie, kurių socialinė ir ekonominė padėtis yra žemesnė. Rėmėjai mano, kad tam tikros rasinės ar etninės grupės yra nepalankioje padėtyje, nes jos dažnai gyvena mažesnes pajamas gaunančiuose namų ūkiuose ir todėl neturi tokių pačių išteklių kaip aukštesnių socialinių ir ekonominių klasių studentai. Advokatai palaiko studentų konkurencijos, pagrįstos nuopelnais, sąvoką, tačiau teigia, kad teigiami veiksmai kompensuoja ekonominius skirtumus. Kolegijos absolventai, kurie pasinaudojo teigiamais veiksmais, taip pat teigė, kad jie gavo geresnį darbą, uždirbo daugiau pinigų ir apskritai gyveno geriau dėl laimingų galimybių, kurias jie gavo teigiamais veiksmais.<br/>Teigiamo veiksmo rėmėjai nuolat pabrėžia didelę teigiamo veiksmo svarbą, atsižvelgiant į jo indėlį į kolegijos patirties ir apskritai visuomenės stiprinimą. Tačiau teigiamų veiksmų oponentai mano, kad atėjo laikas nutraukti teigiamus veiksmus. Oponentai mano, kad teigiami veiksmai buvo sukurti siekiant užtikrinti sąžiningą priėmimo praktiką, kad būtų galima pakeisti ilgą rasinės diskriminacijos laikotarpį. Jie mano, kad politika yra pasenusi.

| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Gimtadieniai<br/><br/>Kai kurie jūsų organizacijos žmonės gali nenorėti nurodyti savo gimimo datos. Infoodle leidžia pašalinti asmens gimimo metus! Norėdami tai padaryti:<br/><br/>Kai pridedate asmenį, spustelėkite mygtuką Slėpti metus, kad pašalintumėte asmens gimimo metus.<br/><br/>Taip pat, redaguodami asmenį, suraskite svetainės gimimo datos lauką. Spustelėkite mygtuką Redaguoti, tada spustelėkite Slėpti metus ir įrašyti.<br/><br/>Lengva kaip tai!<br/><br/>Pastaba: asmuo, kurio gimimo metai pašalinti, nebus rodomi jokiose ataskaitose, susijusiose su amžiaus kriterijais, ir yra klasifikuojamas kaip suaugęs, nes jų gimimo data iš tikrųjų yra nustatyta 1902 m.! Gimimo datos laukas paprastai yra informacijos skyriuje, tačiau jūsų administratorius galėjo perkelti jį į kitą skirtuką. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Deriniai<br/><br/>Kombinacijos yra gynyba nuo perforavimo, choreografiniai atsakymai į įvairių tipų išpuolius. Jie turi daug pavadinimų kovos menų srityje, bet (mano patirtimi) kiekvienas menas turi jų versiją. Tai daro juos skiriasi nuo formų, nes yra daug kovos menų, kurie neturi formų. Kas daro ten partnerių pratimai toks universalus? Kodėl reikia praktikuoti konkretų atsaką, kai (iš tikrųjų) laikas, atakos tipas, užpuoliko dydis ir šimtas kitų veiksnių tai padarys, todėl niekada nenaudosite viso choreografinio atsako? Ir galiausiai, kaip mes galime praktikuoti realią gynybinę situaciją ir išvengti žalos tuo pačiu metu?<br/><br/>Kombinacijų universalumas yra įspūdingas, švelniai tariant. Mūsų Kenpo karatė stilius turi 108 combo, kuriuos galima išmokti, sąrašą. (Dauguma studentų mokosi tik 20-30 nors) Brazilijos Jiu-Jitsu praleisti visą klases praktikuojančių rankų barai ir droseliai, mokymosi kiekvieną subtilumą judėti, o jūsų partneris siūlo mažai jokio pasipriešinimo. Kiekvienas boksininkas praleido valandas priešais maišą ir (arba) veidrodį, mėtydamas tą patį smūgių derinį, kol jų kūnas judėjo vien tik refleksu. Kombinacijos yra universalios, nes mes neturime geresnio būdo įvesti judėjimą ir tada praktikuoti subtilias pozicijas, reikalingas, kad jie veiktų. Paspaudus mažą slėgio tašką per drabužius, užtrunka daug praktikos, norint sugauti rankos strypą su valdymu, reikia kruopščiai pastatyti klubą ir paslėptą sąranką, o puikus derinys yra naudingas tik tuo atveju, jei galite per jį pereiti iš subalansuotos ir apsaugotos padėties. Ar galite rasti geresnį būdą, kaip įgyti šiuos įgūdžius?<br/><br/>Yra keletas veiksnių, lemiančių, kaip jūs reaguojate į išpuolį, ir nesvarbu, ar tai yra kova, ar kova, aš niekada nenaudojau viso derinio savo gynyboje. Kodėl tada mes praleidžiame valandas juos praktikuodami? Mes praktikuojame šiuos choreografinius atsakymus, nes tikslas yra ne ištraukti kombinaciją 8 kiekvieną kartą, kai matote kablys, bet parodyti jums vieną būdą, kaip jį blokuoti, ir tada galimas būdas jį sekti. Aš niekada pasirinko naudoti derinys 3 realybės situacijoje, bet blokas yra vienas iš mano go-to juda. Deriniai pridėti įrankius į įrankių dėžutę jie neturi nustatyti automobilį.<br/><br/>Paskutinis klausimas yra saugos klausimas. Jei mes praktikuoti realybės labui mes turime atkartoti realybę. Kaip mes išvengti žalos, o tai padaryti? Kai jis ateina į jį, tai apie pasitikėjimo kūrimo. Mes pradedame lėtai ir išmokti pasitikėti, kad mes turime kontroliuoti save. Mes mokomės pasitikėti mūsų partneriai turi kontrolę, taip pat. Daugiau laiko mes išmokti pasitikėti mūsų kontrolę mūsų partneris ir (šiek tiek baisiau) mes mokomės pasitikėti mūsų partneris kontrolę mums. Galų gale (su daug praktikos) galite judėti visu greičiu, mesti savo partnerį, ir yra išmestas be baimės traumos.<br/><br/>Deriniai yra universalūs dėl priežasties; jie praktikuojami taip, kad juos būtų galima suskirstyti į jų dalis, ir mes esame saugūs, pradėdami lėtai ir kurdami pasitikėjimą. Kaip ir visa kita kovos menų, deriniai turi daug priežasčių už savo praktiką ir vykdymą. |
