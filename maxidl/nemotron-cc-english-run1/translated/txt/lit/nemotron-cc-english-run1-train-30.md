Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Rašyti navigaciją<br/><br/>„Life Without Papers“ laimėjo geriausio rašytojo apdovanojimą<br/><br/>Leno Granto sukurtame tinklaraščio projekte „Gyvenimas be dokumentų“ (angl. „Life Without Papers“) pasakojama apie dokumentų neturinčias migrantų šeimas ir jaunimą. Dokumentų neturintys migrantai neturi nieko. Jiems neleidžiama dirbti. Jie neturi teisės nei į valstybės išmokas, nei į gyvenamąją vietą. Jie yra nematoma ir potencialiai labiausiai pažeidžiama grupė Jungtinėje Karalystėje šiandien.<br/><br/>Dokumentų neturintys migrantai (arba neteisėti migrantai) yra tie, kurie buvo parduoti sekso prekybai arba dėl vidaus vergovės; tai yra užsibuvę asmenys; tie, kurių prašymai suteikti prieglobstį buvo atmesti, ir kiti, kurie patyrė nesėkmę imigracijos sistemoje. Iš pradžių jie galėjo atvykti į Jungtinę Karalystę legaliai.<br/><br/>„Nelegalūs imigrantai“ – tie, kurie įsivaizdavo įvažiuojantys į šalį sunkvežimiais – sudaro nedidelę dalį dokumentų neturinčių asmenų.<br/><br/>Iš tiesų, kai kurie šaltiniai rodo, kad pusė iš maždaug 120 000 dokumentų neturinčių vaikų Jungtinėje Karalystėje iš tikrųjų čia gimė su dokumentų neturinčiais tėvais. Šie vaikai nuo gimimo yra nepalankioje padėtyje, tik dėl jų imigracijos statuso.<br/><br/>Dienoraštis pasakoja apie nedokumentuotus istorijas. Tai pabrėžia jų kasdienes kovas ir pažeidžiamumą, bet ir jų jėgą bei atsparumą. Tai nėra lengva skaityti.<br/><br/>Jūs galite prieiti prie dienoraščio per mūsų svetainę (dešiniojo stulpelio apačioje pagrindiniame puslapyje).<br/><br/>Dienoraštis laimėjo internetinę „Speaking Together“ žiniasklaidos apdovanojimų kategoriją.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabato mokyklos pamoka<br/><br/>Galatams Paulius nagrinėja tokius klausimus kaip laisvė, įstatymo vaidmuo išgelbėjime, mūsų padėtis Kristuje ir Dvasios vadovaujamo gyvenimo prigimtis, taip pat senas klausimas: Kaip nuodėmingi žmonės gali būti išteisinti prieš šventą ir teisingą Dievą?<br/><br/>Daugelis mokslininkų mano, kad galatai gali būti ankstyviausias Pauliaus laiškas. Jis buvo parašytas 49 m. po Kristaus, netrukus po garsiosios Jeruzalės tarybos (Apd 15). Todėl knyga gali būti seniausias žinomas krikščioniškas dokumentas. Apaštalų darbuose ir Galatams aiškiai pasakyta, kad ankstyvoji bažnyčia įsitraukė į aršią kovą dėl išgelbėjimo prigimties, ypač pagonių atveju. Pasak žydų tikinčiųjų grupės, žinomos kaip judaistai, tikėjimas Jėzumi nebuvo pakankamai geras pagonims. Pagonys taip pat turi būti apipjaustyti ir laikytis Mozės įstatymų (Apaštalų darbų 15:1).<br/><br/>Šio ketvirčio Biblijos studijų vadovas kviečia mus keliauti su apaštalu Pauliumi, kaip jis prašo su galatais likti ištikimi Jėzui. Tai taip pat suteikia mums galimybę apmąstyti mūsų pačių supratimą apie tiesas, kurios atvėrė kelią Martino Liuterio galutiniam pertraukimui su Roma ir biblinės Evangelijos atkūrimui. |

Frederikas Frederikas Karlas Liudvikas Georgas Heinrichas, Frederikas Vilhelmas Karlas Josephas Liudvikas Georgas. Frederikas buvo laikomas populiarus ir protingas, jo karaliavimo metu kartu su savo gražia žmona Šarlotė, kultūrinis gyvenimas mažame miestelyje pasiekė savo zenitą. Tiek daug poetų ir menininkų ten praleido savo laiką, kad Hildburghauzenas buvo pramintas Klein-Weimaru, kai 1825 m. Be leidimo mirė paskutinis Saksonijos-Gotos-Altenburgo kunigaikštis, kitos namų šakos nusprendė pertvarkyti Ernestino kunigaikštystes. 1826 m. lapkričio 12 d. Frederikas tapo Saksonijos-Altenburgo hercogu, kuriam 1831 m. davė pirmąjį pagrindinį įstatymą mainais į žiniasklaidą, susijusią su Frederiku, Saksonijos-Altenburgo hercogu.<br/><br/>Frederikas, Saksonijos-Altenburgo hercogas<br/>–<br/>Frederikas<br/><br/>15 straipsnis<br/>Meklenburgo-Strelico kunigaikštienė Šarlotė Georgina<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine gimė Hanoveryje, Brunsviko-Liuneburgo rinkėjų. Ji buvo vyriausias Karolio II, Meklenburgo didžiojo kunigaikščio, vaikas ir dukra, Šarlotė ir jos seserys, Prūsijos karalienė Louise, Hanoverio karalienė Frederica ir Thurn und Taxis princesė Therese, buvo laikomos gražiausiomis savo laiko moterimis. Jeanas Paulas Friedrichas Richteris savo romaną „Titanas“ dedikavo keturiems gražiems, Charlotte užaugo Hanoveryje, kur jos tėvas tarnavo gubernatoriumi savo brolio, Jungtinės Karalystės karaliaus Jurgio III, kuris gyveno Londone, vardu. Kai Šarlotei buvo dvylika metų, jos motina mirė, o ją augino jos motinos sesuo Šarlotė, kuri 1784 m. Ištekėjo už tėvo, o jos seseris atvedė jos močiutė Maria Louise Albertine iš Leiningeno-Falkenburgo-Dagsburgo Darmštate. 1785 m. rugsėjo 3 d., būdama penkiolikos, Šarlotė ištekėjo už Saksonijos-Altenburgo kunigaikščio Frederiko, santuoka nebuvo laiminga, Šarlotė buvo protiškai pranašesnė už Frederiką, kuris pradėjo ją ignoruoti. Jie taip pat turėjo problemų, Saksonija-Hildburghauzenas buvo finansiškai sužlugdytas pražūtingos Fredericks pirmtakų politikos. Gavėjai leido hercogui ir kunigaikštienei tik sutrumpintą Civilinį sąrašą, Šarlotės tėvas ir du broliai dažnai pasiliko su Šarlote Hildburghauzene. 1787 m. Ji persikėlė į Hildburghauzeną visam laikui ir tapo kreditų komiteto prezidentu. 1792 m. Šarlotės senelė ir jos seserys pabėgo iš Darmštato į Hildburghauzeną, o jos močiutė pastebėjo Šarlotės vyrą. Iš visų savo pareigų jis uoliai vykdo savo santuokines pareigas. Šarlotė, kuri niekada nemylėjo šio vyro, visada yra nėščia, šeima praleido keletą nerūpestingų savaičių Hildburghauzene. 1793 m. Šarlotės močiutė grįžo iš tremties ir kartu su seserimis keliavo į Frankfurtą prie Maino, Šarlotė turėjo labai artimus ir mylinčius santykius su savo seserimi Friederike ir giminaičiais Strelitze. 1803 ir 1805 m. Prūsijos karališkoji pora aplankė Hildburghauzeną, nes šia proga gavėjai leido hercogų porai atnaujinti kai kuriuos savo baldus. Luiza padėjo parengti karo paskelbimą, krikščionių Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg buvo kunigaikščių poros draugas ir Šarlotės sūnaus Edvardo krikštatėvis. Daugelis žiūrovų atėjo pamatyti Bavarijos karūnos princesę, kai priėmė savo svečius, Truchseß bandė pirmiausia vesti žemesnio rango Charlotte į savo pilį, tačiau ji atsisakė, nurodydama savo dukterį. Truchseß atsakė: Jūsų Didenybė atleis man, bet tol, kol ši pilis stovėjo čia, Therese tada griebė baronai kitą ranką, ir trys iš jų vaikščiojo per vartus kartu.

Gimęs su giminaičiais Danijos teisme, jis didžiąją savo gyvenimo dalį praleido Danijoje, o jo motina buvo Didžiosios Britanijos karaliaus Jurgio II ir Ansbacho Karolinos dukra ir Danijos karalienės Louise sesuo. Jo tėvas, būsimas kapas, paliko šeimą 1747 m., 1755 m. Jis oficialiai nutraukė santuoką su Marija. Senelis Viljamas VIII, Heseno grafas, suteikė Hanau grafystę ir jos pajamas Marijai, jaunajam princui Charlesui ir jo dviem broliams, Williamui ir Frederikui, jų motinai ir nuo 1747 m. Protestantų giminaičiams. 1756 m. Marija persikėlė į Daniją, kad rūpintųsi savo sesers, Danijos karalienės Louise, nepilnamečiais vaikais. Kartu su ja ji paėmė savo sūnus, kurie buvo auginami Christiansborg rūmuose Kopenhagoje. Vėliau Heseno kunigaikščiai liko Danijoje, tapdami svarbiais jos valdovais, tik vyriausias brolis Viljamas grįžo į Heseną 1785 m., kai pakilo į sausumos graviaciją. Karolis pradėjo karjerą Danijoje. 1758 m. jis buvo paskirtas pulkininku, sulaukęs 20 m. generolo, taip pat 1766 m. jis buvo paskirtas Norvegijos generaliniu gubernatoriumi, pareigas ėjo iki 1768 m., Tačiau jos išliko daugiausia titulu, nes per šį laikotarpį jis niekada nebuvo išvykęs į Norvegiją. 1763 m. jo vyresnysis brolis Williamas vedė savo pirmąjį pusbrolį, Charlesas sekė 1766 m. Rugpjūčio 30 d. Christiansborg rūmuose - jo žmona buvo Danijos Louise, todėl Charlesas tapo savo pusbroliu, karaliumi Christian VII. Santuoka įvyko nepaisant prieš ją duotų patarimų dėl princo Charleso kaltinimų ištvirkavimu. Netrukus po to Charlesas pateko į teismą, o 1767 m. Pradžioje jis ir jie turėjo savo pirmąjį vaiką, Marie Sophie, 1767 m. Ir tada jų antrasis vaikas, Williamas, 1769 m. 1768 m. Karolis iš Edelsheimų šeimos įsigijo Ofenbacho-Rumpenheimo dvarą ir kaimą, 1771 m. dvarą išplėtė į pilį ir sostą, o jo motina Marija gyveno rūmuose iki savo mirties 1772 m. 1781 m. Čarlzas pardavė Rumpenheimo rūmus savo jaunesniajam broliui, Charles su šeima apsigyveno Gottorpo pilyje Šlėzvige. 1770 m. karalius Kristijonas VII davė savo seseriai Tegelhofo dvarą Gibyje tarp Šlėzvigo miesto ir Ekernfördės. Nuo 1772 m. Iki 1776 m. Charlesas turėjo vasaros rezidenciją, pastatytą vietoje, kurią jis pavadino Louisenlund savo žmonos garbei, 1772 m. Rugsėjo mėn. Charlesas buvo paskirtas Norvegijos kariuomenės vyriausiuoju vadu, o jis ir Louise persikėlė į Christianą. 1772 m. rugpjūčio 19 d. Švedijos karalius Gustavas III įvykdė valstybės perversmą, o 1773 m.

Jis laikomas „Casa dEste“ įkūrėju, vadovavęs pirmajai šeimai, kuri buvo Este meistras, Alberto Azzo II buvo vienintelis Alberto Azzo I sūnus, Milano Margrave. Apie 1020 m. jis paveldėjo savo tėvo kabinetus ir nuolat didino savo turtą šiaurinėje Italijoje, 1069–1070 m. jis bandė įsigyti Maine savo sūnui Hugh, nes jo žmona Garsende buvo ankstesnių Maine grafų bendrapaveldėtoja. Hughas buvo paskelbtas grafu, tačiau jis negalėjo nugalėti Roberto, Normandijos kunigaikščio, investicijų ginče tarp Šventosios Romos imperatoriaus Henriko IV ir popiežiaus Grigaliaus VII, Azzo bandė tarpininkauti, bet vėliau jis prisijungė prie popiežiaus pusės. Apie 1073 m. Jis padarė pilį Este savo rezidencijoje, iš kurios Este namas, prieš jo statybos projektą, Este buvo šiek tiek daugiau nei kaimas. Jo sūnus Welf pirmiausia persikėlė į Karintiją, o vėliau į Bavariją, sukurdamas vieną iš svarbiausių šeimų Europos istorijoje, kitas sūnus, Fulkas I Milanietis, pirmą kartą dokumentais panaudojo pavadinimą Marquis dEste. Azzo II vedė Kunigndę, Welfo II dukterį, Altdorfo grafą, ir jie turėjo vieną žinomą vaiką, Bavarijos kunigaikštį Welfą nuo 1070 iki 1077 ir nuo 1096 iki jo mirties, kuris buvo pirmasis Este namų Welf filialo narys. Antroji jo santuoka buvo su Meino grafo Herberto I dukra Garsende, ir jie turėjo šiuos žinomus sūnus: Fulco I, Milano Margrave, Meino grafo Este Hugh V Italijos filialo protėvis. Kai kurie šaltiniai teigia, kad jis taip pat vedė Vitalia Orseolo, Petro Orseolo dukterį, ir turėjo nesantuokinį romaną su Matilda, Padujos vyskupo Williamo seserimi, su kuria jis turėjo dukterį Adelasia, kuri vedė Guglielmo Adelardi.

Velfas buvo Azzo II iš Estės ir jo žmonos Kunigindės iš Altdorfo sūnus, kai Velfo motinos dėdė, Velfas, Karintijos kunigaikštis, mirė bevaikis, Velfas paveldėjo jo turtą. Velfas vedė Norteimo Etelindą, Bavarijos kunigaikščio Oto II dukterį, kai jo žentas Otas tapo karaliaus Henriko IV priešu ir neteko savo kunigaikštystės, jis liko ištikimas karaliui. Vykdydamas Henriko įsakymus, jis išsižadėjo ir išsiskyrė su savo kunigaikštiene Etelinde, ir šis įvykis įvyko Goslare 1070 m., kai Bavarijos žemės tyliai pakluso naujai sukurtam kunigaikščiui, kuris buvo vienos iš seniausių provincijos šeimų atstovas. Jo išsižadėjimas kunigaikštienės, kuri galėjo būti laikoma neteisybės aktu. Popiežius ir imperatorius buvo paviršutiniškai sutaikyti 1076 m., Tačiau tais metais jie vėl dalyvavo aktyviuose karo veiksmuose. Henris, dėl pakartotinių maišto aktų, paskelbė Welfą nuverstą savo naujai įsigytoje kunigaikštystėje. Tačiau, remiamas savo ištikimų bavarų ir padedamas savo tėvo Italijoje, Welfas sugebėjo išlaikyti savo vietą, tačiau 1085 m. Grigalius mirė, o jo įpėdiniai mažiau aktyviai dalyvavo Vokietijos reikaluose. Velfas, nors ir vis dar prisijungęs prie bažnyčios partijos, po skyrybų, 1070 m., Iš pirmosios žmonos, Welf vedė Juditą iš Flandrijos, Flandrijos grafo Baldwino IV dukterį ir Tostigo Godwinsono našlę, Nortumbrijos grafą. 1089 m. Welfo sūnus Welfas vedė Toskanos Matildą, taip sustiprindamas santykius su popiežiumi, tačiau po to, kai 1095 m. Jaunesnysis Welfas išsiskyrė su Matilda, Welfas pakeitė karaliaus Henriko IV poziciją ir buvo patvirtintas Bavarijos kunigaikščiu. Po tėvo Azzo mirties 1097 m. Welfas bandė įsigyti savo tėvo nuosavybę į pietus nuo Alpių, 1099 m. Welfas prisijungė prie vadinamojo 1101 m. Kryžiaus žygio, kartu su Viljamu IX iš Akvitanijos, Hugu iš Vermandu ir Ida iš Austrijos. Jo pagrindinis pasiekimas buvo užkirsti kelią susidūrimui tarp kryžiuočių, kurie plėšė Bizantijos teritoriją pakeliui į Konstantinopolį, pats Welfas išvengė fiasko, bet mirė pakeliui atgal į Pafosą, Kiprą, 1101 m. ir buvo palaidotas Weingarten vienuolyne.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Sekite mus<br/><br/>AR JŪS ESATE<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Alkanas cukrus? Štai ką jūsų kūnas bando jums pasakyti<br/><br/>pagal<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>NUOTRAUKA:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Svorio padidėjimas nuo nekontroliuojamų potraukį išskyrus, tai gali būti varginantis turėti nuolatinį troškimas kažko nesveiko ir nežinau, kodėl. Geros naujienos yra tai, kad paprastai yra priežastis, dėl kurios dega noras pastatyti bulvių traškučių maišelį, arba jausmas, kad jūs iš tikrųjų galite mirti, jei jūs negaunate marinuoti šiuo metu (net jei nesate nėščia). Pavyzdžiui, jei turite Paukščių Tako batonėlių vizijas, tai gali reikšti, kad jūsų mityboje trūksta labai specifinės maistinės medžiagos. (Yup - tai sudėtingesnė nei sakė šokolado batonėlis, kuris yra labai skanus.)<br/><br/>Mes kalbėjomės su Los Andželo dietologu Shira Lenchewski, MS, R.D., kad gautume liesą apie kai kuriuos įprastus maisto troškimus, taip pat tai, ką galite padaryti, kad numalšintumėte alkį, nesikreipdami per bortą. Nuolat slinkite, kad gautumėte rimtą gerą informaciją!<br/><br/>Jei norite šokolado<br/><br/>Tai reiškia, kad jūsų mityboje gali trūkti magnio, sako Lenchewski. „Magnis yra esminis mineralas, dalyvaujantis energijos gamyboje, gliukozės metabolizme ir raumenų funkcionavime. Tai ypač pasakytina apie tuos, kurie sunkiai nukentėjo sporto salėje“, - aiškina ji. Be to, magnio kiekis sumažėja per priešmenstruacines jūsų laikotarpio savaites, o tai paaiškina, kodėl PMS taip dažnai būna su šokolado potraukiu.<br/><br/>Vietoj to, siekti aukštos kokybės, mažai cukraus tamsaus šokolado, kuris yra natūraliai didelis magnio. "Aš rekomenduoju klijuoti iki 75 procentų kakavos ar daugiau, ir suporuoti jį su kitu magnio turtingu šaltiniu, pavyzdžiui, saulėgrąžų sėklomis", - sako Lenchewskis. Ji siūlo šokolado prekės ženklą Hu, mažų partijų maisto kompanija, kuri sutelkia dėmesį į aukštos kokybės ingredientus, pagamintus vietoje. "Tai šiek tiek brangus, bet tuo labiau, kad porcijos būtų patikrintos", - sako ji. "Tai mano asmeninis mėgstamiausias". Mes taip pat esame dideli supermaisto supakuotų Zenbunni gerbėjai.<br/><br/>Jei esate troškimas saldainiai<br/><br/>Tai reiškia: „Tyro cukraus troškimas yra geras ženklas, kad jūs mažai energijos, - sako Lenchewskis. - Pagalvokite apie tai. Koks yra vienas dalykas, kurį niežti po baisios nakties miego ar maždaug 16 val. per įtemptą darbo dieną? Atsakymas paprastai yra cukrus, nes jis naudojamas kaip momentinis kuras mūsų kūno ląstelėms.<br/><br/>Vietoj to, pasiekti obuolių su riešutų sviestu. "Jei jūs reiding savo bendradarbių saldainiai stash, aš rekomenduoju daugiau lėtai deginti angliavandenius su riebalų ar baltymų šaltinis," sako Lenchewski. "Skirtingai nuo paprasto cukraus, tai degins jūsų ląsteles, tuo pačiu išvengiant po cukraus avarijos. Du variantai, kad padaryti puikus pick-me-ups kitą kartą jūs trokštate saldainiai: griežinėliais obuolių su savo pasirinkimą riešutų sviesto, arba uogų su 2% nesaldinto graikiško jogurto. Mes taip pat mėgstame sutraiškyti saldų dantį su šiais priklausomybę sukeliančiais kokoso traškučiais - jie užpildo, be pridėto cukraus ir tiesiog taip gerai.<br/><br/>Jei esate alkanas druskos<br/><br/>Tai reiškia: "Jei nieko, bet sūriausias marinuoti bus padaryti, jums gali būti geriamojo pakankamai H2O, sako Lenchewski. "Druska padeda organizmui laikyti prie vandens, todėl mes trokštame jį, kai mums reikia skysčių."<br/><br/>Vietoj to, pasiekti vandens. "Likti hidratuotas, ypač kaip mes artėja vasaros mėnesiais," sako ji. Kitą kartą potraukį hitai, pabandykite numalšinti jį (pažodžiui) su keliais gaivus akinius ir jums gali rasti skubos natrio besaikis dingsta. "Jei paprastas vanduo jums nuobodu, pabandykite pridėti mėtų, citrinos ar šaldytų vaisių, kad sumaišytumėte", - sako Lenchewskis. Ir jei tai vis dar neveikia, yra sveikesnė alternatyva maišytiems traškučiams ar bulvytėms. "Jei jūs tikrai tik trokšta druskos, skrudintos jūros dumbliai yra puikus mažai kalorijų variantas", - sako ji.<br/><br/>Jei trokštate krakmolingų angliavandenių, pavyzdžiui, makaronų<br/><br/>Tai reiškia: "Kadangi maisto produktai, turintys daug angliavandenių, padidina geros savijautos hormono serotonino kiekį, krakmolo potraukis gali būti ženklas, kad jums reikia nuotaikos stiprintuvo", - sako Lenchewskis.<br/><br/>Vietoj to, pasiekti vonią! "Bush iš Epsom druskų, nes atėjo laikas kai kurių rimtų R + R, sako Lenchewski. "Pasitikėkite manimi. Malonumas krakmolo nemokamai visiems jaučiasi tikrai gerai šiuo metu, bet tai tikriausiai bus jums daugiau iš kitą dieną." (Kaip ir kiekvienas, kuris kada nors per daug valgė picą ar makaronų troškimą žino.) Taigi kitą kartą, kai norėsite pirmą kartą pasinerti į angliavandenių dubenį, paimkite vonią, uždegkite žvakę ir gydykite save be jokių apgailestavimų ar tankių kalorijų.<br/><br/>Jei trokštate ledų<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Tai reiškia: "Jūsų kūnas gali jums pasakyti, kad jam reikia šiek tiek sveikų riebalų".<br/><br/>Vietoj to, pasiekti kokoso ledų. "Aš esu realistas, todėl, jei jūs trokštate ledų, aš nesiruošia rekomenduoti graikinių riešutų sauja, kuri, žinoma, pilnas sveikų riebalų," sako Lenchewski. "Neatidėliotinoms situacijoms rekomenduoju mažesnio cukraus kokoso ledus, tokius kaip "Coconut Bliss" arba "Kippy" trijų ingredientų ledai Los Andžele." Mes galime garantuoti, kad kokoso ledai skonis neįtikėtinas ir kaip tikras dalykas.<br/><br/>Jei norite suvalgyti mėsainį<br/><br/>Tai reiškia: Jums reikia geležies. „Jei negalite nustoti galvoti apie raudoną mėsą, yra tikimybė, kad jūsų kūnas trokšta geležies, b12 ir folio rūgšties“, - sako Lenchewskis. „Tai ypač pasakytina apie tą mėnesio laiką.“<br/><br/>Vietoj to, ieškokite sveikesnio mėsainio. „Aš esu kartą per savaitę žolės, antibiotikų ir hormonų neturinčios raudonos mėsos šalininkas, - sako Lenchewskis. - Pabandykite eksperimentuoti su atviru bizonų mėsainiu, kuris, supjaustytas pjaustymui, yra plonesnis ir turi daugiau geležies nei jautiena.“ Nevalgykite mėsos? Pabandykite įtraukti tam tikrą augalinį geležies papildą į savo įprastą, pvz., Spiruliną. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Ji girdi laikrodį N-1 kartus, todėl ji žino, kad Bobas buvo pasakytas N+1. Todėl kitame dalyke ji gali teisingai atspėti slaptą Bobo numerį. Tačiau, jei susiduriame su mažais skaičiais, jis gali būti žaidžiamas kitaip. Jei Alisa buvo pasakyta 1, ji žino, kad Bobui buvo pasakyta 2, nes 0 nėra teigiamas (arba neigiamas) skaičius.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Interneto Paslaugos, Pardavėjai Ir Kibernetinių Įstatymų!<br/><br/>Atnaujinta:Balandis 21, 2014Bilalas Ahmadas<br/><br/>Kompiuterizacija šio pasaulio pasikeitė žmogaus veiklos scenarijų didžiąja dalimi ir kad per daug už matavimo. Pavyzdžiui, Dabar galite siųsti gyvybiškai svarbią informaciją visame pasaulyje su vienu pelės paspaudimu, dėka interneto ryšį. Deja, būtent šis platus ryšys ir populiarumas tarp žmonių, internetas taip pat padidino kompiuterinių nusikaltimų galimybes. Internetiniai nusikaltimai ar kompiuteriniai nusikaltimai yra plačiai žinomi kaip "kibernetiniai nusikaltimai".<br/><br/>"Kibernetiniai įstatymai" yra kažkas naujo teismų sistemoje, tačiau pastaruoju metu įgijo daug dėmesio. Sąvoka "kibernetiniai nusikaltimai" yra kažkas labai sinonimas su įprastiniais nusikaltimais, vienintelis skirtumas yra vidutinis vykdymas. Yra daugiausia dviejų rūšių kibernetinių nusikaltimų, pirmasis yra tas, kuriame kompiuteriai yra pagrindiniai taikiniai, ir tai apima duomenų sugadinimo atvejus, kenkėjišką kodą ir net prieigą prie nusikalstamų duomenų. Antrasis yra tai, kad kompiuteris yra tik įrankis, kuriuo naudojami įprasti nusikaltimai, pvz., Kibernetinis terorizmas, šlamštas, kibernetinis persekiojimas ir daug daugiau.<br/><br/>Tai kur svetainės konsultantas ar pardavėjas ateina į sceną. Nors nežinote apie visus iki šiol pateiktus kibernetinius įstatymus, svetainės pardavėjas gali patarti jums dėl kai kurių svarbiausių kibernetinių įstatymų, kai kuriate savo svetainę.<br/><br/>Tai gali apimti bendras žinias apie kopijavimo teises ar net savo svetainės turinio apsaugą. Paaiškinti jums visas teises, kurias turite kaip svetainės savininkas, taip pat yra viena iš užduočių, kurias svetainės pardavėjas gali atlikti kurdamas savo svetainę. Pardavėjas taip pat gali jums padėti, siūlydamas informaciją apie įvairius kibernetinius įstatymus, kad apsaugotų duomenis. Be to, pardavėjas taip pat gali pasiūlyti jums informaciją apie bet kokį naują kibernetinį įstatymą, apie kurį galbūt nežinote. Kibernetiniai įstatymai gali skirtis priklausomai nuo šalies, vienas iš naujausių pavyzdžių gali būti Jungtinėje Karalystėje išleistas slapukų įstatymas, kuris neleidžia svetainei išsaugoti jokių naudotojų naršymo duomenų. Pagal Slapukų įstatymą, svetainės Jungtinėje Karalystėje negali išsaugoti slapukų failų be informatyvaus naršytojo sutikimo.<br/><br/>Įgyvendinus tokį įstatymą, interneto svetainėse dabar yra iššokantis langas, kuriame prašoma lankytojo sutikimo išsaugoti slapukų failus. Tokie failai naudojami interneto svetainėse, kad būtų galima analizuoti lankytojų naršymo modelius, pagal kuriuos reklamos tada skelbiamos vartotojo lange. Kadangi įsilaužimas nebėra naujas dalykas mums visiems, ar manote, kad tokios taisyklės ir reglamentai gali užkirsti kelią internetiniam klastojimui ar elektroniniams nusikaltimams? Technologijos vystėsi sparčiai, tačiau vis dar žmonės nenori apsipirkti internetu, nes bijo, kad asmeninės ar banko sąskaitos duomenys bus nulaužti. Didėjant kibernetiniams nusikaltimams, taip pat padidėjo griežtų kibernetinių įstatymų poreikis, kad būtų galima pažaboti tą patį ir skatinti nerizikingą apsipirkimo patirtį.<br/><br/>Kibernetinių nusikaltimų rūšys<br/><br/>Per daugelį metų buvo trys pagrindinės kibernetinių nusikaltimų klasės:<br/><br/>Neteisėta prieiga prie kompiuterinės sistemos atvejais, kurie apima įsilaužimo ar vagystės vartotojo vardus ir slaptažodžius gauti prieigą per asmeninę informaciją atitinkamo vartotojo. Šios rūšies backdoor prieigos organizuojami su Trojos arklys pagalba. Kenkėjiškų programų, tokių kaip Trojos arklys, kirminai ar kompiuteriniai virusai ir kt., Išleidimas Paskutinė klasė apima kibernetinį vartotojo persekiojimą ar priekabiavimą internete .<br/><br/>Kibernetinių nusikaltimų pasekmės<br/><br/>Pardavimų sumažėjimas<br/><br/>Darbuotojų skaičiaus sumažėjimas dėl tinklo vėlavimo<br/><br/>Asmeninės informacijos, pvz., mokslinių tyrimų, praradimas<br/><br/>Komunikacijos proceso sutrikimas<br/><br/>Kibernetinių nusikaltimų netiesioginiai padariniai<br/><br/>Patikimumo klausimas mūsų finansų sistemoje<br/><br/>Prekės ženklo įvaizdis yra apgadintas rinkoje<br/><br/>Kibernetiniai nusikaltimai daro įtaką verslo santykiams rinkoje<br/><br/>Prarastas pasitikėjimas valstybės politika ir vyriausybinėmis agentūromis<br/><br/>Kibernetinių nusikaltimų prevencija<br/><br/>Kaip netizens yra tam tikrų atsargumo priemonių, kad mes turėtume apsvarstyti už saugią ir patikimą patirtį internete. Štai keletas iš jų:<br/><br/>Pirmas dalykas, kurį reikia padaryti, bus išlaikyti asmeninę informaciją sau ir išvengti dalijimosi tuo pačiu internete.<br/><br/>Venkite dalintis bet kokiomis nuotraukomis su interneto pokalbių draugais ar nepažįstamais žmonėmis.<br/><br/>Naujausios antivirusinės versijos įdiegimas jūsų sistemoje gali pasiūlyti jums gerą gynybos liniją nuo interneto grėsmių, tokių kaip virusai ir kenkėjiškos programos.<br/><br/>Jūsų vertingų duomenų atsarginė kopija yra geras pasirinkimas, kad būtų išvengta problemų, pvz., Viruso užteršimo.<br/><br/>Venkite siųsti kredito kortelės informaciją į svetaines, kurios yra nesaugios ir neturi jokio galiojančio sertifikato.<br/><br/>Įdiekite saugos programą, kuri siūlo jums kontroliuoti svetainės slapukus ir taupo jus nuo stebėjimo svetainėse.<br/><br/>Priimančiosios įsibrovimo aptikimo įrenginių įdėjimas į serverius padės stebėti svetainės srauto pažeidimus.<br/><br/>Rekomenduojama naudoti ugniasienę.<br/><br/>Kodėl kibernetinės atakos tokios populiarios?<br/><br/>Pigiau nei tradiciniai sukčiavimo būdai<br/><br/>Susekti kibernetinius nusikaltimus nėra lengva<br/><br/>Tikslios vietos negali būti lengvai sekamos<br/><br/>Fizinio barjero nebuvimas interneto pasaulyje<br/><br/>Kibernetiniai nusikaltimai palietė daugybę žmonių<br/><br/>Išvada<br/><br/>Faktas, kad žmogaus protas turi neišmatuojamą galią, yra neginčijamas, todėl nusikaltimai internete auga milžinišku greičiu. Net istorija liudija, kad kai kurie iš didžiausių interneto saugumo dingo kaput iki įsilaužėlių, kurie lengvai ištrūko per rankas. Vienintelis būdas pažaboti tokius nusikaltimus yra žinoti apie kibernetinius įstatymus, kuriuos turime šiandien, tai gali būti per internetą arba per svetainių / IT tiekėjus. Informacinių technologijų aktas turi būti subalansuotas taip, kad būtų pernelyg griežtas kibernetiniuose nusikaltimuose dalyvaujantiems žmonėms ir kartu niekada netrukdytų interneto pramonės augimui.<br/><br/>Autorius Bio:- Maneet Puri šiuo metu vadovauja kokybės interneto dizaino firmai, esančiai Naujajame Delyje, Indijoje.
