| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Kvidičas per amžius<br/><br/>Aš doodling kai kuriuos su Kvidičas susijusius objektus, pavyzdžiui, šluotų lazdelės ir snickers ir whatnot ir tai tarsi virto į šį keistą dalykų rinkinys, įskaitant Harry žemyn apačioje. Aš nesu visiškai patenkintas tuo, kaip jis pasirodė, bet kadangi tai nėra blogai mano antrajai Hario Poterio gerbėjų meno nuotraukai, aš nusprendžiau bet kuriuo atveju jį nuspalvinti. Jei jums įdomu, kur yra jo randas, jis ten, bet jis labai lengvas ir mažas, nes aš tai padariau šiek tiek kompiuteryje. Eskizas rašikliu, spalvotas dažais. |

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Jei jus priėmė ir įstojo -> taip Jei buvote priimtas ir lankė kitą mokyklą -> taip Jei jūs paėmėte pratęsimo kursus (ar jie net juos ten? Aš žinau, UCLA daro) -> taip Jei jūs nuvyko į aukštąją mokyklą ten -> taip<br/><br/>Tai yra mano interpretacija, nes bet kuris iš šių scenarijų atitiktų "priimtą bakalauro programą" arba "mokymąsi" UC Berkeley. Galiu klysti, bet geriau paskambink jiems ir paaiškink savo situaciją.<br/><br/>Mano nuomonė: Remiantis formuluote, aš ją interpretavau kaip klausimą, ar buvote priimtas į Berkeley undergradą, ar pasirinkote dalyvauti. Jei tai reiškė, pripažino ir dalyvavo, jie galėjo lengvai matyti, kad per "Undergrad institucijų" paraiškos dalis. |

| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Žiemos apsauga figmedžiams<br/><br/>Pranešti apie šį straipsnį<br/><br/>Žiemos apsauga figmedžiams<br/><br/>Apžvalga<br/><br/>Figų medis buvo maždaug nuo ne mažiau kaip 5000 BC, ir yra auginami visame pasaulyje dėl savo skanių vaisių. Figos gerai auga švelnaus klimato be ekstremalių oro sąlygų. Figų medis dabar dauginamos kai kuriose vietovėse su atšiaurių žiemų. Būtina imtis apsaugos priemonių, kad medis būtų apsaugotas nuo žiemos žalos.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Medžiai<br/><br/>Dekoratyviniai figų medžiai vazonuose gali stovėti šiek tiek užšalimo ir nereikalauja šviesos, kai jie patenka į žiemos ramybės fazę. Venkite ekstremalių temperatūros svyravimų, įdėdami figmedį į kontroliuojamą aplinką, pvz., Garažą, kur temperatūra svyruoja nuo šiek tiek užšalimo iki šiek tiek aukščiau. Augalą reikia laistyti, kai dirvožemis išdžiūsta.<br/><br/>Ekranavimas<br/><br/>Būtina apsaugoti medį nuo ekstremaliausių žiemos orų. Figų medžiai turi būti patalpinti dirvožemio vietose, kur dirvožemis neužšąla, kad apsaugotų jį nuo ligų ir padidintų žiemos išlikimo galimybes. Dideli ekranai aplink medį apsaugo jį nuo žiemos vėjų, kurie gali sugadinti ir užšaldyti medieną.<br/><br/>Apvyniojimas<br/><br/>Medžio įvyniojimas apsaugo medį nuo šalto oro ir neleidžia stipriems vėjams sunaikinti šakų. Figų medžio įvyniojimas turėtų būti taikomas, kai lapai iš medžio nukrito, kad lapai nebūtų puvinio viduje. Figų medžiai yra jautrūs nedideliems temperatūros pokyčiams. Jis negali sušilti apsauginės plėvelės viduje, kitaip medis gali pradėti augti, todėl jis yra jautrus sunkiai žalai šalto momento metu.<br/><br/>Sodinimas<br/><br/>Auginimo praktika padeda apsaugoti figų medį atšiauriomis žiemomis. Veislės, atsparios šaltam orui, geriausiai tinka vietoms, kuriose oras yra atšiaurus. Ruda Turkija, Brunsvikas ir mėlyna Celeste yra geros veislės šaltam orui. Sodinimas turėtų būti atliekamas prieš sieną ar konstrukciją, kuri žiemos mėnesiais spinduliuoja šilumą į medį.<br/><br/>Sniegas<br/><br/>Figų šaknys reikalauja sauso dirvožemio žiemos ramybės laikotarpiu. Laistymas turėtų būti atliekamas tik tada, kai dirvožemis yra sausas, o šaknys turėtų būti apsaugotos nuo tirpstančio sniego ir lietaus. Apsauga, dedama ant žemės po medžiu, šalia kamieno, kad vanduo nepatektų į dirvožemį, apsaugo medį nuo žalos.<br/><br/>Raktiniai žodžiai:<br/>figmedžio apsauga, figmedžio žiema, figmedžio priežiūra |
| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | "Oculus" generalinis direktorius "Mac" palaiko "Rift"<br/><br/>"Oculus" generalinis direktorius, Palmeris Luckey, nepakeitė savo žodžių, kai interviu paklausė, ar "Rift VR" ausinės kada nors palaikys "Mac". Jei turėjote kokių nors vilčių, kad tai bus netrukus, galbūt norėsite pasiruošti nusivylimui.<br/><br/>Tai priklauso nuo "Apple". Jei jie kada nors išleis gerą kompiuterį, mes tai padarysime.<br/><br/>Tai, ką jis kalba apie ten mažiau diplomatine prasme, yra atskira grafika, reikalinga paleisti "Rift". Paprasta tiesa yra ta, kad "Apple" tiesiog nesikreipia į aukštos klasės grafiką, kuri atitiks ausinių reikalavimus. Kontekstui "Windows" kompiuteryje jums reikia mažiausiai "NVIDIA GTX 970", 300 dolerių grafikos plokštės.<br/><br/>Kaip Luckey tęsė:<br/><br/>Tai tik veržiasi į tai, kad "Apple" neteikia pirmenybės aukščiausios klasės GPU. Galite įsigyti $ 6,000 "Mac Pro" su "AMD FirePro D700" linijos viršuje, ir tai vis dar neatitinka mūsų rekomenduojamų specifikacijų. Taigi, jei jie pirmenybę teiks aukštesnės klasės grafikos procesoriams, kaip tai darė anksčiau, mes mielai palaikytume Mac'ą, bet dabar ten tiesiog nėra nė vieno jį palaikančio įrenginio.<br/><br/>Negalima kaltinti, kad „Mac Pro“ neturi daug arklio galios, nes taip yra, tačiau „FirePro“ grafika yra labiau nukreipta į kūrybinę rinką, kaip ir „Mac Pro“. Visų pirma "Mac Pro" gerokai viršija kitus aparatūros reikalavimus, tačiau, žinoma, kadangi "Rift" yra sunki grafika, tai yra trūkumas. Luckey galbūt yra šiek tiek virš viršaus, bet lygiai taip pat jis yra žmogus už Rifto, todėl nėra jokių abejonių, kad tai, ką jis sako, yra daug tiesos. Net jei jis to nesako ypač gerai.<br/><br/>Ką jūs sakote, "Mac" pasaulio savininkai? Ar jūs netgi nerimaujate dėl "Oculus Rift" ar tai kažkas, ko norėtumėte turėti? Garsas žemiau pateiktuose komentaruose!<br/><br/>Skaitytojo komentarai<br/><br/>"Oculus" generalinis direktorius "Mac" palaiko "Rift"<br/><br/>Ne, tai nesivargino, nes aš tikrai neplanavau pirkti "Oculus Rift". Man produktų kategorija vis dar yra per anksti ir per daug beta-kinda fazėje. Bet jis pakyla galiojantį tašką. "Apple" turėtų pabandyti gauti daugiau į priekį nuo pakuotės CPU / GPU protingas. Šiuo metu jie visada atsilieka.<br/><br/>Atsiprašau, bet kas yra HTC Vive geriau? Ir Oculus Rift tikrai palaiko Linux mašinos, kurios atitinka jų aparatūros specifikacijas! (Šis klausimas yra ne OS, bet aparatūros.)<br/><br/>Taip pat pažiūrėkite, kodėl "HTC Vive" palaiko "OS X": ji apima daugiau savo aparatūros. (Štai kodėl tai kainuoja tiek daug.) "Oculus" sprendimai - tiek "Rift", tiek "Samsung Gear VR" - reikalauja aparatūros, kurią ji prijungia, kad atliktų daugiau sunkių kėlimo.<br/><br/>VR nėra gudrybė. 3D televizoriai ne visada suteikia tiek daug 3D efekto, ir tai neveikia su visais. VR dirba su visais, o "Oculus" ir "HTC Vive" oficialūs išleidimo produktai beveik neturi vėlavimo, todėl nėra jokio judėjimo ligos. Taip pat yra daug žaidimų palaikymo<br/><br/>Akivaizdu, kad jei lošimai yra prioritetas, jūs paprastai nesate "Mac" rinkoje. Ne daug žaidimų kūrėjų palaiko OSX, todėl šių tipų įrenginiai greičiausiai turi ribotą naudojimą "Mac" (žaidimams, bet kokiu atveju, kuriam "Rift" buvo sukurtas). Bent jau tai yra vienintelė priežastis, kodėl aš galėjau pamatyti save naudojant vieną. Aš tikrai ne naudoti jį žiūrėti filmus.<br/><br/>"Apple" įdiegė "Metal" variklį į "El Capitan", gali būti tam tikras planas eiti į žaidimų rinką (kaip "Apple" sužinojo iš "iOS", kaip ši rinka yra didelė, tiesiog pažvelkite į aukščiausias bruto programas).<br/>Taigi dabar trūksta aparatūros ir žaidimų kūrėjai tikriausiai parodytų tam tikrą susidomėjimą, nes "Mac" dabar yra priimtinas "Mac" vartotojų skaičius visame pasaulyje.<br/><br/>Norėčiau, kad „Apple“ įžengtų į šį pramonės sektorių. Šiuo metu nenaudoju jokių „Apple“ produktų, bet jie daro daug teisingų žingsnių daugelyje sričių, ir aš esu labai intriguojantis.<br/><br/>Be to, konkurencija skatina naujoves. Žinau, kad pagrindiniai kompiuterių dalių gamintojai jau sukuria tokią konkurenciją, tačiau "Apple" turi RND valios ir pinigų, kad iš tikrųjų pasuktų galvas. Jie negali laimėti skaičių žaidimų pagal specifikacijas, jie iš tikrųjų retai tai daro, tačiau dauguma žmonių, kuriems rūpi atlikti tyrimus, žino, kad našumas! = įrenginio dalių suma. "Apple" gali padaryti daugiau su "mažiau". Ant popieriaus jų produktai atrodo prastesni, tačiau kai kruopščiai subalansuota aparatinė įranga atitinka specialiai sukurtą programinę įrangą, jie paprastai veikia taip pat, kaip ir konkurencija, jei ne.<br/><br/>HA! Man patinka, kaip staiga, turintys aukštos kokybės kompiuterį nėra svarbu, kad "Apple" fanai! Nėra vieno "Mac", galinčio aukščiausios klasės grafika. Negali pirkti vieną, negali sukurti vieną. "Mac" negali būti didžiausias našumas, ir jūs gerai su tuo. HA! Klasikinis!<br/><br/>Aš nusipirkau savo "MacBook Pro Retina" 2012 m. Dėl didelės skiriamosios gebos ekrano ir nepastebimo GPU. Tačiau savo darbalaukyje sukūriau sistemą su 4K monitoriumi, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU ir 16 GB atminties, o tai yra mažiau nei tai, ką norėčiau mokėti už "iMac". Aš netgi turiu SSD, kuris bus paleistas OSX. Mano taškas yra tai, kad "Apple" galėtų daryti panašius dalykus, jei norėtų, bet ne. Tiesą sakant, pažvelkite į naujausią "iMac". Tai apima atskirą grafiką ir lėtą 5400 aps./min. Mano kompiuteris gali atrodyti ne taip gražiai, o ne taip plonas, bet galų gale tai yra naudingesnis - ar ne todėl mes pirmiausia perkame kompiuterį?<br/><br/>Aš nesuprantu, kodėl "Mac pro" negali naudoti "Oculus" nėra sukurtas vaizdo įrašams. Suprantu, kad jis negalės paleisti "iMac" ir dėl to "Oculus" turėtų būti firminis "Pro" vartotojams dėl reikalavimų ir kainos.<br/><br/>Dabar žmonės sako, kad jūsų kompiuteris daro VISUS sunkius kėlimus, taigi kodėl kainos taškas viršija 800 JAV dolerių už kažką, kas nieko nedaro?<br/><br/>Aš esu susijaudinęs apie VR kryptį, bet ne tai, kur ji yra šiuo metu.<br/><br/>Jūsų ekranas (kuris yra „Rift“) niekada nedaro jokio sunkaus kėlimo. Tai 800 JAV dolerių dėl to, ką daro ekranas; 110 ° žiūrėjimo kampas (vis dar ne žmogaus akis, bet daug arčiau nei kiti ekranai) su itin mažu latentiniu greičiu, kad būtų galima sumažinti arba pašalinti judesio ligą 1200x1800 viename akies ekrane, kad būtų užtikrinta HD kokybė.<br/><br/>Ir taip, "Mac" yra labai plačiai naudojami vaizdo generavimui, tačiau šis generavimas neįvyksta 30 + fps. Tai gali užtrukti vaizdo generavimo mašinų valandas, kad būtų sukurtas vienas kadras, o kartais ir metai, kad būtų sukurtas visas filmas. Galutiniai produktai arba iš anksto pateikta medžiaga yra tai, kas tampa 30 + fps.<br/><br/>Ačiū @TheRealFixxer<br/>Daug kas iš to, ką jūs sakote, yra prasminga, o kai kurie iš jų man buvo nežinomi.<br/><br/>Manau, kad nematau VR kaip žaidimo, bet kaip panardinimas ir "Mac" matymas yra geras "3dcad" ir kompiliuojant vaizdo įrašą, manau, kad jie galėtų gerai sudaryti sceną. Aš netgi mačiau 3d filmų atvaizdus. Sukurkite 3D pasaulį ir įdėkite fotoaparatus į sritis, kad išsiaiškintumėte, kaip atrodytų scena<br/><br/>Bet aš sutinku, kad "Mac" daugiau naudoja procesoriaus ciklus, net ir naudojant GPU. Su tuo, kad sakė, kad yra ir kitų krypčių, kurias galima paimti. Kaip ir išorinės "Thunderbolt" vaizdo plokštės.<br/><br/>Mano didelis sukibimas yra tai, kad "Octulas" yra vertinamas kaip vartojimo produktas. Jei reikalavimai yra tokie aukšti, tai yra daugiau pro produktas ir turi būti reklamuojamas kaip toks. Suprantu, kad technologija egzistuoja, bet nemanau, kad tai yra vartojimo produktas.<br/><br/>Taip, jūs teisus. "Apple" taip pat turi problemų su programine įranga. Dauguma nenaudoja "metalo" "Apple" programavimo kalbos, kuri pagreitina žaidimų apdorojimą, nes tai yra "Apple" tik sprendimas, kuriame daugelis naudoja žaidimų variklius, kurie dirba "Microsoft Direct X" arba atviro kodo "Opengl", kuriuos dauguma žaidimų naudoja "Linux" ir "oSX". "Opengl" yra apie 20% lėtesnis ir kartais daug daugiau, palyginti su tiesioginiu x, todėl "oSX" veikiančios linijos žaidimų kortelės viršuje veikia taip pat greitai, kaip ir vidutinio lygio žaidimų kortelė "Windows". Taigi didelės problemos, jau nekalbant apie tai, kad dauguma "Mac" sukūrė korteles, kurios neturi atnaujinimo galimybės.<br/><br/>"Mac pro" yra toks skirtingas, kad "Apple" turėtų tai padaryti, nes tai nebūtų verta kortelės tiekėjo, nes jiems nėra pelno su nedideliu galimų pirkėjų kiekiu. "Apple" nemėgsta prarasti pinigų, todėl aš nematau, kad tai kada nors atsitiks. "Apple" prarastų pinigus, siūlančius vaizdo plokštės atnaujinimus "Mac" profesionalams.<br/><br/>Na jis turi tašką, nors man rūpi "Oculus Rift", o laukti "starVR". Turėtų būti galimybė pridėti geresnių GPU į "iMac" ir "MacBook Pro". Taip pat liūdna, kad nebėra nVidia kortelės, man patiko CUDA palaikymas dabar turėsiu įsigyti kompiuterį ir įdiegti "Linux" savo CUDA projektams.<br/><br/>Žaidimų rinka auga, ir tai nebus ilgai, kol net "iPhone" turės daugiau GPU našumo nei "Mac". Sutinku, kad "Apple" turėtų pasiūlyti aukščiausios klasės "GPU" "Mac"<br/><br/>Aš labai nerimauja dėl to, kad "Mac" kompiuteriuose trūksta aukštos kokybės atskiros grafikos. Net ir "iMac" viršuje naudojamas pasenęs mobilusis GPU, kurio, žinoma, negalima atnaujinti. Jei noriu kurti programinę įrangą VR, "Apple" nepaliko man kito pasirinkimo, kaip tik pirkti ar statyti kompiuterį, kad jį paleistumėte. Kaip didelis "Apple" gerbėjas (taip, aš tai pripažįstu), tai mane gana liūdna.<br/><br/>BTW, VR yra ne kai artimųjų fadas. Jei bandėte jį žinote, ką turiu galvoje. VR ketina pakeisti žaidimų ir turinio kūrimą amžinai. Mano vienintelis rūpestis VR yra tai, kad yra per geras. Gali būti milijonai žmonių, kurie taps priklausomi nuo gyvenimo ir žaidimo virtualiuose pasauliuose. Pažiūrėkite, kiek žmonių tapo priklausomi nuo MMO, kurie grojo ant plokščio ekrano. Su VR jūs tikrai manote, kad esate žaidime.<br/><br/>Nesijaudinkite dėl nieko, aš esu gana įsitikinęs, kad "Apple" turės savo "Mac" ir "iOS" diegimą, kai technologija bus paruošta vartotojams, dabar tai daugiau hardcore vartotojams. Kaip visada obuolys, kaip ir laikas, jo buvimas tinkamu laiku, su tinkamu produktu. Tikėkite obuoliu.<br/><br/>Juokinga, kad daugelis žmonių žino, kuris vr yra geresnis, pagrįstas kaulų palaikymu. Manau, kad jūs, vaikinai, atlikote sunkius bandymus ir dabar esate vaikinas didelėje elektroninėje parduotuvėje, kuris geriausiai žino.<br/><br/>HTC sakė, kad tai atneš paramą osx, bet tai vis dar reikia pamatyti.<br/><br/>Aš suprantu, kad daugelis iš jūsų vaikinai yra įspaustas ten d**ks. Bet suprasti, kad "Apple" yra labiau orientuota į nešiojamuosius kompiuterius. Ir nešiojamieji kompiuteriai negali būti supakuoti su daugiau galios nei kompiuterio, dėl dydžio, šilumos, energijos suvartojimo ir tt<br/><br/>Jis teisus, nors jis įdėti jį į **** sąlygomis. Aš myliu savo Mac, bet Viešpats ji turi padidinti grafika. Ne tai, kad jis turi kainuoti daugiau, bet aš būčiau daugiau nei pasirengęs mokėti šiek tiek daugiau už geresnę grafikos plokštę arba bent jau turėti galimybę įdiegti savo. Tai tikrai per blogai, kad šis vaikinas turėjo padaryti savo pareiškimą skamba kaip jis tiesiog paprastas neišsilavinęs. |
| The Masjid in the American Landscape: Civic Rights<br/><br/>Twelfth graders examine and explain legal rights designed to protect religious liberty. They evaluate the extent to which the First Amendment protects religious practices. They research and describe current and past legal battles over religious zoning and buildings. They discuss whether restrictions should be placed on where religious buildings are built.<br/><br/>What Members Say<br/><br/>As an online high school teacher, LP has helped me tremendously with extra resources! I have been able to use additional supplemental materials from here and students are able to gain more knowledge and a different perspective. | Masjid in the American Landscape: Pilietinės teisės<br/><br/>Dvylikos klasių moksleiviai nagrinėja ir aiškina teises, skirtas apsaugoti religijos laisvę. Jie vertina, kiek Pirmoji pataisa saugo religines praktikas. Jie tiria ir apibūdina dabartinius ir ankstesnius teisinius mūšius dėl religinių zonų ir pastatų. Jie aptaria, ar reikėtų nustatyti apribojimus religinių pastatų statyboms.<br/><br/>Ką sako nariai<br/><br/>Kaip internetinis vidurinės mokyklos mokytojas, LP man labai padėjo su papildomais ištekliais! Aš galėjau naudoti papildomą medžiagą iš čia ir studentai gali įgyti daugiau žinių ir kitokios perspektyvos. |
| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | Ką sako žmonės 19<br/><br/>Ne, taip yra todėl, kad pramogų gamintojai ir produktų rinkodaros specialistai nori aktorių / aktorių ir modelių, kurie atrodo kaip dauguma auditorijos, kad jie būtų susiję ir todėl efektyvesni pardavimo įrankiai. Aš tikiu, kad Azijos moterys puikiai atrodo Azijos vyrams. Man, kaip baltas žmogus, jie neturi jokio apeliacinio skundo.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Aš esu 100 procentų tiesiai. Aš ne eiti už mano rasės. Kai buvau karys turėjau "Aš tave myliu ilgą laiką" patirtį Azijoje. Tai paliko mane jausmas nepatogiai, kai yra Azijos moterys šalia manęs. Kartais pasijuntu labai nepatogiai, nors atskiri individai to nenusipelnė. Vizito į Tailandą metu aš pastebėjau, kad vienintelis būdas užkirsti kelią save pasiūlė gatvėje buvo imtis balta moteris su manimi kaip nepilnametis.<br/><br/>Aha dalykas yra tai, kad Kinijoje nėra daug baltųjų žmonių (ar jų apskritai nėra), bet „baltose“ vietose (ar bent jau Australijoje) yra gana daug azijiečių, kurie privertė mane galvoti apie šį klausimą ...<br/><br/>Galbūt kai kuriose šalies dalyse, kur jūs laikotės (prisiminkite, plunksnų paukščiai...), kaip ir respublikonams, atrodo, kad dauguma žmonių yra respublikonai ir tt Nors tai gali būti tik nedidelė mažuma, kad esate apsuptas.<br/><br/>Ir kiek aš žinau, Kinijoje yra daug baltų, daugiausia verslo ir tt Bet tai paprasta, dauguma žmonių yra Azijos, todėl jie nori Azijos mergaičių (šunys kaip šunys , katės kaip katės, dauguma žmonių nori savo natūra). Ir čia nėra nieko blogo. Tas pats pasakytina ir apie baltąsias šalis.<br/><br/>Manau, kad azijiečiai yra labiausiai gražus. Deja, man 2 aš įsitraukė į mano gyvenimą vienas buvo naudojant mane mano vietoje / interneto seniai ir neseniai vienas buvo aukso kasimo kvailas kalė. Ji niekada baigė koledžą ir buvo 30. Būčiau labai laimingas, jei sutikau protingas mielas Azijos moteris netoli mano amžiaus, kuris nebuvo aukso kasėjas.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic taip, nes kai vyras myli giliai jis visada gerai su jumis lovoje nesvarbu dydis papai ar odos spalva ir tikras vyras visada gerbti mergaitę visuose santykiuose, pavyzdžiui, motinos, sesers, žmonos, draugės ir tt<br/><br/>kaip modelis nuo vaikystės gavau savo pradžią su kompanija, vadinama cukraus ir prieskonių. Buvau įdarbintas Japonijoje, o mano šeima buvo dislokuota ten.<br/><br/>Jūs gaunate darbą, nes jie ketina tam tikrą išvaizdą, kas jie nukreipti, ir plotas, kuriame jūs gyvenate.<br/><br/>Praėjusiais metais turėjau palikti pramonę dėl sveikatos priežasčių. Dirbau su daugeliu žmonių, korėjiečių, japonų, kinų, lenkų, vokiečių, amerikiečių, ispanų, arabų. Dirbau su vaikais, suaugusiais, paaugliais iš visų šių etninių grupių.<br/><br/>Aš pusiau balta pusiau indėnų (Lakota), todėl jie mylėjo mano išvaizdą nuo mažens. bet yra daug grožio standartai pramonėje ir ne visi iš jų yra kaip pavaizduota, kai kurie yra padaryta, kad atrodo blogiau, o kai kurie nėra imtasi pakankamai rimtai...<br/><br/>Nope, tai todėl, kad Azijos vyrai yra pavydus ir piktas ir sugalvoti tūkstančius pasiteisinimų kiekvieną retą kartą, kurie Azijos moterys žiniasklaidoje, nes jie pavydi Azijos moterų, ir amerikiečiai nori išlaikyti baltųjų moterų statusą, tai kodėl poros tarp Azijos moterų ir baltųjų vyrų yra boikotuojamas ir visi kiti rasės su baltųjų moterų yra stumiama, tai balta moterys su kitų rasių, nes tai balta moterys balta vyrai ir baltosios moterys su kitų rasių Jūs turite suprasti Amerikos politinę socialinę inžineriją per visus šiuos žiniasklaidos, demokratų, politikos ir propagandos metus.<br/><br/>Bet kokiu atveju, tokiose šalyse kaip Kinija, Japonija, Korėja jie turi tik azijietiškus vyrus ir azijietes, ir vienintelės išimtys yra tada, kai jie importuoja baltą moterį, kad sukurtų jiems fantazijos sceną, bet tai nėra tiek daug, draudžiama atskleisti kai kurių azijietiškų vyrų neapykantą ir pavydą.<br/><br/>Azijos berniukai bus laimingi, jei pasakysite kažką prieš kitus vyrus, bet jie bus piktas, jei jūs sakote, kad Azijos mergina mirs už šviesiaplaukė mergina data gražus Kaukazo / baltas vaikinas, jie bandys priversti Azijos moterys padaryti nieko prieš šiuos vyrus į šių mažų vokalinio grupės Azijos vyrų jaustis geriau savo neapykantos, pasiteisinimų, rasizmo ir pavydo. Štai kodėl Azijos moterys nėra tiek daug rodomos, nes Azijos vyrai bus pikti, nes baltos moterys negali būti pakeistos, o Amerikos propaganda yra apie baltas moteris su baltais vyrais, baltas moteris su kita rase, baltas moteris prieš baltus vyrus kitai vyrų rasei, baltas moteris visur.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Nuomonės savininkas<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Visi žiniasklaidos ir propagandos pasiteisinimai ir visi melai dėl rasizmo, pavydo ir neapykantos yra nenaudojami prieš baltaodes moteris vyrus, kurie išranda pasiteisinimus, o baltaodės moterys visą laiką žiniasklaidoje, supranta, kad Amerikos socialinę inžineriją kuria demokratai, demokratai nekenčia baltaodžių vyrų, o populiariausios poros būtų baltaodžiai vyrai ir azijietės, bet tai siaubinga porai baltao rasistų, kurie yra blogi. Tai Amerikos politinė problema.<br/><br/>Manau, kad tai priespauda prieš kitų rasių vyrų ego, todėl baltieji vaikinai turi atrodyti blogai, būti tam tikri anekdotai, būti minkšti, o scenos su baltomis moterimis ir kitomis rasėmis yra priešingos baltųjų vyrų ir ne baltųjų moterų scenoms. |
