| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Per Biblijos C2000 SeriesShall mes kreipiamės į Apaštalų darbų knyga, 1 skyrius, kaip mes pradedame mūsų tyrimą ankstyvosios bažnyčios.<br/>Lukas, Apaštalų darbų knygos autorius, Pauliaus apaštalo draugas, kuris taip pat buvo Evangelijos autorius Pagal Luką, parašė šiuos du traktatus draugui Teofiliui. Teofilis yra graikų vardas. Tai vardas, turintis gražią prasmę. Vardas reiškia Dievo mylėtoją. Yra tokių, kurie tiki, kad tai nebuvo žmogus, bet kad Evangelija ir Apaštalų darbų knyga buvo skirta Dievo mylėtojams, kad ir kas jūs būtumėte. Yra ir kitų tradicijų, teigiančių, kad Teofilius iš tikrųjų buvo Luko meistras. Kad tais laikais gydytojai buvo vergai, paprastai turtingo globėjo vergas. Luko mokytojas buvo Teofilis; jis paleido Luką į misionieriškas keliones su Pauliumi. Taigi Lukas rašo savo buvusiam mokytojui. Tai ankstyvoji Bažnyčios tradicija, tačiau, žinoma, jos neįmanoma įrodyti, kaip ir daugelio kitų tradicijų.<br/>Taip pat yra tokių, kurie tiki, kad Paulius, būdamas Troadėje, regėjime matė vyrą, kuris jam šaukė: „Ateik į Makedoniją ir padėk mums!“ Tas vyras buvo ne kas kitas, kaip Lukas. Mat pirmasis, kurį Paulius sutiko, atvykdamas į Makedoniją, buvo Lukas. Apaštalų darbų knygoje skaitome, kad Lukas, pasiekęs Apaštalų darbų knygos skyrių, pradėjo daugiau rašyti pirmuoju, o ne trečiuoju asmeniu. Taigi akivaizdu, kad būtent šiuo konkrečiu Apaštalų darbų momentu Lukas tapo Pauliaus draugu ir pradėjo keliauti su juo. Jis pradėjo vartoti įvardžius „mes“ ir „mes“, o ne „jie“ ir „jie“. Tai, be abejo, yra vieta, kur Lukas tapo dalyviu ir liudininku tų dalykų, kurie vyko nuo šio momento. Mes jums tai parodysime, kai pasieksime tą tašką.<br/>Jis pradeda Apaštalų darbus susiedamas jį su Evangelija pagal Luką. Įdomu tai, kad pats paskutinis dalykas, kurį Lukas įrašo savo Evangelijoje, yra pats pirmas dalykas, kurį jis įrašo Apaštalų darbuose. Mes randame Luko Evangeliją uždarymo, kaip Jėzus pasakoja savo mokiniams laukti Jeruzalėje, kol jie bus ištverti su galia iš aukštybių. Ir tada Jėzus pakilo į dangų, ir taip jis uždaro Evangeliją. Atidarymo Apaštalų darbų, jis rašo,<br/>Pirmoje knygoje, Teofiliau, aš parašiau apie viską, ką Jėzus pradėjo daryti ir mokyti (Apd 1, 1)<br/>Raktinis žodis prasidėjo. Evangelija pagal Luką yra ne visa istorija Jėzaus Kristaus tarnystės. Tai tik Jėzaus Kristaus tarnystės pradžia. Jėzus ir toliau tarnauti žmonių poreikius. Jėzus ir toliau gydyti ligonius. Jėzus toliau kelia mirusiuosius. Jėzus ir toliau tarnauja savo meilei ir Evangelijai pasauliui, tik dabar Jis tarnauja per tuos mokinius, kurie buvo patepti Jo Šventąja Dvasia. Bet Kristaus tarnystė tęsiasi; iš esmės, yra prielaida, kad Lukas mano Apaštalų darbų. Pirmasis traktatas apie viską, kad Jėzus pradėjo, tiek daryti ir mokyti.<br/>Dėl to Apaštalų darbai yra nebaigta knyga, nes Viešpats ir šiandien darbuojasi per gyvenimus tų, kurie pasišventę būti Dievo įrankiais. Būti vadovaujamas ir vadovaujamas ir pateptas Jo Šventąja Dvasia, tęsti Jėzaus tarnystę pasaulyje šiandien. Dabar Dievas įsakė, kad Jo darbas turėtų būti atliekamas per žmogaus priemonėmis. Aš nesakau, kad jis turi būti atliktas. Dievas gali panaudoti angeliškas būtybes Savo darbui, ir ateis laikas, Apreiškimo knygos metu, kai Dievas panaudos angelus skelbti savo Evangeliją žmonėms visame pasaulyje. Apreiškimas, skyrius 14, "Pirmasis angelas, skrendantis per dangaus vidurį, turintis amžinąją Evangeliją" ( Apr 14: 6 ). Bet šiuo metu, Dievas pasirinko naudoti žmogiškus įrankius. Kaip netobulas, kaip jie gali būti, dar tai, ką Dievas įsakė naudoti. Įdomus dalykas apie tai, Dievas bus naudoti mane ir Dievas bus naudoti jums. Tiek daug kartų, mes elgetauti off, "Viešpatie, aš negaliu kalbėti. Aš niekada negalėjo kalbėti prieš ar net dabar, Viešpatie." Kaip Mozė bandė elgetauti nuo Dievo kvietimą. Jeremijas tarė: "Viešpatie, aš tik vaikas; niekas ketina klausytis manęs." Ir mes visi turime mūsų pasiteisinimų, kodėl mes negalime būti naudojamas. Ar ne mes? Mes visi žinome priežastis, kodėl Dievas negalėjo naudoti mus.<br/>Kartą, kai Viešpats pašaukė pranašą atlikti Jo darbą, Jis tarė: “Viešpatie, siųsk ką tik nori”. Viešpats atsakė: “Štai aš pašaukiau tave”. “Gera mintis, Viešpatie, siųsk ką tik nori”. Taip dažnai mes esame tokioje padėtyje, "Viešpatie, pasiųsk ką tik nori, ką tik nori, išskyrus mane, Viešpatie." Ir vis dėlto, Dievas įsakė naudotis mumis.<br/>Dabar, kiekvienas iš mūsų gali parodyti savo netobulumus. Kiekvienas iš mūsų gali nurodyti savo trūkumus, ir visi mes galime rasti pasiteisinimą, kodėl Dievas nenori naudoti mane. Bet vis dėlto, Dievas pasirinko naudoti jums. Kad per savo gyvenimą Jis gali atskleisti save į skurstantį pasaulį. Jūs įdomu, kada Dievas turi tokias priemones naudoti, kaip Jis kada nors gavo darbą, ar ne?<br/>Iki tos dienos, kurią buvo paimtas į dangų, pirmiau per Šventąją Dvasią davęs savo išrinktiesiems apaštalams įsakymų (Apd 1, 2).<br/>Tai, ką jis baigė Luko Evangeliją. Tą dieną, kai Jėzus buvo paimtas, po to, kai jis liepė apaštalams laukti galios dovana.<br/>Tiems, kuriems jis (apaštalai) po savo kančios [arba mirties] pasirodė esąs gyvas daugeliu neklystančių įrodymų (Apd 1, 3).<br/>Sunku paneigti Jėzaus Kristaus prisikėlimo faktą. Buvau linksmas, taip pat erzina ir sudirgintas straipsniu, kurį perskaičiau Santa Ana registre praėjusį šeštadienį. Apie kūrimo mokslą ir evoliucines teorijas, pristatomas apskričių mokyklose. Taigi, šis profesorius pasakė, kad jis dėsto mokslo klasę, ir todėl jie užsiima tik faktais, ir kad jie neturi vietos teorijoms. Kadangi mokslas yra pagrįstas faktais, o kūrinija yra pagrįsta religiniais prietarais. Reikia daug tikėjimo, kad tikėtumėte religinėmis teorijomis. Kai susiduriate su faktais, galite juos tiesiog priimti. Aš pagalvojau: „Labai įdomu, kad šioje mokslo klasėje jie mane išmokė, kad pasauliui yra keturi milijardai metų. Dabar jie moko, kad pasauliui yra dvylika milijardų metų. Tai buvo ne taip seniai, kad aš nuėjau į mokyklą. "<br/>Įdomu tai, kad Biblija niekada neturėjo būti peržiūrėta ar atnaujinta, kad atitiktų dabartinius duomenis, kuriuos atrado žmonės. Ir vis dėlto, jei šiandien paimtumėte mano vidurinės mokyklos mokslo vadovėlius ir bandytumėte iš jų mokyti mokslo klasę, pastebėtumėte, kad daugelis dalykų, kurie buvo mokomi kaip mokslinis faktas, kai buvau vidurinėje mokykloje, nebėra pripažįstami kaip mokslinis faktas. Paprasta ląstelių protoplazma nebėra paprasta ląstelė, bet labai sudėtinga. Jei istorijoje yra kokių nors faktų, kuriuos galima patvirtinti, tai yra Jėzaus Kristaus prisikėlimo iš mirusiųjų faktas.<br/>Turime teismų praktikos sistemą, pagrįstą liudytojų parodymais. Jei žmogus yra kaltinamas nusikaltimu ir yra žmonių, kurie matė tą nusikaltimą, kai jis buvo padarytas, ir jie yra prilyginami standartams, ir jie prisiekia pasakyti tiesą, visą tiesą ir nieko, išskyrus tiesą, todėl padėk jiems Dievas. Ir jų apklausoje jie tvirtina, kad "Aš mačiau tą žmogų banke gegužės 23 d. Mačiau, kaip jis ištraukė ginklą iš savo apsiausto. Girdėjau, kaip jis reikalavo, kad jam būtų atiduoti visi pinigai. Mačiau, kaip jis paliko banką. Aš mačiau jį kaip tokį, kuris buvo suimtas lauke.“ Ir jei jūs galite turėti tris ar keturis liudytojus, kurie parodys tą žmogų ir parodys jų liudijimą, jis bus pripažintas kaltu. Jis yra tas, kuris tai padarė. Mes turime du ar tris liudytojus, kurie liudija tą pačią istoriją apie tą žmogų, ir tai yra priimta kaip faktas, kad jis yra tas, kuris padarė nusikaltimą ir yra kaltas. Jūs turite liudytojų, kurie prisiekė pasakyti tiesą, kuri yra tikrinama.<br/>Po Jėzaus mirties, kai Jis prisikėlė, Jis pasirodė daugybei skirtingų žmonių, kurie prisiekė, kad Jį matė. Kad jie kalbėjo su Juo, kad Jis pasirodė jiems įvairiose vietose skirtingomis aplinkybėmis. Keturiasdešimt dienų jis buvo kartu su jais. Ir vienu metu, iki penkių šimtų žmonių, kurie buvo susirinkę vienoje vietoje, Jis pasirodė. Sunku tiesiog atmesti ar paneigti šių žmonių liudijimą. Tai yra diskredituoti visą mūsų jurisprudenciją. Bet ne tik tai, kad tie vyrai, kurie liudijo, kad jie matė prisikėlusį Viešpatį, kad jie kalbėjosi su juo, kad jie valgė su juo, jie visi, išskyrus vieną, susidūrė su smurtinėmis mirtimis kitų žmonių rankose, nes jie teigė, kad pasakojimas, kurį jie pasakė, buvo tiesa. Jūs kalbate apie liudytojus, prisiekusius sakyti tiesą, visą tiesą, nieko, bet tiesą. Jei dėl to liudytojo gyvybei grėstų pavojus, ir tai buvo melas, bent vienas iš jų būtų sulaužęs spaudimą. Jie būtų prisipažinę visai apgaulei. "Jis pasirodė gyvas po savo kančios daugybe neklystančių įrodymų."<br/>Jis buvo jiems matomas keturiasdešimt dienų ir kalbėjo jiems apie Dievo karalystę (Apd 1, 3).<br/>Kartais mes kaltina mokinius dėl jų klausimų apie Dievo karalystės laiką. Leiskite prisiminti, kad Dievo karalystė buvo mėgstamiausia tema Jėzaus Kristaus. Jis visada kalbėjo apie Dievo karalystę, ir tai yra didelė viltis, kad jis buvo sodinami į visų žmonių širdyse. Daiktai bus ne visada toliau sugadintas, kaip jie yra. Pasaulis nesiruošia eiti amžinai pagal tamsos galios, pagal blogio vergijos. Dievas ketina vieną dieną įkurti savo karalystę žemėje. Teisiojo džiaugsmo ir taikos karalystė. "Jėzus valdys ten, kur saulė ėjo savo viena po kitos einančiomis kelionėmis, ir jo karalystė tęsis nuo kranto iki kranto." Ir ta diena bus šlovingiausia diena, kurią pasaulis kada nors matė, nes ligos, kančios ir skausmas bus panaikinti Jo karalystėje. Kaip nuodėmė ir godumas, ir tie dalykai, kurie padarė pasaulį tokia nepakenčiama vieta, bus panaikinti Jo karalystėje. Bedievis komercializmas, žmogaus išnaudojimas, visi šie dalykai buvo panaikinti Jo šlovingoje karalystėje, kai Jis karaliavo. Nenuostabu, kad mokiniai norėjo jį gauti. Aš noriu jį gauti; Aš nekantrauju, kad Jo karalystė ateis. Ir Jėzus mums pasakė, kai mes meldžiamės, pirmasis prašymas yra: "Teateinie tavo karalystė. Tavo valia bus padaryta žemėje, kaip ji yra danguje" (Mt 6:10 ). Tai yra teisingas troškimas, kad mes visi turėtume turėti. Aš trokštu Dievo karalystės. Ir taip jis kalbėjo jiems per tą keturiasdešimties dienų karalystės laikotarpį.<br/>Susirinkęs su jais, jis įsakė, kad jie nepasitrauktų iš Jeruzalės, bet lauktų Tėvo pažado, apie kurį Jis pasakė: ‘Jūs esate girdėję iš manęs’“ (Apd 1, 4).<br/>Jis sakė: „Žiūrėkite, palaukite čia, Jeruzalėje, kol gausite Tėvo pažadą“. Šis pažadas, apie kurį Jis kalba, be abejo, yra Joelio pažadas, kuriame Viešpats pažadėjo: „Ir vėliau, – sako Viešpats, – Aš išliesiu savo Dvasią ant kiekvieno kūno; ir jūsų sūnūs bei dukterys pranašaus, ir jūsų jaunuoliai sapnuos sapnus, ir jūsų seni vyrai matys regėjimus. Tėvo pažadas: ateis diena, kai Dievas išlies savo Dvasią kiekvienam kūnui, visiems tikintiesiems, ir kiekvienas gaus tą dinamiką iš Dievo.<br/>Jonas krikštijo vandeniu, o jūs po kelių dienų būsite pakrikštyti Šventąja Dvasia (Apd 1, 5).<br/>Krikšto idėja buvo ta, kad išsiveržimas, bapteedzo. Jonas krikštijo vandeniu, panardintas žmones į vandenį, "Jūs būsite panardintas į Šventąją Dvasią ne daug dienų."<br/>Susirinkusieji paklausė Jį: ‘‘Viešpatie, gal Tu šiuo metu atkursi Izraelio karalystę?’‘<br/>"Kada tai bus, Viešpatie? Kada laikas šiam atkūrimui?" Ir Jėzus kalbasi su jais dabar, ne apie karalystę, bet apie galią, kad jie ketina gauti už paslaugą. Ir taip Jis šepečiu į šalį savo klausimą.<br/>Jis sakė jiems: „Ne jūsų reikalas žinoti laiką ir metą, kuriuos Tėvas nustatė savo galia“ (Apd 1, 7).<br/>"Tai ne jums žinoti." Jie nuolat gyveno tikėdamiesi nedelsiant įkurti karalystę. Per visą Jėzaus gyvenimą, jie laukė, kad jis bet kuriuo metu eitų į telefono kabiną ir išeitų kaip pasaulio gelbėtojas. Shazzam! Parodyti savo galią ir nuversti pasaulio vyriausybes, nustatant Dievo karalystę žemėje. Ir jie laukė kiekvieną dieną, kad šis pokytis įvyktų. Ir kaskart, kai Jėzus kalbėdavo apie ėjimą į Jeruzalę, tapdamas nuodėmingo žmogaus rankomis, o po to nukryžiuodamas, "O ne, Viešpatie. Ne, ne, tu nesupranti karalystės, Viešpatie. Būk taip toli nuo tavęs." Kai Jėzus mirė ant kryžiaus, jie visi buvo labai nusivylę.<br/>Du mokiniai pakeliui į Emausą, taip liūdna. "Ei, bičiuliai. Kaip jūs taip liūdna, kaip jūsų vaikščioti kartu?" "Ką tu turi galvoje? Jūs turite būti svetimas aplink čia, jei jūs nežinote, kas atsitiko pastaruoju metu Jeruzalėje." "Ką?" "O, bičiulis vardu Jėzus iš Nazareto... O žmogus, tai buvo galingas ir galingas. Dievo patepimas buvo ant jo gyvenimo. Mes tikėjomės, kad jame buvo Izraelio išlaisvinimas, bet jie jį nukryžiavo. Mes tikėjomės ... dabar jis mirė." Dabar Jis prisikėlė, ir Jis sako, "Po kelių dienų, bičiuliai, jūs ketinate gauti Tėvo pažadą." "O, kas pažadas? Karalystės įkūrimo pažadas?" Matote, tai buvo teisėta, kad jie turėtų paklausti. "Ar tai Viešpats? Gerai! Ar jau metas? Ar dabar įsteigsi savo karalystę? „Ne, ne tu žinai tuos laikus, kuriuos Tėvas yra paskyręs, ar kuriuos Tėvas turi savo galia. Bet jūs gausite galią, kai Šventoji Dvasia nužengs ant jūsų.“<br/>Dabar čia naudojamas graikų prielinksnis epi, reiškiantis naują santykį, kurį jie turėjo turėti su Šventąja Dvasia. Evangelijoje pagal Joną, 14 skyriuje, kaip Jėzus yra pažadėjęs atsiųsti Šventąją Dvasią, Jis pasakė: "Aš nepaliksiu tavęs nepatogiai. Aš ateisiu pas jus ir melsiu Tėvą, ir Jis atsiųs jums kitą Guodėją, būtent Tiesos Dvasią, kurios pasaulis neįstengia priimti, nes Jos nemato ir nepažįsta. Jūs Ją pažįstate, nes Ji yra su jumis ir bus jumyse“ (Jn 14, 17-18). Tas pats graikų prielinksnis, kaip ir mūsų, tik jie rašybos jį "į" vietoj "į." Du kartus santykiai ten Jonas: Jis yra su jumis, bet Jis ketina būti gyvena jumyse. Bet dabar Jėzus sakė, kad jūs ketinate gauti galią, kai Šventoji Dvasia ateina ant tavęs. Graikų prielinksnis epi, kuris įvairiuose Naujojo Testamento tekstuose verčiamas kaip „per“ arba „man tai patinka“, „perpildytas“.<br/>Evangelijos pagal Joną 7-ame skyriuje skaitome: „Paskutinę dieną, didžiąją šventės dieną, Jėzus stovėjo ant šventyklos kalno ir šaukė žmonėms: ‘Jei kas trokšta, teateina pas mane ir tegeria; ir kas gers vandenį, kurį aš duosiu, iš jo gelmių tekės gyvojo vandens upeliai.’ Jonas pasakė: „Jis kalbėjo apie Dvasią, kuri dar nebuvo duota tiems, kurie Jį tiki“ (Jn 7, 37-39). Ką Jis kalbėjo apie Dvasią, kad ji tekėtų kaip gyvojo vandens upė. Man patinka, kai „Dvasia perpildo“ jus, arba perpildo jus, arba perpildo jus. Taigi trigubas santykis: Jis yra su jumis prieš jūsų atsivertimą, Jis yra tas, kuris leidžia jums suprasti, kad esate nusidėjėlis, Jis yra tas, kuris nurodo į Jėzų Kristų kaip atsakymą, nes Jis įtikina pasaulį apie nuodėmę, teisumą ir teismą. Tą akimirką, kai atversite savo gyvenimą ir širdį Jėzui Kristui ir pakviesite Jį ateiti, ateina Šventoji Dvasia ir pradeda apsigyventi jumyse. „Argi nežinote, kad nesate saviškiai, kad esate nupirkti už didelę kainą, todėl šlovinkite Dievą savo kūnu ir dvasia, kurie yra Jo, ir argi nežinote, kad jūsų kūnas yra jumyse esančios Šventosios Dvasios šventykla? Negerkite vyno, kuriame gausu gėrimo, bet būkite pilni Dvasios“ (1 Kor 6:19-20; Ef 5:18). Bet dabar yra trečias santykis. Tai įgalinanti patirtis.<br/>Kai ant jūsų nužengs Šventoji Dvasia, jūs gausite jos galybės ir tapsite mano liudytojais“ (Apd 1:8).<br/>Ir taip dinamika, būti Jėzaus Kristaus liudytojas. Įdomu tai, kad žodis liudyti graikų kalba yra žodis martus iš kur mes gauname mūsų žodį kankinio. Ir graikų kalba tai reiškia kankinio. Liudytojas yra tas, kuris ne tik skelbia tai, ką tiki, bet ir gyvena tuo, kuo tiki, yra tas, kuo tiki, ir taip stipriai tiki, kad prireikus mirs dėl to, kuo tiki. Štai koks stiprus yra jo tikėjimas. Jis yra martus. Jis nebijo mirti už tai, kuo tiki.<br/>Kai Paulius buvo pakeliui į Jeruzalę, iš Cezarėjos atvyko Agabas ir, paėmęs Pauliaus juostą, susirišo ją, sakydamas: „Vyras, kuriam priklauso ši juosta, bus pririštas prie Jeruzalės“. Pauliaus draugai pradėjo verkti, šaukdami: „O, Pauliau, neik, neik!“ Jis tarė: „Ką turi galvoje tos ašaros? Manai, mane atkalbėsi? Manai, kad nerimauju dėl surišimo? Esu pasiruošęs mirti?“ Jis buvo martus. „Aš pasiruošęs mirti.“ Mirtis už tikėjimą nepavertė tavęs kankiniu, nes tu buvai kankinys, tu buvai nužudytas, nes buvai liudytojas, nes tikėjai, kad esi toks stiprus. Taigi, tai nepadarė tavęs liudytoju, tai tik įrodė, kas tu buvai. Tu buvai liudininkas visą laiką. Jei nebūtum martus, tu niekada nebūtum miręs. Tu būtum atsisakęs; tu būtum pasakęs: "Oho, oho, palauk, palauk. Laikykis, pakeiskime kursą čia. Manau, kad aš padariau klaidą." Tada tu sakai: "Na, jis nebuvo martas. Arklio vagystė nepadaro tavęs arklio vagimi; tai tik įrodo, kad tu buvai. Niekas nevagia arklio, nebent jis yra arklio vagis. Taigi, vagystė nepadaro tavęs arklio vagimi, tai tik įrodo, kad jūs buvote visi kartu. Kankinimas tik įrodo, kad buvote liudytojas, martas. „Ir jūs būsite liudytojai.“ Ir argi nėra įdomu, kad dauguma jų buvo kankinti? „Liudytojai man“.<br/>Liudytojas turėjo būti Jeruzalėje ir visoje Judėjoje (Apd 1, 8).<br/>Liudijimas prasidėjo namuose. Sunkiausia vieta, ar ne? Pradėti nuo namų Jeruzalėje, o po to Jeruzalės apylinkėse, Judėjos apylinkėse. Ir tada jis turėjo išplisti į Samariją. Ir tada tai buvo eiti į tolimiausius pasaulio dalis. Ir kaip mes studijuoti Apaštalų darbų knygą, mes matome, kad labai pažangą. Kaip liudijimas prasidėjo Jeruzalėje. Mes gauti, kad kitame skyriuje. Pažiūrėsime, kaip jis pradės plėstis visoje Judėjoje. Paskui Pilypas nukeliavo į Samariją. Paskui Paulius ir Barnabas buvo pašaukti keliauti į tolimiausius pasaulio kampelius. Ir taip liudijimas išplito per patepimą ir Šventosios Dvasios įgaliojimą.<br/>Tai pasakęs, jiems bežiūrint, Jėzus pakilo aukštyn, ir debesis Jį paslėpė nuo jų akių (Apd 1, 9).<br/>Tai yra galutinis pažadas, kurį Jėzus davė savo mokiniams. Tai yra, paskutiniai žodžiai prieš Jo pakilimą. Žinoma, vėliau Jis atėjo ir kalbėjo su Pauliumi ir kitais, bet prieš Jo pakilimą, tai yra Jo galutinis žodis. Tai pasakęs, jiems bežiūrint, Jėzus pakilo aukštyn, ir debesis Jį paslėpė nuo jų akių.<br/>Kai jie, akių nenuleisdami, žiūrėjo į žengiantį dangun Jėzų, štai prie jų atsirado du vyrai baltais drabužiais<br/>Manoma, kad jie buvo angelai.<br/>“Vyrai galilėjiečiai, ko stovite, žiūrėdami į dangų? Tas pats Jėzus, paimtas nuo jūsų į dangų, sugrįš taip pat, kaip Jį matėte žengiantį į dangų” (Apd 1:11).<br/>Jie matė, kaip Jis pakilo į dangų, ir jie pamatys Jį, kai Jis sugrįš. „Štai Viešpats ateina su dešimčia tūkstančių savo šventųjų įvykdyti žemei nuosprendžio“ (Jud 1:14-15). Ir tada: „Tam, kuris pamilo mus ir paaukojo save už mus, ir padarė mus savo Dievui, karaliams ir kunigams, kurie su juo viešpataus žemėje, štai ateis Viešpats; kiekviena akis išvys jį, ir tie, kurie jį perdūrė, apraudos“ (Apr 1, 5–7). Taigi Viešpats ateina. Kiekviena akis pamatys Jį. Jehovos liudytojai sako, kad Jis jau atėjo, bet tai buvo slaptas atėjimas. Kadangi tik mokiniai matė Jį einantį, tik Jehovos liudytojų mokiniai matė Jį grįžtantį. Bet Jėzus atsakė: „Jei jums sakytų: ‘Jis atėjo slaptai’, ir įėjo į slaptą kambarį, tai netikėkite“ (Mt 24, 26), – tuomet jūs turite pasirinkti – tikėti Jėzumi arba jais.<br/>Tas pats Jėzus, paimtas nuo jūsų į dangų, sugrįš taip pat, kaip Jį matėte žengiantį į dangų”.<br/>Dabar yra labai įdomi eilutė II Jono, eilėraštis Apaštalų darbų 1:7 , "Nes daugelis apgavikų atėjo į pasaulį, kuris neišpažįsta, kad Jėzus Kristus atėjo kūne." Tai, deja, yra prasta vertimas graikų. Nes šis veidrodis yra dabarties metu ir turėtų būti išversta "ateina kūne." Tie, kurie neigia, kad Jėzus Kristus ateina kūne. Ką Jonas sako apie juos? "Jie yra apgavikas ir antikristas. Žiūrėkite, kad neprarastume, ką esame nuveikę, bet kad gautume visą atlygį. Kas tik peržengia ribą ir nesilaiko Kristaus mokslo, neturi Dievo. Tas, kuris laikosi Kristaus doktrinos, turi ir Tėvą, ir Sūnų. Ir jei kas nors ateina prie jūsų durų (šeštadienio rytą) ir neatsineša šio mokymo, nepriimkite jo į savo namus ir neatsisveikinkite su juo. Nes tas, kuris atsisveikina su juo, yra jo piktų darbų dalyvis“ (2 Jn 1, 7–11). Užduokite jiems vieną klausimą: „Ar Jėzus ateis kūne?“ Tiesiog užduokite jiems šį klausimą. Ir jei jie sako ne, tiesiog prisiminkite, ką Jonas jus įspėjo ir ką Jonas jums pasakė. "Jei kas nors neišpažįsta, kad Jėzus Kristus ateina kūne." Ar prisimenate, kai jis buvo su mokiniais ir sakė: "Duok man valgyti"? Jis atsakė: "Žinote, dvasios nevalgo; Palieskite mane. Matote? Tai aš". Taigi, tas pats Jėzus vėl ateina tokiu pačiu būdu, kaip jie pamatė jį eiti į dangų. Ir aš, už vieną, tikiu, kad šis atėjimas yra labai greitai.<br/>Tuomet jie sugrįžo į Jeruzalę iš vadinamojo Alyvų kalno, esančio netoli Jeruzalės, tokiu atstumu, koks leidžiamas nueiti per sabatą. Atėję jie susirinko aukštutiniame kambaryje, kur buvo apsistoję,Petras ir Jokūbas, Jonas ir Andriejus, Pilypas ir Tomas, Baltramiejus ir Matas, Alfiejaus sūnus Jokūbas, Simonas Uolusis ir Judas, Jokūbo brolis. Jie visi ištvermingai ir vieningai atsidėjo maldai ir prašymui kartu su moterimis ir Jėzaus motina Marija bei jo broliais (Apd 1, 12–14).<br/>Tai paskutinis paminėjimas apie Mariją, Jėzaus motiną. Šiuo metu ir nuo šio momento nėra daugiau paminėjimo apie ją Apaštalų darbuose ar laiškuose. Jokio paminėjimo apie jos mirtį ar stebuklingą pakilimą į dangų, be mirties. Šventajame Rašte nieko nepaminėta. Tai tyla.<br/>Jo broliai tikriausiai turėjo omenyje Jokūbą ir Judą bei kitus brolius, Juozapo ir Marijos sūnus.<br/>Viršutinis kambarys - yra keletas, kurie sako, kad tai yra tas pats viršutinis kambarys, kuriame Jėzus turėjo Paskutinę vakarienę su savo mokiniais. Ir vis dėlto, yra ir kitų, kurie mano, kad šis viršutinis kambarys yra kambarys šventyklos apylinkėse, kur susitiko ankstyvoji bažnyčia. Padaryk savo pasirinkimą.<br/>Tomis dienomis, atsistojęs tarp mokinių, Petras tarė: „Vyrai ir broliai, šimtas dvidešimt vyrų, turėjo išsipildyti Rašto žodžiai, kuriuos Šventoji Dvasia pranašiškai išsakė Dovydo lūpomis apie Judą, tapusį Jėzaus suėmėjų vadovu“ (Apd 1, 15-16).<br/>Čia vėl Petras vis dar yra tas pats skubotas aš. Jie laukia maldos ir maldavimo, o Petras atsistoja ir sako: "Bičiuliai, yra Raštas, kuris turi būti įvykdytas". Ir jūs žinote, kad jis ketina judėti į priekį, "Leiskite programa eiti, mesti burtus ir sužinoti, kas ketina imtis Judo vietą." Aš manau, kad Petras vėl buvo kūne, pasireiškianti, kad skubotai pobūdį, kuris buvo jo. Ir aš manau, kad ateities bažnyčios istorija Apaštalų darbų knygoje tai nurodo. Mane domina Petro Raštų supratimas, kaip jis cituoja iš tiek daug vietų Senajame Testamente. Petras labai gerai supranta Senojo Testamento raštus, o tai jam yra labai naudinga.<br/>Atkreipkite dėmesį, kad Petras priskiria Šventajai Dvasiai tuos dalykus, kuriuos parašė Dovydas. Taigi, "Visas Raštas yra Dievo įkvėptas" (2 Timotiejui 3:16 ). Ne Šventojo Rašto dalis. Nes jei man pasakysite, kad dalis Raštų yra įkvėpti Dievo, tada aš turiu jūsų paklausti: "Kurios dalys yra įkvėptos ir kurios nėra įkvėptos?" Ir tada jūs esate autoritetas, kuris man sako, kuria dalimi aš galiu tikėti ir kuria dalimi aš negaliu tikėti. Ir tą minutę, kai Dievas nebėra autoritetas, bet jūs esate autoritetas, aš esu bėdoje. Saugokitės tų, kurie sako: “Negalite tikėti visais Raštais”. Pats Raštas sako: “Visas Raštas yra Dievo įkvėptas”. Ir čia Lukas rašo apie tai, ką kalbėjo Petras, kad Dovydas iš tikrųjų buvo Šventosios Dvasios atstovas. Šventoji Dvasia kalbėjo apie Judą Dovydo lūpomis.<br/>Jis juk buvo priskaitytas prie mūsų ir turėjo dalį šioje tarnystėje. O dabar jis nupirko dirvą nedorybei atlyginti ir parpuolė veidu žemėn (Apd 1:17-18).<br/>Jis nupirko lauką, puodžiaus lauką, kaip Zacharijas paskelbė vienuoliktame skyriuje.<br/>Ir, puolęs veidu žemėn, Jis perplyšo pusiau, ir visi Jo viduriai išvirto“ (Apd 1:18).<br/>Yra tokių, kurie randa neatitikimus Raštuose, nes vienoje iš evangelijų mums sakoma, kad kai Judas grįžo ir bandė grąžinti pinigus, jie sakė: "Ei, tai jūsų problema. Mes negalime to paimti". Ir įdėkite jį atgal į šventyklos iždą. "Tai kraujo pinigai". Tada jis išmetė jį ten ant šventyklos grindų ir išėjo ir pakabino. Čia Petras mums sako, kad jis nukrito galva ir tiesiog popped. Ir yra tie, kurie įsivaizduoja neatitikimą. Labai paprasta, jis pakilo į medį pakabinti save, pririšo virvę aplink kaklą ir pririšo jį prie galūnės ir šoktelėjo. Ir rudenį jėga arba nuplėšė virvę ar galvą, ir jis nukrito žemyn į kanjoną ir kaip jis sakė čia.<br/>Tai pasidarė žinoma visiems Jeruzalės gyventojams, ir anas laukas jų kalba buvo pavadintas Akeldama, tai yra Kraujo laukas. Nes Psalmių knygoje parašyta: ‘Jo kiemas tepavirsta dykyne, ir tegul niekas ten nebegyvena’, ir: ‘Jo vyskupas tepasiima kitą’ (Apd 1, 19–20).<br/>Dabar iš tikrųjų jis cituoja iš dviejų skirtingų psalmių čia. Iš Psalmių 69: 25 , jis įdeda jį kartu su Psalmių 109:8 . Ir sudėjus kartu du jis randa šias pranašystes apie Judą.<br/>„Todėl tarp šitų žmonių“ (Apd 1, 21)<br/>Štai kur jie ieško kažko, kas užimtų Judo vietą, kad taptų apaštalu. Čia yra kvalifikacija, kurios jie ieškojo tuo metu.<br/>Taigi vienam iš vyrų, kurie drauge su mumis vaikščiojo visą laiką, kol Viešpats Jėzus buvo tarp mūsų,<br/>Dabar jūs prisimenate, ten buvo daug mokinių, daug mokinių, iš kurių Jėzus pasirinko dešimt būti apaštalais. Ir žodis apaštalas reiškia "vienas, kuris yra išsiųstas." Arba pasirinko dvylika būti apaštalais, todėl Jis išsiuntė dvylika. Žmonių vyriausybės skaičius. "Mes turime tik vienuolika. Mums reikia vieno imtis Judo vietą, bet mums reikia vieno, kuris buvo su mumis visą laiką nuo pat pradžių su Jėzumi."<br/>Nuo Jono krikštijimo dienos iki tos dienos, kai Jis buvo paimtas iš mūsų aukštyn, žmogus turi būti įšventintas liudyti apie Jo prisikėlimą (Apd 1, 22).<br/>Taigi tai buvo reikalavimai jie ieškojo. Kažkas, kas buvo aplink visą laiką. Nuo Jono krikšto metu į kilimą. Ir tas, kuris matė prisikėlusį Viešpatį, ir taip galėjo atlikti faktą apie prisikėlimą, jų liudijimą apie tai.<br/>Dabar Paulius apaštalas, vėliau teigdamas, kad jis buvo apaštalas, sakė: "Ar aš nemačiau prisikėlusio Kristaus?" Akivaizdu, kad tai buvo vienas iš apaštalavimo reikalavimų. Kažkas manęs paklausė: "Ar šiandien yra apaštalų?" Na, aš nežinau. Aš nemanau, kad yra ta pačia prasme, kaip jie buvo Naujajame Testamente. Žinoma, šiandien nėra nė vieno, kuris galėtų liudyti apie prisikėlimą, kaip jie padarė.<br/>Jie paskyrė du Juozapą, vadinamą Barsabu, kuris buvo vadinamas Justu, ir Motiejų ir meldėsi: “Tu, Viešpatie, kuris pažįsti visų žmonių širdis, parodyk, kurį iš šių dviejų pasirenki,<br/>Manau, kad mes dažnai daro šią klaidą suteikiant Viešpačiui du pasirinkimus, abu neteisingi. Apribojimas Dievą, matote. Mes taip linkę tai padaryti. Akivaizdu, Paulius buvo Dievo pasirinkimas. Petras buvo greitas ir šoktelėjo šautuvą sakydamas: "Ei, mes turime kažką daryti, žinote, turi padėti Dievui. Jūs žinote, vienas trūksta, ir mes turime užpildyti jį." Ir dar, "Dieve, kuris iš šių dviejų norite?" Ir suteikti Dievui du pasirinkimus.<br/>Kad jis galėtų dalyvauti šioje tarnystėje ir apaštalystėje, iš kurios Judas nukrito dėl nusižengimo, kad galėtų eiti į savo vietą. Ir taip jie davė savo burtą ( Apd 1: 25-26 );<br/>Įdomus būdas, kuriuo jie siekė nustatyti Dievo valią. Leiskite mesti kauliukus, sužinoti, kas Dievo valia yra čia. Man įdomu, įvairių būdų, kad žmonės sumanyta atskirti Dievo valią. Senojo Testamento laikais jie turėjo įdomų būdą ateiti pas kunigą, kuris per Urimus ir Tumimus, „šviesas ir tobulybes“ už juos pasiteiravo Viešpaties. Mes nežinome, kas buvo šie Urimai ir Tumimai. Esu tikras, kad tai nebuvo spalvoti akiniai, kuriuos Džozefas Smitas rado su auksinėmis tabletėmis; stebuklingi akiniai, kad juos užsidėję galėtumėte staiga perskaityti hieroglifų raštą.<br/>Yra tie, kurie sako, kad Urimas ir Tumimas iš tikrųjų buvo juodas ir baltas akmuo, kuris buvo dėvimas maišelyje ant kunigo krūtinės. Jie meldėsi ir uždavė Viešpačiui konkretų klausimą. Ar atsimeni, kaip Dovydas klausė Viešpaties: ‘Viešpatie, kada išeisime prieš filistinus?’ Kitą dieną jis vėl klausė: ‘‘Viešpatie, ar mums eiti prieš filistinus?’‘ Jis atsakė: ‘‘‘Kada išeisime?’‘ Jie užduodavo konkrečius klausimus, ir Viešpats nukreipdavo juos per Urimą ir Tuminą. Jie sako, kad kunigas melsis, ieškos Dievo, tada pasieks ir ištrauks vieną iš dviejų akmenų. Jei tai buvo baltas akmuo, tai buvo atsakymas "taip". Jei tai būtų ne, tai būtų juodas akmuo, kurį jis ištrauktų. Kai kurie netgi sako, kad mes gauname terminą iš šio Urimo ir Thummim. Tiesą sakant, atgal originale tai nėra balsavimas prieš tam tikrą projektą ar idėją. Mes nežinome, kokie buvo Urimai ir Tumimai, tačiau Senojo Testamento laikais jie naudojo burtų metodą Dievo valiai nustatyti.<br/>Taigi čia mokiniai paima tą patį dalyką, kaip ir mesdami kauliukus, norėdami pamatyti, kuris iš dviejų draugų, kuriuos Dievas pasirinko pakeisti Judą Iskarijotą.<br/>Lotas krito Motiejui; jis buvo priskaičiuotas prie vienuolikos (Apd 1, 26).<br/>Dabar, kas pasaulyje yra Matthias? Niekas niekada apie jį negirdėjo prieš ar nuo jo. Bus įdomu susitikti su Matthiasu ir sužinoti, kas jis yra ir ką jis padarė. Manau, kad iš vėlesnės istorijos akivaizdu, kad Dievas pasirinko Paulių kaip apaštalą. Paulius pareiškia pats. Dabar tai yra paskutinis kartas, mes kada nors skaityti apie juos, siekiant atskirti Dievo valią liejimo daug ar atsitiktinai rūšies dalykas.<br/>Pažįstu bendražygį šiandien, siekiantį įžvelgti Viešpaties valią, jis melsis ir užduos Viešpačiui klausimą. Jis turės dešimt centų kišenėje, ir kai jis meldžiasi, jis ims centus užmerktomis akimis ir nuleis juos ant stalo, ir jei jie visi ateis galvas, tai taip. Įdomus dalykas yra tai, kad kaskart jie visi pakils aukštyn kojomis, ir tai yra gana geri šansai. Tačiau po to, kai buvo duota Šventoji Dvasia, mes nerandame jokio modelio. Kai tik Šventoji Dvasia nužengė ant bažnyčios, ji ėmė kalbėti jiems ir įsakė: „Paskirkite man Paulių ir Barnabą, kad tarnautų, kur aš juos pašaukiau“ (Apd 13, 2). Ir Šventoji Dvasia išsiuntė juos. Taigi mes rasti bažnyčią labiau tiesiogiai vadovaujasi Šventosios Dvasios. Kai Šventoji Dvasia atėjo, tai mesti kauliukus išsiaiškinti Dievo valią buvo atidėtas.<br/>"<br/><br/>Karaliaus Jokūbo versija<br/><br/>Tai yra 1769 m.

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Stalino opozicija partijoje, įskaitant Bukhariną, Yagodą ir Rykovą, buvo išvalyta šiuose parodomuosiuose teismo procesuose, nes Stalinas manipuliuodamas privertė juos prisipažinti dėl perversmo planavimo ir valstybės pasipriešinimo nusikaltimų, net jei nebuvo įrodymų. Gabor T Rittersporn sakė: "Daugelis aukų buvo nuoširdžiai atsidavę bolševikų principams." Tai sustiprina įrodymą, kad bolševikų idealai, kurie kažkada buvo komunistų partijos šaknys, buvo išardyti ir sunaikinti valytojų. Partija buvo išsekinta ir buvę nariai bejėgiškai stebėjo, kaip Stalinas naudoja didįjį valymą kaip įrankį transformuoti Rusiją iš vienos partijos valstybės į neginčijamą diktatūrą. Vėlgi, valymai sugriovė komunistų partijos, susiformavusios per bolševikų revoliuciją, struktūrą. Tai sutampa su šaltiniu „Stalin the Executor“, nes abu rodo manipuliacinį pobūdį, kuris padėjo diktatoriui sustiprinti savo sukibimą su Rusijos gerkle.<br/>Manipuliacinis būdas, kuriuo Stalinas apkaltino savo tikslinę opoziciją valymų metu, kasdienių rusų akyse taip pat turėjo implosyvų poveikį Sovietų visuomenei. Stalinas sugebėjo surinkti paramą iš žmonių, naudodamas propagandą ir žiniasklaidą, kad padėtų jam sukurti "asmenybės kultą" ir herojiško ir drąsaus lyderio įvaizdį. Per šią paramą Stalinas įskiepijo nepasitikėjimą žmonių protais, įtikindamas juos, kad revoliucijos išdavikai ir tai, ką jis apibūdino kaip "liaudies priešus", buvo tarp jų.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell yra nervų brawlers, o ne nervų žvaigždžių galias. Buvau 750 praėjusį sezoną su galia 8 nita ir tai yra labai sunku praeiti, kad, kaip, žvaigždės galios žaisti tikrai dominuojantį vaidmenį. Rungtynių taip pat yra šiukšlių. Kai aš žaidžiu perlas grab (apie 600 trofėjų), dažnai yra matchups, kur priešo komanda turi vieną žaidėją daugiau nei mes, kurie yra maxed ir tai net ne tai, kad mes turime lvl 9 konkuruoti su tuo. Kartais yra net matchups, kur priešo komanda yra visiškai maxi, ir nė vienas iš mūsų yra. Štai kodėl aš ne žaisti brawl žvaigždes rimtai nebėra. Tai net kaip nėra daug žaidėjų, kurie nėra maxi ir apie 600 trofėjų. Tai erzina.<br/>Redaguoti: Manau, kad superląstelė turėtų turėti bent pagrindinį mechanizmą, kuris nustato vidutinį brawlers lygį nustatant rungtynes.<br/><br/>Išskyrus trofėjus, kurie iš tikrųjų nenurodo jūsų įgūdžių. Jie nurodo komandos draugų, su kuriais esate, įgūdžius. Ir man gerai sekasi žaisti prieš aukštesnio lygio brawlers, bet kai viena komanda yra 10 lygio, o kita ne, akivaizdu, kad tai yra nesubalansuota.<br/><br/>Aš rekomenduoju gauti keletą gerų draugų žaisti su, aš ir 2 draugai gavo mano draugai galia 1 erkių rangas 28 žaisdami perlas patraukti su tam tikra kompozicija visą dieną ir mes padarėme jį be nė vienas iš mūsų yra maxed su mūsų brawlers.<br/><br/>Žinau, kaip jautiesi, kai turėjau brawlerių dideliuose trofėjus su žemu lygiu, ir sunku eiti toliau, ir viskas, ką aš sau sakiau "Aš noriu turėti žvaigždžių galias", tikrai supercell turi subalansuoti žvaigždžių galias arba bent jau padaryti geresnę piršlybų sistemą.<br/><br/>Jaučiu, kad tai. Aš ne taip gerai, kaip jūs, bet aš gavau "Emz" iki 500 galios 1 ir piršlybos buvo siaubingos. Visur maksimaliai išnaudojo žaidėjus! Ir tai nepadėjo, kad dauguma mano komandos draugų turėjo apie 5-8k trofėjus ... Turėjau griebtis solo pasirodymo paskutinę minutę, nes galiu arba pasalinti neįtariančius žaidėjus, arba tiesiog žaisti šiek tiek agresyviai tinkamu laiku. Bet aš tikrai norėčiau, kad tai būtų šiek tiek lengviau žmonėms, kurie nori stumti brawlers į tikrai didelius trofėjų diapazonus, neturėdami žvaigždžių galių prabangos.<br/><br/>Altho smaigalys vis dar geras be curveball. Curveball buvo tik pagalba pataikyti savo kadrus dažniau kaip smaigalys. Bet net prieš curveball buvo išleistas, smaigalys buvo tikrai stiprus brawler, todėl jis išliks tas pats dabar.<br/><br/>Sutinku, kad jie turėjo nervų pasalą, bet manau, kad jie bando subalansuoti tiek Snappy Sniping ir Ambush, nes jie abu susilieja su šiuo pakeitimu. Ji tapo šiek tiek galinga, bet vis dar nėra nervų verta<br/><br/>Aš nesu įsitikinęs, apie tai, bet dabar, kai Darryl gavo pastebimą buff, žiūri į savo naują statistiką, atrodo, kad Darryl gali užgožti Bull, nes ne tik jis visada gali spręsti daugiau žalos nei Bull, jis nemirs anksčiau, todėl jų išlikimas bus panašus be žvaigždės galios (nors Bull's išlikimas vis dar pastebimai geriau nei Darryl's Tough). Ne tik tai, kad Darryl super gali automatiškai regeneruoti, o tai reiškia, kad Darryl MIG gali būti veiksmingai žaidžiamas tiek kaip sunkiasvoris, tiek žudikas tuo pačiu metu (prieš tai, kai jis sucks kaip sunkusis, bet padorus kaip žudikas)<br/><br/>Bet jis pervertino af. Ir jūs gaunate trofėjus su juo labai lengvai. Taigi im kinda ok su nervu. Aš net grojo jį nuo tada, kai aš jį į 500 (maždaug prieš 5 mėnesius), todėl ne tai, kad man rūpi, kad taip pat.<br/><br/>Kodėl Poco / Penny negauna HP nervų, jei jie yra Marksman / Healer atitinkamai ne bakas?<br/>Kodėl Rozos tankumas nenervina, kosulys 70% sumažina žalą?<br/>Kodėl Tick leidžiama turėti aukščiausią diapazoną ir labiausiai nemokamą pokedamage visame žaidime?<br/>Kodėl Leonas negauna HP / Damage buff?<br/><br/>Kad ir kaip būtų, tai buvo "Ambush", kuris buvo OP, o ne "Base Piper". Norėčiau teigti, kad "Ambush" yra geriausia žvaigždė galia žaidime (dabar dar labiau, nes žalos padidėjimo procentas netiesiogiai padidėjo), o "Base Piper" buvo dugno-10 brawler.<br/><br/>Ką "Supercell" turėtų padaryti, yra atstatyti abu nervus, sumažinti "Ambush" iki 600 ir sumažinti "Snappy Sniping" iki 0,25, nes jį netiesiogiai sugadintų bazinė žala.<br/><br/>Taip, ir aš manau, kad jie nuėjo šiek tiek per toli su Rosa, nes dabar ji iš esmės yra geresnis bulius dabar, kai kalbama apie degalų papildymą, kurį ji jau kurį laiką. Dabar Darryl taip pat gali būti mažesnis, galingesnis bulius<br/><br/>Kodėl? Jaučiu, kad jai reikia beveik visko, išskyrus jos žvaigždės galią. Jos sveikata ir greitis daro ją šiek tiek sunkiau naudoti, nes ji gali mirti gana lengvai, ir jai tikrai sunku sugauti greitesnius brawlers, tokius kaip Crow. Jos žvaigždės galia yra šiek tiek sugadinta, nors... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Savarankiškas darbas 1 dalis<br/><br/>Kai priimate darbą bet kurioje organizacijoje, turite atlikti įvairius darbus pagal savo darbdavio reikalavimus ir galite gauti fiksuotą pajamų sumą kaip atlyginimą.
