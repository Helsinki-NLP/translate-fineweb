| What is charisma and how to develop it? How to distinguish a charismatic person from a charming one?<br/><br/>One Answer<br/><br/>A charming person is someone you like, and a charismatic person is someone who impresses you with their abilities. A pleasant – looking person standing on the sidelines can be charming but not charismatic, and a commander who manages an army can be charismatic but not charming. | Kas yra charizma ir kaip ją plėtoti? Kaip atskirti charizmatišką asmenį nuo žavingo?<br/><br/>Vienas atsakymas<br/><br/>Žavingas žmogus yra tas, kuris jums patinka, o charizmatiškas žmogus yra tas, kuris jus nustebina savo sugebėjimais. Malonus žmogus, stovintis už borto, gali būti žavingas, bet ne charizmatiškas, o vadas, valdantis kariuomenę, gali būti charizmatiškas, bet ne žavingas. |

| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Pavyzdžiui, Amerikos Konstitucijos VI straipsnio 2 punkte yra nuostatos, kad "visos sutartys ... yra aukščiausias šalies įstatymas". Nors akivaizdu, kad pačios sutartys neturi tokio paties poveikio kaip federaliniai įstatymai. Tiesą sakant, jie pradeda veikti tik tada, kai šios nuostatos įsigalioja kaip federalinis įstatymas su Senato ir prezidento patvirtinimu. Nors tai yra praktika, tai yra visuotinai pripažintas tarptautinės teisės principas, kad tam tikros sutartys turi privalomą poveikį šalims. Sutartis turi atitikti reikalavimą, kad ji turi būti savarankiškai įgyvendinama sutartis, kuri paveiktų šalį be tiesioginio atitinkamo vidaus teisės aktų leidėjo.<br/><br/>Dėl to kyla klausimas, kuri sutartis bus laikoma "savarankiškai vykdoma" ir kuri ne?<br/><br/>Ar sutartis yra savarankiškai įgyvendinama sutartis, ar ne, kiekvienu konkrečiu atveju sprendžia nacionaliniai teisėjai (Buergenthal, 1992). Norint tai suprasti, pirmiausia bus nagrinėjamos dviejų tipų teorijos, po kurių seka šalys apie sutarčių, taikomų vidaus teisei, pobūdį. Šios dvi teorijos yra monizmas ir dualizmas. Jie iš esmės žiūri į vidaus ir tarptautinės teisės sistemą kaip į vieną hierarchiją ir dvi atskiras hierarchijas (Wildhaber, 1971). Šalys po monizmo mano, kad tam tikros sutartys iš karto yra privalomos ir nedelsiant turi įtakos šaliai. Kai sutartis bus ratifikuota, ji gali būti remiamasi nacionaliniuose teismuose ir laikoma šalies teisės dalimi. Šalys, kurios laikosi dualizmo, mano, kad sutartis neturi įtakos vidaus teisei, kol ji nėra sustiprinta įstatymų leidėjo, priimto parlamente. Dualizmo pavyzdys yra tai, kaip Europos žmogaus teisių konvencija pradėjo veikti Jungtinėje Karalystėje po to, kai jos parlamente buvo priimtas 1998 m. Žmogaus teisių aktas (Įstatymai, 2000).<br/><br/>Tarptautinė teisė yra įvairi, taip pat skirtingos šalys laikosi sutarčių priėmimo procedūrų. Kai kurios konstitucijos pačios nurodo sutarties ratifikavimo procedūras. Kai kurios šalys netgi skirtingai vertina tarptautinę sutarčių teisę ir tarptautinę paprotinę teisę. Kai kurios tarptautinės organizacijos, pvz., Europos Sąjunga, dažnai veikia savo valstybių narių vidaus teisę. Europos Sąjungos valstybės narės turi įgyvendinti tam tikras Bendrijos teisės aktų leidybos formas, tačiau jos iš esmės skiriasi nuo savarankiškai įgyvendinančių sutarčių. Skirtumas tas, kad ne nacionaliniai teisėjai turi spręsti, ar nuostatos taikomos savarankiškai, ar ne, o Europos Teisingumo Teismas turi aiškinti jas pagal savo steigiamąsias sutartis. Kitos tarptautinės teisės formos, suformuotos rezoliucijų forma, šioms valstybėms gali neturėti tokio paties poveikio, tačiau jos gali jas laikyti „negriežtosios teisės“ formomis ir į jas žvelgti aiškinant teisės intencijas. Kartais tarptautinių organizacijų, tokių kaip Amerikos Žmogaus Teisių Teismas, teisminių organų pareiškimai turi įtakos jų valstybėms narėms. Nors šie pareiškimai nėra privalomi valstybėms narėms, atrodo, kad nacionaliniai teisėjai nurodo juos kaip autoritetingą aiškinimą.<br/><br/>Todėl analizuojant skirtingose šalyse nustatytas procedūras ir precedentus reikia atsižvelgti į kiekvieną atvejį atskirai. Siekiant išnagrinėti savarankiškai įgyvendinamų sutarčių sąvoką, šiame dokumente bus lyginami skirtingų jurisdikcijų nustatyti precedentai. Jei skaitytojas nori atlikti panašią analizę, jie gali tai padaryti, žiūrėdami į skirtingus nacionalinius tarptautinės teisės metraščius. Dažniausiai šiuose metraščiuose bus skyrius, skirtas tarptautinės ir nacionalinės teisės santykiams.<br/><br/>Tarptautinė jurisprudencija:<br/><br/>Svarbiausias klausimas, su kuriuo susiduria nacionaliniai teismai, yra tai, ar sutartis yra savarankiškai vykdoma? Jei sutartis gali būti taikoma be papildomo vidaus teisės aktų leidėjo, kuris ją sustiprintų. Šis klausimas kilo byloje Czesław S prieš Valstybės iždą ir Valstybės iždo ministrą, kurioje Lenkijos Konstitucinis Teismas konstatavo, kad, kadangi sutarties nuostatose kalbama apie vidaus priemones, kurių reikia imtis, sutartis nėra savaime vykdoma (bylos dėl Bugo upės, Czesław S prieš Valstybės iždą ir Valstybės iždo ministrą, 2003 m.). Iš esmės, kai Sutartyje kalbama apie vidaus priemones, kurių reikia imtis, ji pati savaime nesukuria naujų įsipareigojimų; priešingai, ji sustiprina Sutarties ketinimą, kad vidaus teisiniame procese būtų imtasi priemonių tam pačiam tikslui pasiekti. Panašus klausimas buvo iškeltas Sosa byloje Jungtinėse Amerikos Valstijose. Šiuo atveju teismas svarstė, ar Tarptautinis pilietinių ir politinių teisių paktas buvo savarankiškai vykdoma sutartis. Amerikos Aukščiausiasis Teismas taip pat paskelbė, kad Tarptautinis pilietinių ir politinių teisių paktas nėra savaime įgyvendinama sutartis (Teismas, 2004). Šveicarijos federalinis aukščiausiasis teismas taip pat nagrinėjo Tarptautinio pilietinių ir politinių teisių pakto savaiminio vykdymo pobūdį. Teismui buvo pateiktas klausimas, ar 13 straipsnio 2 dalies b ir c punktai buvo savaiminio vykdymo pobūdžio. Teismas nagrinėjo, ar sutartis iš dalies buvo savarankiškai vykdoma, ir tai padarė patikrindamas, ar yra minimalus pagrindinis sutarties turinys, kad ji būtų taikoma. Teismas nusprendė, kad Sutartyje tokios nuostatos nėra (A ir B prieš Ciuricho kantono vyriausybę, 2000 m.).<br/><br/>Svarbu suprasti, kad šie klausimai skiriasi nuo pagrindinio klausimo, ar tarptautinė teisė gali būti taikoma kaip žemės teisės dalis? Norint atsakyti į šį klausimą, straipsnyje bus nagrinėjamas Dominikos Respublikos Aukščiausiojo Teismo sprendimas. Aukščiausiasis Teismas konstatavo, kad Dominikos Respublikos Konstitucijos 3 straipsnis tarptautinę teisę padarė privalomą vidaus teisinei tvarkai. Teismas atmetė Aukštesniojo žemės teismo aiškinimą, kad šios sutartys yra „užsienio įstatymų leidžiamoji valdžia“, o ne vidaus teisinės sistemos dalis. Aukščiausiasis Teismas nustatė, kad visos Dominikos Respublikos ratifikuotos sutartys sudarė Dominikos teisės dalį ir todėl gali būti vadinamos savarankiškai vykdomomis (Gallardo Montilla prieš Gallardo Concepción ir kt., 1997). Šveicarijos federalinis aukščiausiasis teismas išnagrinėjo, ar Libsono sutartis buvo savarankiškai įgyvendinama ir tiesiogiai taikoma Šveicarijos universitetams. Pagal atitinkamą teismų praktiką sutarties norma yra tiesiogiai taikoma, jei jos turinys yra pakankamai tikslus ir aiškus, kad būtų galima priimti sprendimą konkrečioje byloje. Taigi norma turi būti įgyvendinama, t. y. ji turi apibrėžti individo teises bei pareigas ir būti nukreipta į kompetentingus autoritetus“ (X prieš Liucernos universitetą, 2014). Tai reiškia, kad tai, ar sutartis yra tiesiogiai taikoma, ar ne, priklauso nuo to, ar norma yra pagrįsta. Lisabonos sutartis grindžiama laive įgytos kvalifikacijos principu. Tai perteikiama sutarties IV straipsnio 1 dalyje. Taip buvo siekiama įpareigoti valstybes parodyti, kad jų sprendimų priėmimo procesas yra sąžiningas, skaidrus ir nediskriminacinis. Atsakomybė įrodyti, kad pareiškėjas neatitinka reikalaujamų kriterijų, tenka „vertinimą atliekančiai įstaigai“. Sutartimi užtikrinamos procedūrinės garantijos, kurios yra visuotinai pripažįstamos šalyse, todėl teismas nusprendė, kad ši sutartis yra savarankiškai vykdoma. Tai ir toliau rodo skirtingus aiškinimus, kurių ėmėsi įvairių šalių teismai.<br/><br/>Svarbu stebėti, ar iš tikrųjų laikomasi sutartyse nustatytų normų. Įvairių jurisdikcijų teismų praktika pabrėžė, kad nacionaliniai teismai yra galutiniai įgaliojimai sprendžiant klausimą, ar sutartis yra savarankiškai vykdoma. Taip pat yra neatskiriamas šalių įsipareigojimas laikytis sutarčių ir tinkamai jas vykdyti. Tokia yra Pacta Sunt Servanda taisyklė, įtvirtinta Vienos konvencijos dėl sutarčių teisės (VCLT) 26 straipsnyje. Be to, 27 straipsnyje teigiama, kad tarptautinės teisės įsipareigojimai negali būti ignoruojami kaip pateisinimas pasinaudojant vidaus teise. Daugelio šalių teismai, pvz., Latvijos Konstitucinis Teismas, tai naudojo kaip aiškinimo šaltinį. Tuo atveju, kai nacionalinė norma prieštarauja tarptautinei normai, teismas nusprendė, kad nacionalinė norma yra niekinė. Norėdamas padaryti išvadą, teismas tvirtai rėmėsi būtinu sutarčių vykdymu sąžiningai, kaip numatyta VKTST 26 straipsnyje (Linija prieš Latviją, 2004).<br/><br/>Išvada:<br/><br/>Iš to, kas išdėstyta pirmiau, aišku, kad sutartyse yra tam tikrų reikalavimų, kad jas būtų galima laikyti savarankiškai įgyvendinamomis, tačiau, neatsižvelgiant į visus šiuos reikalavimus, svarbiausias išlieka nacionalinių teismų aiškinimas. Nacionaliniai teismai nusprendžia, ar sutartį galima vadinti savaiminiu vykdymu, ar ne. Nors jų Konstitucijoje gali būti nuostata, kad sutarčių teisė yra aukščiausias žemės įstatymas, skirtingų šalių teismai šias nuostatas aiškina skirtingai. Tai galima matyti, kaip Amerikos ir Dominikos konstitucijose yra šios nuostatos, bet visiškai skirtingos jų interpretacijos. Sąvoka „savarankiškas vykdymas“ gali neatitikti šių sutarčių, nes praktikoje joms vis dar reikalingas nacionalinių teismų pritarimas. Būtų idealu, jei šalys pripažintų sutarčių savaiminį vykdymą ir su jomis elgtųsi taip, kad būtų paisoma Tarptautinio pilietinių ir politinių teisių pakto 26 ir 27 straipsnių. Vėlgi, tai yra „ideali“ situacija ir mažai tikėtina, kad netrukus pateks į tam tikrų jurisdikcijų valstybinę praktiką. Vis dėlto vilties galima tikėtis pažvelgus į nacionalinių teismų aiškinimus, kurie gerbia šias normas ir, tikėkimės, atvers kelią kitiems teismams tai pripažinti.<br/><br/>Nuorodos:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Už scenų tragedijos, kurios paveikė televizoriaus mirtiniausią laimikį<br/><br/>Sumažintos žvejybos kvotos<br/><br/>Nors "Deadliest Catch" įgula didžiąją dalį savo pinigų gauna iš "Discovery", tai nereiškia, kad jie iš tikrųjų neparduoda savo vilkimo. Taigi, galite pasakyti, kad jie turi du pajamų šaltinius, o tai yra kažkas, ko dauguma žmonių savo darbo linijoje neturi.<br/><br/>Tačiau 2017 m. Aliaskos žuvų ir žaidimų departamentas pradėjo kvotų sistemą, kuri perpus apribojo žuvų kiekį, kurį bet kuris žvejybos laivas galėtų sugrąžinti į krantą. Tai reiškia, kad "Deadliest Catch" įgula kelerius metus patyrė didžiulį pelno sumažėjimą. Ei, bent jau jie turi "Discovery", kad sumokėtų sąskaitas, tiesa? |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | DIENORAŠČIAI<br/><br/>Peržiūrėkite mūsų kolegų tinklaraščių kolekciją.<br/><br/>INFORMACINIAI DIENORAŠČIAI<br/><br/>Nespauskite jo<br/><br/>pagal<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Lapkritis 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stresas, nesvarbu, kaip dideli dalykai vyksta, jis visada gali rasti būdą, kaip pakelti savo negraži galvą. Nesvarbu, ar tai yra paskutinės minutės darbo prašymas, ar popierius, kurį pamiršote parašyti, ir tai yra kitą dieną, stresas visada gali rasti kelią į jūsų dieną, jei leisite. Šiandien aš jums parodysiu keletą dalykų, kuriuos galite padaryti, kad pašalintumėte ar išvengtumėte streso.<br/><br/>Pirmas dalykas, kurį galite padaryti, yra naudotis. Pratimai yra puikus būdas sumažinti stresą, nes jis sumažina streso hormono jūsų kūno žinomas kaip kortizolio. Kuo mažesnis kortizolio jūsų kūno, tuo mažesnis bus jūsų streso lygis. Pratimai taip pat gali padidinti jūsų pasitikėjimą, o kai jūsų pasitikėjimas yra iki tada jūsų stresas paprastai yra žemyn. Man, kai aš gauti pabrėžė, aš visada naudojasi vyksta į sporto salę ir praktika bokso, ji padeda man deginti kalorijas ir sumažinti stresą, o smagiai.<br/><br/>Rašymas dalykų žemyn buvo būdas nuraminti žmones labai ilgą laiką, ir tai yra kita tema mūsų sąraše. Rašymas žemyn, kas daro jums pabrėžė yra būdas išvalyti protą, ir tai padeda atsikratyti streso, taip pat. Panašią patirtį turiu rašydama istorijas, dažniausiai, jei negaliu galvoti apie naują idėją dėl senos, užrašysiu seną idėją ir pagalvosiu apie ją. Tai yra, kai naujos idėjos pradeda kilti ir aš galiu toliau rašyti normaliai. Tas pats pasakytina ir apie stresą. Pagalvokite apie srautą, jis ir toliau teka žemyn, kol jis pasiekia bebrų užtvanką, o ši užtvanka blokuoja vandens srautą ir viskas pradeda kauptis. Vienintelis būdas gauti vandens srautą atgal į normalią - pašalinti užtvanką. Štai kur rašymas ateina. Kai jį užrašote, jūs pašalinate streso gabalėlį, kol vėl galėsite galvoti normaliai.<br/><br/>Stresas gali ateiti į mūsų gyvenimą per duris mūsų gyvenime, kad mes nuolat atviras. Atidėliojimas yra būdas, kad mes galime palikti duris atviras stresas. Laukimas iki rytojaus gali būti įdomus šiandien, bet tai pakenks jums rytoj ir yra labai trumparegiškas sprendimas. Kuo ilgiau jūs laukiate, kad kažką darytumėte, tuo didesnis dalykas tampa, ir kuo didesnis jis tampa, tuo daugiau streso jūs pakviesite į savo gyvenimą. Rūpinimasis kažkuo kuo greičiau mes gauname tai puikus būdas užkirsti kelią stresui, bet tai yra kažkas, kad užima didelę drausmę daryti. Kuo daugiau jūs sumažinti vilkinimas iš savo gyvenimo, tuo daugiau streso nemokamai jums bus. Taigi, uždaryk duris, išleisi visą šaltą orą.<br/><br/>Taigi pažvelkime: Pratimai, užrašykite, kas jus pabrėžia, o ne atidėliokite. Tai tik keletas būdų, kaip sumažinti stresą, bet man jie yra efektyviausi. Nors žinau, kad tai gali neveikti visiems, norėčiau pakviesti visus, kurie jaučia stresą, ištirti, kaip atsikratyti. |
