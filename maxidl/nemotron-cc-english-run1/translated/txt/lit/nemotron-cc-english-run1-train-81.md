| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Prieš keturiasdešimt devynerius metus prezidentas Lyndon B. Johnson pasirašė 1965 m. Balsavimo teisių aktą.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Beveik prieš šimtmetį 15-oji Konstitucijos pataisa skelbė: „JAV piliečių teisės balsuoti negali būti atimtos ar apribotos dėl rasės, odos spalvos ar ankstesnės vergovės būklės“. Ir beveik šimtmetį prieš tai mūsų tautos įkūrėjai pradėjo didįjį Amerikos demokratijos eksperimentą, paskelbdami, kad „visi žmonės yra sukurti lygūs“.<br/><br/>1965 m. Balsavimo teisių aktas buvo pavėluotas pripažinimas, kad net Amerikoje mūsų pamatiniai idealai turi mažai svorio, jei jų negina teisinė valstybė. Štai kodėl 15-osios pataisos 2 skirsnis suteikė Kongresui „įgaliojimą įgyvendinti šį straipsnį atitinkamais teisės aktais“.<br/><br/>Ir iš tiesų, balsavimo teisių akto kodifikuota kalba galėjo pasiekti tai, ko negalėjo Rekonstrukcijos eros kongresas ir Thomas Jefferson. 1964 m. Pilietinių teisių aktas ir Balsavimo teisių aktas bei pilietinių teisių judėjimas, iš kurio jie atsirado, buvo katalizatorius, padėjęs dramatiškai padidinti juodaodžių amerikiečių galimybę dalyvauti demokratiniame procese.<br/><br/>Pavyzdžiui, tik 6,7 procentai reikalavimus atitinkančių juodųjų Misisipės gyventojų buvo užregistruoti balsuoti nuo 1962 m. Iki 1969 m. Šis skaičius siekė 66,5 procento. Šiandien Misisipėje yra daugiau juodaodžių išrinktų pareigūnų nei bet kuri kita valstybė.<br/><br/>Balsavimo teisių akto nustatytos apsaugos priemonės buvo seniai pavėluotos, kai jos buvo priimtos, atspindinčios sunkią kovą, su kuria jos buvo pasiektos. Tačiau neįsivaizduojama, kad šios apsaugos dabar yra puolamos, keliančios pavojų pažangai, kurią mūsų tauta taip sunkiai dirbo.<br/><br/>Praėjusiais metais Shelby apygardos prieš turėtoją byloje JAV Aukščiausiasis Teismas išskerdė pagrindinį balsavimo teisių akto komponentą, kuris leido federalinei peržiūrai užtikrinti nediskriminavimą prieš įsigaliojant bet kokiam naujam balsavimo įstatymui.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Deja, respublikonų lyderių atsakas buvo nieko nedaryti. Senatorius Tedas Cruzas ir gubernatorius Rickas Perry išėjo iš savo kelio, kad pagirtų Aukščiausiojo Teismo sprendimą. Senatorius Randas Paulas (Randas Polas) atmetė balsavimo teisių akto būtinybę, sakydamas: „Mes turime afroamerikiečių prezidentą“.<br/><br/>Nors prezidento Baracko Obamos išrinkimas iš tiesų buvo istorinis įvykis, pavojinga manyti, kad jis atleidžia mus nuo budrumo dėl ilgalaikių mūsų tautos praeities pasekmių. Skuba, su kuria valstybės persikėlė priimti balsavimo apribojimus, yra patvirtinimas, kad 4 skirsnyje nustatytos apsaugos priemonės vis dar reikalingos.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Respublikonų gubernatoriai pasirašė griežtus fotoidentifikavimo apribojimus įstatymui, kaip sprendimą praktiškai neegzistuojančiai rinkėjų apsimetimo problemai, neproporcingai kenkiančiai moterims, jaunimui, dirbančioms šeimoms ir afroamerikiečių bendruomenei. Respublikonams, tokiems kaip Paulius, neprotinga siekti šių bendruomenių balsų, kai jie mano, kad „nėra nieko blogo“ nustatyti apribojimus, dėl kurių šioms rinkimų apygardoms sunkiau balsuoti.<br/><br/>Respublikonai taip pat siekė apriboti ankstyvo balsavimo laikotarpius, įskaitant sekmadienį prieš rinkimų dieną, kai afroamerikiečių bažnyčios turėjo didelę sėkmę su Souls į apklausų programas.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Šie suvaržymai yra įžūlios respublikonų pastangos apsunkinti balsavimą, remiantis siaurais trumpalaikiais politiniais skaičiavimais, kad respublikonai gali laimėti rinkimus mažindami rinkėjų skaičių.<br/><br/>Demokratai turi labai skirtingą misiją, kai kalbama apie balsavimą: užtikrinti, kad kiekvienas tinkamas rinkėjas galėtų užsiregistruoti, kad kiekvienas registruotas rinkėjas galėtų balsuoti ir kad kiekvienas balsas būtų tiksliai suskaičiuotas.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Demokratų nacionalinio komiteto rinkimų plėtros projektas atspindi mūsų įsitikinimą, kad didesnis rinkėjų dalyvavimas stiprina mūsų tautą ir demokratiją. Mes ir toliau naudosime savo neprilygstamas institucines žinias, kad apsaugotume balsavimo teises nuo teisės aktų ir taktikos, kuri bandytų nuslopinti balsavimą. Ir kadangi geriausia gynyba yra geras nusikaltimas, mes taip pat stengiamės išplėsti balsavimą, panaudodami savo technologijas ir duomenų išteklius naujų rinkėjų registravimui.<br/><br/>Šiomis metinėmis vienas iš geriausių būdų pagerbti tuos, kurie kovojo ir kai kuriais atvejais atidavė savo gyvybes, nes įstatymo ištrauka yra respublikonai Kongrese prisijungti prie demokratų priimant balsavimo teisių pakeitimo aktą, kad būtų atkurtas 1965 m. Balsavimo teisių akto pažadas.<br/><br/>Reklama<br/><br/>Demokratė Debbie Wasserman Schultz atstovauja Floridos 23-iajai Kongreso apygardai JAV Kongrese. Nuo 2011 m.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Klausimai ir atsakymai: Vatikano apsaugos ekspertas dr. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>2021 m. birželio 13 d.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Atvaizdas: Australijos jėzuitai.<br/><br/>Grigaliaus universiteto Romoje Vaikų apsaugos centro prezidentas ir Popiežiškosios nepilnamečių apsaugos komisijos narys pontifikas Hansas Zollneris SJ 2018 m. buvo Australijoje, kad pasikalbėtų su katalikų ministerijų vadovais ir išgyvenusiaisiais.<br/><br/>Michaelas McVeigh iš jėzuitų komunikacijų grupės susėdo su juo per vizitą, kad ištirtų, kaip Bažnyčia reaguoja į piktnaudžiavimo krizę tarptautiniu mastu ir ko galima pasimokyti iš mūsų patirties Australijoje.<br/><br/>MM: Tai trečioji jūsų kelionė į Australiją. Jūs aplankėte nemažai kitų šalių, kad pamatytumėte, kaip Bažnyčia reaguoja į piktnaudžiavimą visame pasaulyje. Ar galite pateikti mums idėją, kaip atrodo pasaulio vaizdas?<br/><br/>Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Aplankęs apie 50 šalių penkiuose ar šešiuose žemynuose, suprantu, kad Bažnyčia per pastaruosius porą metų iš tiesų pradeda judėti link teisingumo nukentėjusiesiems, įsiklausymo į juos ir bet kokių galimų veiksmų, susijusių su apsauga, link.<br/><br/>Balandžio mėn. pabaigoje buvau su jėzuitų provincijomis iš visos Afrikos, o Afrikos ir Madagaskaro jėzuitų padėjėjo pirmininkas yra labai atsidavęs ir atsidavęs šiam darbui. Jis parengišsamų veiksmų planą, skirtą mokymui ir gairių nustatymui visoje vietoje. Tai labai dėmesingos ir labai apgalvotos pastangos padaryti viską, ką galima padaryti, kad aktyviai įsitrauktų į jėzuitų veiklą Afrikoje - žemyne, kur dar prieš kelerius metus visa tai buvo užsienio kalba.<br/><br/>Vienas iš iššūkių, bandant sukurti šį visuotinį požiūrį, yra tai, kad jūs susiduriate su tiek daug kultūrų ir tiek daug skirtingų supratimų. Kaip jūs tai sujungsite ir stengsitės mokyti ir remti religines bendruomenes, sprendžiančias šiuos klausimus?<br/><br/>Manau, kad galiu paskatinti diskusiją, paskatinti apmąstymus ir kuo geriau parengti žmones, kad jie galėtų atlikti parengiamąjį darbą.<br/><br/>Grigaliaus universiteto Vaikų apsaugos centras neapsimetinėja, kad turi atsakymą į kiekvieną klausimą. Ne tik todėl, kad mes nežinome konkrečių kontekstų - mes galbūt žinome keletą iš jų, bet mes kalbame apie tūkstančius kultūrų, mes kalbame apie šimtus kalbų, mes kalbame apie labai skirtingus teisinius pagrindus. Tai netgi kartais skiriasi vienoje šalyje, pavyzdžiui, Australijoje, kur Australijos Sandraugos valstybės turi skirtingus įstatymus nei kitos valstybės.<br/><br/>Aš esu kažkas, kas bando sukelti ir skatinti diskusijas ir apmąstymus. Aš taip pat labai džiaugiuosi klausydamasis žmonių.<br/><br/>Jūs paminėjote poreikį išklausyti ir palaikyti aukas, kad jos būtų išklausytos. Akivaizdu, kad mes turėjome Karališkąją komisiją čia, Australijoje, bet kokie yra kai kurie kiti būdai, kuriuos matėte, kad aukų balsai yra palaikomi visame pasaulyje?<br/><br/>Prancūzijoje yra viena vyskupija, įkūrusi tai, ką jie vadina "klausymo erdve". Ten aukos gali ateiti ir išreikšti save. Vyskupas yra čia. Tai atvira erdvė, kurioje žmonės, kurie buvo nepaprastai sužeisti, yra laisvi bent jau išreikšti tai, ko jie nori iš Bažnyčios vadovybės ir t.t.<br/><br/>Yra ir kitų vietų Jungtinėse Valstijose ar kitose šalyse, kur aukos buvo pakviestos vyskupijų, provincijų, Bažnyčios vadovybės. Turiu pasakyti, kad apskritai manau, jog yra gera valia, ir yra daugiau žmonių, tokių kaip vyskupai ir provincialai, kurie klausosi aukų, nei mes žinome. Tačiau nėra nė vieno modelio, pagal kurį aukoms būtų suteikta erdvė ne tik išreikšti save ir būti išklausytoms, bet ir aktyviai dalyvauti Bažnyčios vystymesi.<br/><br/>Kalbant apie paramos aukoms erdvių kūrimą, kokie yra kai kurie dalykai, kuriuos matėte, kurie tikrai galėtų padėti - ir kuriuos galėtume apsvarstyti čia, Australijoje?<br/><br/>Vienas iš pagrindinių dalykų, kuriuos nurodo daugelis aukų, yra: "Ar mes parapijos aplinkoje, mokyklų aplinkoje negalime turėti reguliaraus pokalbio, kuriame dalyvauja piktnaudžiavimo išgyvenę asmenys, kaip nuolatiniai komiteto, komisijos, apklausos tarybos, grįžtamojo ryšio grupės nariai ar kažkas panašaus?" Taigi, šis balsas yra ne tik įvedamas į konkrečią progą, arba kai žmogus jaučiasi, kad jis ar ji yra tokioje vietoje, kad galėtų kalbėti apie tai, bet ir reguliariai [išgirsta] - įdėkite tą balsą į sistemą.<br/><br/>Tai padės mums visiems. Tai padės išgyvenusiems ir aukoms, nes jie jausis laukiami ir vertinami konkrečioje patirtyje ir specifiniuose gyvenimo iššūkiuose, kuriuos jie išgyveno. Antra, tai padės visai bendruomenei, nes galime bent jau vis jautriau atsiliepti į išgyvenusiųjų rūpesčius ir ypatingus poreikius, kurie taip pat gali atsiliepti į jaunimo poreikius.<br/><br/>M: Mes turime stiprias išgyvenusiųjų grupes čia, Australijoje, kurios sugebėjo palaikyti viena kitą per šį procesą. Bet jūs sakote, kad mums reikia tam tikro būdo remti tas grupes ir remti tuos žmones per mūsų pačių institucijas?<br/><br/>Ir manau, kad turime būti kūrybingi. Tai vienu būdu dirbs vienai mokyklai, vienai parapijai ir vienai vyskupijai, o kitiems - kitu būdu. Kadangi išgyvenusieji, su kuriais aš nuolat bendrauju, turi gana panašių prašymų ir panašių patirčių, susijusių su priėmimu Bažnyčioje ar ne – jaučiasi išmesti ar atleisti. Bet jie taip pat turi skirtingus lūkesčius, taigi aš sužinojau, kad jūs taip pat turite labai greitai priimti skirtumus tarp to, ko nori ši konkreti grupė, ar šis konkretus išgyvenęs žmogus, prašymai ir poreikiai.<br/><br/>M: Išgyvenusieji kalba apie norą, kad jų pasakojimai būtų išgirsti ir pripažinti. Mes turėjome Karališkąją komisiją čia, Australijoje, kuri suteikė nepriklausomą procesą, kuriame aukos galėjo ateiti į priekį. Ar yra tokio dalyko kaip tiesa, teisingumas ir susitaikymo procesas poreikis Bažnyčiai tarptautiniu mastu?<br/><br/>H: Taip, manau, kad to reikia tarptautiniu mastu. Bet manau, kad pirmiausia kiekviena vietinė bažnyčia turi atlikti savo namų darbus. Nemanau, kad labai greitai įvyktų tai, jog būtų įsteigtas koks nors toks susirinkimas ar komisija, kurie nagrinėtų šią sritį visai Bažnyčiai. Bažnyčia vienija 1,3 milijardo žmonių, ji veikia 190 šalių, tačiau jos lūkesčiai dėl psichologinės, dvasinės ir finansinės paramos labai skiriasi.<br/><br/>Vienas dalykas, su kuriuo susidūriau nuolat bendraudamas su aukomis, dirbdamas su jomis ir jų klausydamasis, yra tai, kad jos nori būti išklausytos. Taigi, jei būtų jausmas, kad aukos buvo nuolat išklausomos - Romoje ir kitur - manau, kad tai suteiktų didelį palengvėjimą daugeliui aukų.<br/><br/>„Manau, kad [popiežiaus Pranciškaus] rūpestis, ypač dėl jūsų klausimo, yra tas, kad vietinės bažnyčios daro viską, ką gali, kad aukos būtų išklausytos toje konkrečioje šalyje. Turiu sąrašą žmonių, kurie nori kalbėtis su Šventuoju Tėvu tiesiogiai, o fiziškai tai neįmanoma. Aš buvau ten 2014 m., Kad galėčiau išversti du vokiečių maitintojo netekusius asmenis, kurie buvo pasirinkti su dviem airiais ir dviem anglų maitintojo netekusiais asmenimis, kai jis gavo šešis iš jų namuose. Jis paėmė visą rytą, klausydamasis jų vienas po kito. Kiekvienam jis buvo ten 40-45 minutes. Jei jis tai padarė kiekvienam išgyvenusiam, jis nebegalėjo užmigti.<br/><br/>Jo pavyzdys yra pavyzdys visai Katalikų Bažnyčiai, kaip aukos ir išgyvenusieji yra priimami, priimami ir išklausomi. Manau, kad jei vyskupai ir provincialai šiame pasaulyje, visose šalyse, sektų jo pavyzdžiu, daugelis išlikusiųjų tai tikrai vertintų.<br/><br/>Arkivyskupas Diarmudas Martinas prieš pat Pasaulinį šeimų susitikimą buvo pacituotas apie Popiežiškąją komisiją, sakiusią, kad ji yra per maža, kad pasiektų tai, ko reikia. Ar Bažnyčia turi skirti daugiau išteklių tam, kaip ji prižiūri šiuos klausimus?<br/><br/>Šiuo metu mes esame 16 narių iš beveik visų žemynų ir pagrindinių kalbų grupių. Mes atstovaujame įvairioms disciplinoms ir profesijoms, o komisijos tikslas – kaip ką tik paskelbti valstybės įstatai – yra patarti Šventajam Tėvui.<br/><br/>Bendras nesusipratimas dėl komisijos pirmiausia yra tai, kad mes nagrinėjame įtarimų atvejus. Mes neturime jokių teisinių ar administracinių galių bylose, nes, kai kalbama apie įtarimus piktnaudžiavimu, yra nustatyti teismai ir procedūra.<br/><br/>Antras nesusipratimas yra tas, kad mes tiesiogiai reklamuojame dalykus vietoje. Mūsų pirmasis ir svarbiausias tikslas yra, kad mes patartume Šventajam Tėvui klausimais.<br/><br/>Taigi, mano nuomone, taip, turime daugiau investuoti. Tačiau turime daugiau investuoti vietos lygmeniu ir užtikrinti, kad Popiežiškosios komisijos pasiūlymai būtų perduoti Šventajam Tėvui, o tai paprastai daro Prezidentas, ir tada būtų vykdomas tolesnis procesas, atspindintis tai, ką davėme kaip savo patarimą.<br/><br/>Australijoje Katalikų Profesionalų Standards Limited prižiūri Bažnyčios atsaką ir teikia gaires bei paramą užtikrinant, kad visos Bažnyčios institucijos būtų saugios vaikams. Ar reikia kokios nors organizacinės paramos iš Romos tiems vyskupams ir vyskupijoms, kurie stengiasi kurti šias institucijas ir užtikrinti apsaugą tose vyskupijose?<br/><br/>Manau, kad Komisija galiausiai vystysis šia linkme, nes dabar jie samdo ekspertus šiose srityse.<br/><br/>Manau, kad Bažnyčia turi suprasti, jog vietinės bažnyčios gali viena iš kitos mokytis, ir mano supratimas visada buvo toks – ir manau, kad Šventasis Tėvas mums priminė – kad Bažnyčia neveiks kaip centralizuota korporacija. Iš tikrųjų tai neveikia. Kiekvienas vyskupas, kiekviena vyskupų konferencija tam tikru mastu turi savo gyvenimą. Mums reikia daugiau sužinoti apie tai, kaip atverti abipusio bendravimo kanalus.<br/><br/>Yra keletas dalykų, kuriuos žmonės kaltina dėl piktnaudžiavimo Bažnyčioje. Kaip kunigas ir psichologas, ir kaip kažkas, kas susitiko ir dirbo su maitintojo netekusiais asmenimis, kokios yra jūsų mintys šiuo klausimu?<br/><br/>Manau, kad klausimas, iš kur atsiranda piktnaudžiavimas, yra svarbiausias, ir popiežius į tai atkreipė dėmesį savo rugpjūčio 20 d. paskelbtame laiške Dievo tautai. Pirmoje pastraipoje jis sako ir nuolat kartoja, kad seksualinio išnaudojimo klausimas visada – arba beveik visada – yra susijęs ne tik su piktnaudžiavimu valdžia, bet ir su piktnaudžiavimu sąžine.<br/><br/>Taigi tikrasis fundamentalus piktnaudžiavimo klausimas yra daug sudėtingesnis nei vien tik seksualumo klausimas – ar tai būtų heteroseksualumas, ar homoseksualumas. Tai galios klausimas, ir čia mes turime iš tikrųjų dirbti su klausimu, kaip mes suprantame kunigystę, kaip mes suprantame vyskupystę, kaip mes suprantame ir gyvename savo tarnystes? Kokios yra ribos?<br/><br/>Štai kodėl aš labai džiaugiuosi, kad jėzuitų provincija Australijoje kuria Elgesio kodeksą, nes mes kalbame ne tik apie seksualinį nepilnamečių išnaudojimą. Mes kalbame apie seksualinę prievartą prieš suaugusiuosius, ir mes kalbame apie prievartą kitais būdais, tokiais kaip piktnaudžiavimas sąžine, kai jūs diktuojate kažkam, ką manote, arba jūs apsimetate, kad žinote Dievą, ir jūs galite pasakyti kitam asmeniui, "Jūs turite tai padaryti", prieš to asmens sąžinę.<br/><br/>Daugelis žmonių mano, kad celibatas sukelia piktnaudžiavimą. Kaip visada sakau, celibatas pats savaime nėra piktnaudžiavimo priežastis, kitaip kaip mes paaiškinsime, kad 99,9 procentai visų smurtautojų negyvena celibato, ir kaip mes paaiškinsime, kad 95 ar 96 procentai visų kunigų nepiktnaudžiauja nepilnamečiais? Bet celibatas, arba skaistybės įžadas, kuris iš tikrųjų nėra integruotas, kuris iš tikrųjų nėra tinkamai įgyvendinamas – taip, tai sukelia problemą. Kartais žmonės imasi gerti, kartais jie imasi azartinių lošimų, o kartais jie imasi seksualinio netinkamo elgesio, su suaugusiais ir nepilnamečiais.<br/><br/>Tikrasis klausimas šiuo klausimu yra, kaip mes elgiamės su religinės dvasinės galios, su kuria kunigai ir vyskupai yra investuojami, sąvoka? Kaip teologija gali padėti mums suprasti, ir galbūt kaip sociologija, psichologija ar verslo administravimas gali padėti mums apibrėžti galios ribas ir būtinybę išlaikyti savo ribas. |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Tiesą sakant, net norėčiau pasakyti, kad tai nėra kažkas, kas kada nors pasikeis, taip pat neturėtume visi skubėti jį pakeisti. Po 10 metų mes vis dar turėsime kraujavimo kraštą, sudėtingus elementus didžiausių rūpesčių sąraše, o dalykai, kuriuos mes pagaliau suprasime, bus pagrindinės mūsų išlaidų dalys.<br/><br/>Dabar Gunnar ir Andy abu turi puikių taškų, ypač apie IT komandas, kurios mato IT problemas ir jas sprendžia IT sprendimais; iš tikrųjų, aš esu įsitikinęs, kad jų taškai turi nuopelnus.<br/><br/>Bet aš manau, kad yra ir kitų idėjų, kad koziris tuos (aš pakomentavo savo dienoraščių apie tai, ir vėliau nusprendė aš tiesiog turėtų dienoraštį čia). Tie viršų 3 rūpesčiai yra kraugeriškai nauja, pavyzdžiui, kad:<br/><br/>Mes bijome naujų dalykų, nes mes jų nesuprantame, arba mes jų nesuprantame, nes jie yra nauji.<br/><br/>Jie yra per daug nauji, kad turėtume tvirtą požiūrį į jų tvarkymą.<br/><br/>jie per daug nauji, kad žinotume, ar turėtume nerimauti, ar ne! mes linkę į nutylėjimą į paranojišką / nerimą, kuris yra geras!<br/><br/>pernelyg nauja, kad jiems būtų priskirti akivaizdūs biudžeto elementai. Ar galiu nusipirkti dėžutę ar tam tikrą programinę įrangą, kuri užtikrina „debesų saugumą“ arba „socialinės žiniasklaidos saugumą“?<br/><br/>jie yra tokie nauji, kad verslas net nežino, kaip juos naudoti ar ko jie nori iš jų. Jau nekalbant apie tai, kaip mes galime juos apsaugoti, o dar susitikti ar bent jau ne stomping per visus verslo poreikius. Jei verslas dar net nežino, kaip juos naudoti, aš nesu įsitikinęs, kad saugumas gali saugiai valdyti šį naudojimą.<br/><br/>Taip pat reikėtų paminėti, kad šie nauji dalykai yra iš esmės stumiami per vartotojišką šalį ir į verslą, su IT kaip "Oh yeah" minties natūra. Užkardos, AV, AM, Auth yra visi IT atsakymai į tipiškas IT problemas. Žinoma, yra skirtumas. Jie taip pat yra labai subjektyvūs klausimai, o ne labai objektyvūs daiktai, tokie kaip ugniasienės, žinomi kenkėjiški bitai, elgesys, parašai, prievadai. Verslas pateikia labai sudėtingus klausimus, kurie dažnai apima žmones (kurių mes negalime pataisyti) ir kurie dažnai netelpa į bendras taisykles. Net jei mes nusigręžėme nuo techninių sprendimų ir skyrėme savo laiką šių problemų sprendimui, jos vis tiek nebus tinkamai išspręstos. Panašiai, kai atsiranda stumdymas, ar galite turėti ir pasiekti tikslus su ugniasienėmis? Ar galite parodyti tobulėjimą? Visa tai kyla iš gana subjektyvaus ne techninio šių klausimų aspekto. Skirtumo tarp vaiko ataskaitos kortelės ir grįžtamojo ryšio, kurį gaunate iš tėvų-mokytojų konferencijos. Jei turite vaiką, kuris iš jų būtų labiausiai linkęs nesutikti ar nebūtinai tikėti? (Atsakymas yra subjektyvus!)<br/><br/>Galima sakyti, kad tai yra natūralus saugumo ir technologijų progresas: nuo techninių kontrolės priemonių įtvirtinimo iki kamino perkėlimo į elgesį ir žmones. Žinoma, šie 3 pagrindiniai rūpesčiai gali būti pasakyti, kad persmeigti per ugniasienes ir tinklo segmentus, tačiau tai yra tų dalykų pobūdis (socialinės žiniasklaidos "perforavimas" per ugniasienę yra daug kitoks nei aš perforavimas per SSH ryšį, kad galėčiau susieti savo namų tinklą; socialinė žiniasklaida yra panaši į * kelią * Aš naudoju savo SSH ryšį po to, kai sulaikymas jau yra perforuotas, nes jis reikalingas; ty. socialinės žiniasklaidos<br/><br/>Iš esmės, visi požymiai rodo, kad ši dichotomija nenustebino. Ir nemanau, kad tai yra dar vienas požymis, kad IT / saugumas daro tai neteisingai, arba nėra tinkamai suderintas su verslu, arba turi techninį tamsią serverio kambario foną. Aš nesakau, kad mes darome dalykus teisingai ar mes esame tinkamai suderinti, bet aukščiau nėra geras argumentas paremti šių trūkumų teoriją.<br/><br/>Dabar tikrai didelis šuolis. Norėčiau, kad dabartinis mobiliųjų kompiuterių augimas būtų toks pat didelis, kaip kompiuterių įvedimas į verslą, o vėliau - kompiuteris / internetas į verslą. Nebuvau, kai įvyko pirmasis, taip pat nebuvau pramonėje, kai asmeninių kompiuterių revoliucija įsiveržė į verslą, bet norėčiau lažintis, kad tai yra arčiausiai palyginimas iki šiol. Aš netgi galiu pasakyti tą patį apie socialinę žiniasklaidą. Tai yra prakeiktas naujas ir jie yra dideli pokyčiai, o ne tik "Mac" ar naujos programinės įrangos ar tam tikro naujo verslo proceso. |
