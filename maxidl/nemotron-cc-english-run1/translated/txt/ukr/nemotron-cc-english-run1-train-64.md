| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Сміт Чак - Через Біблію Серія C2000Ми звернемося до книги Дії, глава перша, як ми починаємо наше вивчення ранньої церкви.<br/>Лука, автор книги Дії, сподвижник апостола Павла, який також був автором Євангелія від Луки, написав ці два трактати другу, Теофілу. Теофіл — грецьке ім'я. це ім'я, яке має прекрасне значення. Ім'я означає любити Бога. Є деякі, які вірять, що це була зовсім не людина, але що Євангеліє і книга Дії були звернені до любителів Бога, ким би ви не були. Є й інші перекази, які говорять, що Теофіл був насправді господарем Луки. що в ті часи лікарі були рабами, як правило, рабом багатого покровителя. Отже, паном Луки був Теофіл, і він відпустив Луку, щоб бути з Павлом у місіонерських подорожах. Таким чином, Лука пише назад до свого колишнього пана. Це рання традиція церкви, але це, звичайно, неможливо довести, як і багато інших традицій.<br/>Є також ті, хто вірить, що коли Павло був у Троаді, і він отримав видіння людини, яка кличе до нього, кажучи: "Прийди до Македонії і допоможи нам", що той чоловік у видінні Павла був не хто інший, як Лука. Бо першим, з яким Павло дійсно зустрівся, коли прийшов до Македонії, був Лука. І як ми знаходимося в книзі Дії, ви побачите, що, коли ми потрапимо до цієї частини книги Дії, Лука починає писати більше від першої особи, а не від третьої особи. Отже, очевидно, саме в цей момент в Діяннях Апостолів Лука став супутником Павла і почав подорожувати з ним. Він почав використовувати займенники «ми» і «ми» замість «вони» і «вони». Це, без сумніву, де Люк став учасником і очевидцем тих речей, які відбувалися з цього моменту. Ми повідомимо вам про це, коли ми дійдемо до цієї точки.<br/>Він починає Дії Апостолів, зв'язавши його з Євангелієм від Луки. Цікаво, що останнє, що Лука записує в своєму Євангелії, - це перше, що він записує в Діяннях Апостолів. Ми знаходимо, що Євангеліє від Луки закривається, коли Ісус говорить Своїм учням чекати в Єрусалимі, поки вони не будуть наділені силою з висоти. А потім Ісус вознісся на небо, і так він закриває Євангеліє. Відкриваючи Дії Апостолів, він пише:<br/>Колишній трактат [тобто Євангеліє від Луки,] я написав вам, Теофіль, про все, що Ісус почав робити і навчати (Дії 1:1),<br/>Ключове слово почалося. Євангеліє від Луки не є повною історією служіння Ісуса Христа. Це тільки початок служіння Ісуса Христа. Ісус продовжує служити потребам людей. Ісус продовжує зціляти хворих. Ісус продовжує воскрешати мертвих. Ісус продовжує служити Своїй любові та Євангелії світу, тільки тепер Він служить через тих учнів, які були помазані Його Святим Духом. Але служіння Христа триває; в основному, це передумова, яку Лука приймає в Діяннях апостолів. Колишній трактат про все, що Ісус почав, як робити, так і навчати.<br/>Через це Дії Апостолів є незакінченою книгою, в якій Господь сьогодні продовжує працювати через життя тих, хто присвятив себе Божим знаряддям. Для того, щоб бути керовані і керовані і помазані Його Святим Духом, продовжувати служіння Ісуса в світі сьогодні. Тепер Бог визначив, що Його робота повинна бути виконана за допомогою людських інструментів. Я не кажу, що це повинно бути виконано. Бог може використовувати ангельські істоти для Своєї роботи, і прийде час, під час книги Об’явлення, коли Бог буде використовувати ангелів для проголошення Свого Євангелія людям по всьому світу. Об’явлення, розділ 14, «Перший ангел, що летить посеред неба, маючи вічне Євангеліє» (Об’явлення 14:6). Але в даний час Бог вирішив використовувати людські інструменти. Як би недосконалими вони не були, але це те, що Бог призначив використовувати. Захоплює те, що Бог буде використовувати мене, і Бог буде використовувати вас. Так багато разів, ми благаємо: "Господи, я не можу говорити. Я ніколи не міг говорити раніше або навіть зараз, Господи." Як Мойсей намагався відмовлятися від заклику Бога. Єремія сказав: "Господи, я просто дитина, ніхто не збирається слухати мене." І у всіх нас є свої виправдання, чому ми не можемо бути використані. Чи не так? Ми всі знаємо причини, чому Бог не міг використовувати нас.<br/>Одного разу, коли Господь закликав пророка виконувати Його діло, Він сказав: «Господи, пошли, кого хочеш». Господь сказав: «Гей, Я покликав тебе». Так часто ми знаходимося в такому положенні: "Господи, посилай рукою кого захочеш, нікого, крім мене, Господи." І все ж, Бог призначив використовувати нас.<br/>Тепер, кожен з нас може показати наші власні недосконалості. Кожен з нас може вказати на наші власні нездатності, і кожен з нас може знайти виправдання, чому Бог не хотів би використовувати мене. Але все ж, Бог вирішив використовувати вас. Щоб через ваше життя Він міг відкрити Себе нужденному світу. Ви дивуєтеся, коли Бог має такі інструменти, щоб використовувати, як Він коли-небудь зробив роботу, чи не так?<br/>До дня, коли Він був узятий, Він через Святого Духа дав заповіді апостолам, яких Він вибрав (Дії 1:2):<br/>Це те, чим він закінчив Євангеліє від Луки. День, коли Ісус був піднятий, після того, як Він сказав апостолам чекати дарування влади.<br/>Який також [тобто апостолів Він] виявив їм живим після своєї пристрасті [або смерті] багатьма непогрішними доказами (Дії 1:3).<br/>Важко заперечити факт воскресіння Ісуса Христа. Мене розважала, а також дратувала і дратувала стаття, яку я прочитав у Реєстрі Санта-Ана в минулу суботу. Про науку про творіння та еволюційні теорії, представлені в школах округу. Як це, один професор сказав, що він викладає науку клас, і, таким чином, вони мають справу тільки з фактами, і що у них немає місця для теорій. Тому що наука заснована на фактах, а творіння засноване на релігійних забобонах. Потрібно багато віри, щоб вірити релігійним теоріям. Коли ви маєте справу з фактами, ви можете просто прийняти їх. Я подумав: "Дуже цікаво в тому класі науки, вони навчили мене, що це був факт, що світу було чотири мільярди років. Сьогодні вони вчать, що це факт, що світу дванадцять мільярдів років. І не так давно я пішов до школи».<br/>Цікаво, що Біблію ніколи не потрібно було переглядати або оновлювати, щоб відповідати поточним даними, які виявили люди. І все ж, якщо ви візьмете сьогодні мої шкільні підручники з природничих наук і спробуєте викладати в них курси з природничих наук, ви побачите, що багато з того, що викладалося як науковий факт, коли я був у середній школі, більше не визнається науковим фактом. Проста клітинна протоплазма більше не є простою клітиною, але надзвичайно складною. Якщо і є якийсь факт, який можна засвідчити в історії, то це факт воскресіння Ісуса Христа з мертвих.<br/>У нас є система юриспруденції, яка базується на показаннях свідків. Якщо людину звинувачують у злочині, і є люди, які були свідками цього злочину, коли він був скоєний, і вони приходять до норми, і вони клянуться сказати правду, всю правду, і нічого, крім правди, то допоможіть їм Бог. І під час допиту вони підтверджують, що: "Я бачив того чоловіка в банку двадцять третього травня. Я бачив, як він витягнув пістолет зі свого пальто. Я чув, як він вимагав, щоб йому віддали всі гроші. Я бачив його, коли він виходив з банку. Я бачив його, як офіцер схопив його надворі ". І якщо ви можете отримати три або чотири свідки, щоб вказати на того чоловіка і буде тримати їх свідчення під перехресним допитом, що людина судиться винним. Він той, хто зробив це. У нас є два або три свідки, які свідчать одну і ту ж історію про цю людину, і це прийнято як факт, що він є тим, хто вчинив злочин і винний. У вас є свідки, які поклялися говорити правду, які перевіряють.<br/>Після смерті Ісуса, коли Він воскрес, Він з'явився багатьом різним людям, які дали присягу свідчити, що вони бачили Його. Що вони говорили з Ним, що Він з'явився їм у різних місцях при різних обставинах. І протягом сорока днів був візит з ними. І в один час, аж до п'ятисот людей, які зібралися в одному місці, Він з'явився. Важко просто відкинути або заперечити свідоцтво цих людей. Зробити це означає дискредитувати всю нашу систему юриспруденції. Але не тільки це, ці люди, які засвідчили, що вони бачили воскреслого Господа, що вони говорили з Ним, що вони їли з Ним, всі вони, за винятком одного, зустріли насильницькі смерті від рук інших людей, тому що вони стверджували, що історія, яку вони розповіли, була правдою. Ви говорите про свідків, які присягаються говорити правду, всю правду, нічого, крім правди. Якби життя людини опинилося під загрозою через цього свідка, і це була брехня, принаймні один з них зламався б під тиском. Вони зізналися б у всьому обмані. "Він показав себе живим після своєї пристрасті багатьма безпомилковими доказами".<br/>Будучи видно від них протягом сорока днів, говорити їм про те, що відноситься до Царства Божого (Дії 1:3):<br/>Іноді ми звинувачуємо учнів через їх питання про час Царства Божого. Нехай пам’ятають, що Царство Боже було улюбленим предметом Ісуса Христа. Він завжди говорив про Царство Боже, і це велика надія, що Він посадив в серцях всіх людей. Речі не завжди будуть продовжувати зіпсовані, як вони є. Світ не збирається йти вічно під владою темряви, під кабалою зла. Бог збирається одного дня встановити своє царство на землі. Царство праведної радості і миру. "Ісус буде царювати там, де перед сонцем проходять його послідовні подорожі. І його царство буде простягатися від берега до берега." І той день буде найславетнішим днем, який світ коли-небудь бачив, як хвороби, страждання і біль будуть скасовані в Його царстві. Як гріх, і жадібність, і ці речі, які зробили світ таким нестерпним місцем, будуть скасовані в Його царстві. Безбожний комерціалізм, експлуатація людини, все це скасовується в Його славетному царстві, коли Він царює. Не дивно, що учні прагнули це зробити. Я прагну це зробити; Я прагну, щоб Його царство прийшло. І Ісус сказав нам, коли ми молимося, перше прохання: "Твоє Царство прийде. Твоя воля буде виконана на землі, як і на небі" (Матвія 6:10). Це правильний вид бажання, яке ми всі повинні мати. Я бажаю Царства Божого. І так Він говорив з ними, протягом цього сорокаденного періоду, про Царство.<br/>І, зібравшись з ними, наказав їм не відходити з Єрусалиму, але чекати обітниці Отця, що, каже, ви чули про Мене (Дії 1:4).<br/>Він сказав: «Ось, почекайте тут, в Єрусалимі, поки не отримаєте обітницю Отця». Ця обітниця, яку Він має на увазі, безсумнівно, є обітницею в Йоіла, де Господь обіцяв: «І станеться в пізніших днях, говорить Господь, що Я виливаю Свій Дух на всяке тіло, і ваші сини і дочки будуть пророкувати, і ваші юнаки будуть мріяти, ваші старці побачать видіння. Обіцянка Отця: прийде день, коли Бог збирається вилити Свого Духа на все тіло, всіх віруючих. Вони, кожен, отримають цю динаміку від Бога.<br/>Бо Іоанн справді охрестився водою, а ви будете охрещені Святим Духом не багато днів відтепер (Дії 1:5).<br/>Ідея хрещення була в тому, що емерсія, bapteedzo. Іоанн охрестився водою, занурив людей у воду, "ти будеш занурений у Святого Духа через небагато днів".<br/>А коли вони зійшлися, то запитали Його, кажучи: Господи, чи не повернеш Ти цього часу царство Ізраїлеві?<br/>"Коли це буде, Господи? Коли час для цього відновлення?" І Ісус говорить з ними зараз, не про царство, але про силу, яку вони збираються отримати за службу. І тому Він відкидає їх питання.<br/>Сказавши їм: Не вам знати ні часу, ні пори, які Отець поставив у Своїй владі (Дії 1:7).<br/>"Це не для вас, щоб знати". Вони постійно жили в очікуванні негайного встановлення царства. Протягом усього життя Ісуса вони очікували, що Він у будь-який момент піде в телефонну будку і вийде як рятівник світу. Шаззам! Показуючи Свою владу і повалення урядів світу, встановлення Божого царства на землі. І вони щодня чекали цієї зміни, щоб здійснитися. І коли Ісус говорив про те, щоб піти в Єрусалим, бути переданим в руки грішної людини, а потім бути розіп'ятим, "О, ні, Господи. Ні, ти не розумієш Царства, Господи. Будь так далеко від Тебе." Коли Ісус помер на хресті, всі були дуже розчаровані.<br/>Двоє учнів на дорозі в Емаус, так сумно. "Гей, хлопці. Чому ви такі сумні, як ваші ходити?" "Що ви маєте на увазі? Ви повинні бути чужинцем навколо тут, якщо ви не знаєте, що сталося останнім часом в Єрусалимі. " Що таке?" "О, хлопець на ім'я Ісус з Назарету ... о, людина, це було сильним і могутнім. Помазання Бога було на Його життя. Ми сподівалися, що в Ньому було визволення Ізраїлю, але вони розіп'яли Його. Ми сподівалися .. тепер він мертвий ". Тепер Він воскрес, і Він каже: "Через кілька днів, хлопці, ви отримаєте обітницю Отця". "О, яка обітниця? Обіцянка встановлення царства?" Бачите, це було законно, що вони повинні запитати. "Це Господь? Гаразд! Чи це час? Чи ви збираєтеся встановити своє царство зараз? "Ні. Це не для вас, щоб знати ті часи, що Отець призначений або що Отець має у своїй власній силі. Але, ви отримаєте силу, коли Дух Святий зійшов на вас."<br/>Тепер тут, грецька приставка епі використовується для позначення нових відносин, які вони повинні були мати зі Святим Духом. У Євангелії від Івана, розділ 14, як Ісус там обіцяє послати Святого Духа, Він сказав: «Я не залишу вас безтішними. Я прийду до вас, і помолюся Отцю, і Він пошле до вас іншого потішителя, Духа Правди, якого світ не може прийняти, бо не бачить Його, і не знає Його, а ви знаєте Його, бо Він живе з вами, і Він буде в вас» (Йо 14:17-18). Те ж грецьке передбачення, що і наше, тільки вони пишуть це "en" замість "in". Двічі відносини там в Іоанна: Він з вами, але Він буде жити в вас. Але тепер Ісус сказав, що ви збираєтеся отримати силу, коли Дух Святий зійде на вас. Грецька препозиція епі, яка перекладається в різних текстах Нового Завіту як "над" або "над" або мені подобається, "переливи".<br/>У сьомому розділі Євангелія від Івана: «Останнього дня, великого дня свята, коли Ісус стояв на Храмовій горі і кричав до народу: «Коли хто спрагу нехай прийде до Мене і нехай п'є; і хто п'є воду, яку Я даю, з його внутрішньої істоти ллються потоки живої води». Іоанн сказав: "Це Він говорив про Духа, який ще не був даний, який повинні прийняти ті, хто вірить в Нього" (Йо 7: 37-39). Що Він говорив про Духа? Що це буде, як потік живої води, що витікає. Мені подобається, коли «дух переповнює вас», над вами, або над вами, або переповнює вас. Таким чином, потрійні відносини: Він з вами до вашого навернення, Він той, хто змушує вас усвідомити, що ви грішник, Він той, хто вказує на Ісуса Христа як відповідь, оскільки Він переконує світ гріха, праведності та суду. Як тільки ви відкриєте своє життя і серце Ісусу Христу і запросите Його прийти, Дух Святий прийде і почне жити в вас. Він буде в вас. "Хіба ви не знаєте, що ви не свої, ви куплені ціною, тому прославляйте Бога в тілі і ваш дух, які Його. І ви не знаєте, що ваше тіло є храм Святого Духа, який в вас? Не пийте вина, в якому є надлишок, але будьте наповнені, або бути наповнені Духом "( 1Co 6: 19-20 , Еф 5: 18 ). Але тепер ось третій відносини. Це розширення досвід.<br/>Ви приймете [дунам , коли Дух Святий зійде на вас [або над вами], і будете мені свідками (Дії 1:8).<br/>І так динамічно, бути свідком Ісуса Христа. Цікаво, що слово свідоцтво по-грецьки є словом Мартус, звідки ми отримуємо наше слово мученик. І по-грецьки це означає мученик. Свідок - це той, хто не тільки проголошує те, у що вірить, він живе тим, у що вірить, він є тим, у що вірить, і він вірить у це так сильно, що в разі необхідності він помре за те, у що вірить. Ось наскільки сильна його віра. Він Мартус. Ви не можете зупинити його, він не боїться померти за те, у що вірить.<br/>Пам’ятаєте, як Павло повертався до Єрусалиму, і Агав зійшов з Кесарії, і взяв пояс Павла, і пов’язав себе, і сказав: «Так і той, хто володіє цим поясом, буде пов’язаний, коли він прийде в Єрусалим». Друзі Павла почали плакати, кажучи: "Ой, Павле, не ходи, не ходи". І він сказав: "Що ти маєш на увазі під цими сльозами? Чи ти думаєш, що ти збираєшся відрадити мене? Чи ти думаєш, що я турбуюсь про те, щоб бути зв'язаним? Я готовий померти." Він був мартом. "Я готовий померти." Будучи вбитий за вашу віру не зробив вас мучеником; тому що ви були мучеником, ви були вбиті. Тому що ви були свідком, тому що ви повірили це так сильно. Отже, це не зробило вас свідком, це лише довело те, ким ви були. Ви були свідком весь час. Якби ви не були мартусом, ви б ніколи не пішли на смерть. Ви б відреклися; ви б сказали: "Ого, ого, почекайте, почекайте. Тримайся, давай змінимо курс тут. Я думаю, що я, можливо, помилився." Тоді ти кажеш: "Ну, він не був мартусом. Викрадення коня не робить тебе злодієм коней; це тільки доводить, що ти був. Ніхто не краде коня, якщо він не злодій коней. Отже, крадіжка не робить вас злодієм, це тільки доводить, що ви були весь цей час. Мучеництво тільки доводить те, що ви були свідком, Мартус. "І ви будете свідками." І чи не цікаво, що більшість з них були замучені? "Свідки Мені."<br/>Свідок мав бути і в Єрусалимі, і по всій Юдеї (Дії 1:8).<br/>Свідок почав прямо з дому. Найважче місце, чи не так? Це почати прямо з дому в Єрусалимі, а потім область навколо Єрусалиму, область Юдеї. А потім вона повинна була поширитися в Самарію. І коли ми вивчимо книгу Дії, то побачимо, як почалося свідоцтво в Єрусалимі. Про це ми дізнаємося в наступному розділі. І тоді ми побачимо, як він почав поширюватися по Юдеї. І тоді Філіп пішов у Самарію, а потім, нарешті, Павло і Варнава покликані йти в крайні частини світу. Таким чином, свідоцтво поширювалося через помазання і посилення Святого Духа.<br/>А коли він говорив це, коли вони дивилися, він був узятий, і хмара прийняла його з їхніх очей» (Дії 1:9).<br/>Це остання обітниця, дана Ісусом Своїм учням. Це воно, останні слова до Його вознесіння. Звичайно, пізніше Він прийшов і говорив з Павлом та іншими, але до Його вознесіння це Його останнє слово. І коли Він говорив це, коли вони дивилися на Нього, Він був узятий, і хмара прийняла Його з очей їх.<br/>І коли вони дивилися на небо, коли Він піднімався, ось двоє чоловіків, які стояли біля них у білому одязі (Дії 1:10).<br/>Припустимо, що вони були ангелами.<br/>Який також сказав: мужі Галілейські, чому ви стоїте, дивлячись на небо? Цей самий Ісус, який взятий від вас на небо, прийде так, як ви бачили, що він пішов на небо (Дії 1:11).<br/>Вони бачили Його, як Він вознісся на небо, і вони побачать Його, коли Він прийде знову. "Ось прийде Господь з десятьма тисячами Своїх святих, щоб виконати суд на землі" (Суд 1:14-15). «Тому, хто полюбив нас, і віддав Себе за нас, і зробив нас нашим Богом, царями і священиками, які будуть царювати з Ним на землі, ось прийде Господь, і побачить Його кожне око, і ті, хто проколов Його, заплакають» (Об’явлення 1:5-7). Отже, Господь приходить. Кожне око побачить Його. Свідки Єгови кажуть, що Він вже прийшов, але це був таємний прихід. Оскільки тільки учні бачили, що Він пішов, то тільки учні, Свідки Єгови, бачили Його повернення. Але Ісус сказав: "Якщо вони скажуть вам: "Він прийшов таємно і увійшов в таємну кімнату не вірте" (Матвія 24:26). Отже, ви повинні вибрати, щоб повірити Ісусу або їм.<br/>«Той самий Ісус, що взятий від вас на небо, прийде так, як ви бачили, як Він іде на небо».<br/>Тепер є дуже цікавий вірш в ІІ Івана, вірш Дії 1:7, "Бо багато обманщиків увійшло в світ, які не визнають, що Ісус Христос прийшов у тілі." Це, на жаль, поганий переклад грецької. Бо це причастя знаходиться в теперішньому часі і повинно бути перекладене як "приходить у тілі". Ті, хто заперечує, що Ісус Христос приходить у тілі. Що Іван каже про них? "Вони обманщик і антихрист. Дивіться самі, щоб не втратити того, що ми зробили, але щоб отримати повну нагороду. Бо хто переступає і не перебуває в вченні Христа, не має Бога. Хто перебуває в вченні Христа, той має і Отця, і Сина. І якщо хтось прийде до ваших дверей (в суботу вранці) і не принесе цього вчення, не приймайте його в свій дім, і не прощайтеся з ним. Бо той, хто прощається з ним, є учасником його злих справ» (2Ів. 1:7-11). Задайте їм одне питання: «Чи Ісус приходить у тілі?» Просто задайте їм це питання. І якщо вони скажуть «ні», просто пам'ятайте, що Іван попереджав вас і що Іван сказав вам. "Якщо хтось не визнає, що Ісус Христос приходить у тілі." Пам'ятаєте, коли Він був з учнями, і Він сказав: "Дайте мені щось поїсти"? Він сказав: "Ви знаєте, духи не їдять; доторкніться до мене. Бачите? Це я." Отже, цей самий Ісус приходить знову так само, як вони бачили, що Він пішов на небо. І я, наприклад, вірю, що це пришестя дуже скоро.<br/>Потім вони повернулися до Єрусалиму з гори під назвою Оливет, що від Єрусалиму в суботу. І ввійшли вони, і ввійшли до горниці, де жили Петро, і Яків, і Іван, і Андрій, і Філіп, і Тома, і Варфоломій, і Матвій, Яків Алфеєвий, і Симон Зелот, і Юда, брат Яків. І всі вони продовжували молитися і молитися разом з жінками і Марією, матір'ю Ісуса, і з Його братами (Дії 1:12-14).<br/>Це остання згадка про Марію, матір Ісуса. На даний момент і з цього моменту, немає ніякої подальшої згадки про неї в Діяннях апостолів або в посланнях. Ніякої згадки про її смерть або про її чудесне сходження на небо, без смерті. Нічого не згадується в Писанні.<br/>Його брати були посиланням, ймовірно, на Якова, Юду та інших братів, які були синами Йосипа та Марії.<br/>Верхня кімната - є деякі, які кажуть, що це та ж верхня кімната, в якій Ісус мав Тайну вечерю зі своїми учнями. І все ж, є інші, які тримаються цієї верхньої кімнати, яка є кімнатою на території храму, де зустрілася рання церква. Вибір за вами.<br/>І в ті дні Петро встав серед учнів, і сказав: (число їх імен разом було близько ста двадцяти), люди, це Писання повинні були бути виконані, що Святий Дух вустами Давида говорив раніше про Юду, який був керівництвом для тих, хто взяв Ісуса (Дії 1:15-16).<br/>Знову ж таки, Петро все той же напористий. Вони чекають в молитві і благанні, і Петро встає і каже: "Товариші, є Писання, яке повинно бути виконано". І ви знаєте, що він буде рухатися вперед, "Давайте розпочнемо програму, давайте кидати жребій і з'ясуємо, хто збирається зайняти місце Юди." Я відчуваю, що Петро знову був у тілі, виявляючи ту стрімку природу, яка була його. І я думаю, що майбутня історія церкви в книзі Дії вказує на це. Мені цікаво, як Петро розуміє Писання, як він цитує так багато місць у Старому Завіті. Петро виявляє дуже велике розуміння старозавітних писань, що є на його користь.<br/>Зверніть увагу, що Петро приписує Святому Духу те, що написав Давид. Таким чином, "Усе Писання дається натхненням від Бога" (2Тим 3:16). Не є частиною Писань. Тому що, якщо ви скажете мені, що частина писань дається натхненням від Бога, то я повинен запитати вас: «Які частини є натхненням, а які не є натхненням?» І тоді ти стаєш авторитетом, який говорить мені, в яку частину я можу вірити, а в яку не можу вірити. І в ту хвилину, коли Бог більше не авторитет, а ти авторитет, я в біді. Остерігайтеся тих, хто каже: «Ні, ви не можете вірити всім Писанням». І тут, Лука в письмовій формі про те, що Петро говорив, заявляє, що Давид був насправді промовець Святого Духа. Святий Дух, вустами Давида, говорив про Юду.<br/>Бо він був перерахований з нами, [він був один з дванадцяти] він отримав частину цього служіння. Але тепер цей чоловік придбав поле з нагородою за беззаконня; і падіння з головою (Дії 1:17-18),<br/>Він придбав поле, поле гончара, як каже Захарія в одинадцятому розділі.<br/>І, впавши головою, розірвався посередині, і всї кишки його вирвалися (Дії 1:18).<br/>Є ті, хто знаходить розбіжності в Писаннях, тому що в одному з Євангелій нам сказано, що коли Юда повернувся і спробував повернути гроші, і вони сказали: "Гей, це твоя проблема. Ми не можемо взяти його." І покласти його назад в скарбницю храму. "Це кров'яні гроші." Потім він кинув його туди на підлогу храму, і він вийшов і повісився. Тут Петро говорить нам, що він впав з головою і просто лопнув. І є ті, хто уявляє невідповідність. Дуже просто, він піднявся на дерево, щоб повіситися, прив'язав мотузку навколо шиї і прив'язав її до кінцівки і стрибнув. І сила падіння або зламала мотузку, або його голову, і він впав вниз в каньйон і так само, як він сказав це тут.<br/>Це було відомо всім мешканцям Єрусалиму, тому що поле було названо їхньою мовою Aceldama, тобто поле крові. Бо написано в книзі Псалмів: Нехай спустошиться його житло, і ніхто нехай не мешкає в ньому; і, Його єпископство нехай бере інший (Дії 1:19-20).<br/>Тепер в дійсності він цитує з двох різних псалмів тут. Від Псалма 69:25, він ставить його разом з Псалмом 109:8. І поєднуючи обидва він знаходить ці пророцтва про Юду.<br/>Тому ці люди (Діяння 1:21)<br/>Тепер ось де вони шукають когось, щоб зайняти місце Юди, щоб бути апостолом. Ось кваліфікації, які вони шукали в той час.<br/>Тому з цих людей, які були з нами весь час, що Господь Ісус, коли в і з нами (Дії 1:21),<br/>Тепер ви пам'ятаєте, було багато учнів, багато учнів з яких Ісус вибрав десять, щоб бути апостолами. І слово апостол означає "той, хто посланий". Або вибрав дванадцять, щоб бути апостолами, тому Він вислав дванадцять. Число людського уряду. "У нас є тільки одинадцять. Нам потрібен один, щоб зайняти місце Юди, але нам потрібен той, хто був з нами весь час від початку з Ісусом."<br/>З того часу, як він був хрещений Іваном, і до дня, коли він був узятий від нас, хтось повинен бути висвячений, щоб бути свідком Його воскресіння (Дії 1:22).<br/>Отже, це були вимоги, які вони шукали. Хтось, хто був навколо цілий час. Від часу хрещення Івана до вознесіння. І той, хто бачив воскреслого Господа, і таким чином міг нести факт воскресіння, своє свідчення факту.<br/>Тепер Павло апостол, пізніше стверджуючи той факт, що він був апостолом, сказав: "Чи я не бачив воскреслого Христа?" Очевидно, це було однією з вимог апостольства. Хтось запитав мене: "Чи є апостоли сьогодні?" Ну, я не знаю. Я не думаю, що є в тому ж сенсі, що вони були в Новому Завіті. Звичайно, ніхто сьогодні не може свідчити про воскресіння, як вони.<br/>Вони призначили двох, Йосип покликав Варсава, який був названий Юст, і Матфій. І вони молилися, і сказали: Ти, Господи, який знає серця всіх людей, покажіть, чи з цих двох, що ви вибрали ( Діяння 1:23-24),<br/>Я думаю, що ми часто робимо цю помилку, даючи Господу два варіанти, обидва неправильні. Обмеження Бога, ви бачите. Ми так схильні робити це. Очевидно, Павло був Божим вибором. Пітер був стрімким, і, стрибаючи з пістолета, сказав: "Гей, ми повинні щось зробити, ви знаєте, повинні допомогти Богові. Ви знаєте, один відсутній, і ми повинні заповнити його." І все ж, "Боже, який з цих двох ви хочете?" І даючи Богові два варіанти.<br/>щоб взяти участь у цьому служінні та апостольстві, з якого Юда впав через проступок, щоб піти до свого місця. І тому вони віддали свої жеребки (Дії 1:25-26 );<br/>Цікавий спосіб, за допомогою якого вони прагнули визначити волю Бога. Давайте кинемо кості, з'ясуємо, що Божа воля тут. Це цікаво для мене, різні способи, які люди придумали, щоб розпізнати волю Бога. Тепер, в часи Старого Завіту, вони мали цікавий спосіб прийти до священика, який запитував Господа про них через Урим і Туммім, "світла і досконалості". Якими були ці Урим і Туммім, ми не знаємо. Я впевнений, що це були не кольорові окуляри, які Джозеф Сміт знайшов із золотими таблетками; магічні окуляри, які, коли ви їх надягаєте, ви могли раптово прочитати ієрогліфічне письмо.<br/>Є ті, хто каже, що урим і туммім були насправді чорним і білим каменем, який носили в сумці на грудях священика. Вони молилися і запитували Господа про конкретне питання. Пам'ятаєте, що Давид питав Господа: "Господи, чи вийдемо на Филистимлян?" Відповідь була: "Ні". І знову, наступного дня: "Господи, чи вийдемо на Филистимлян?" Відповідь була: "Так". "Коли ми підемо?" Вони будуть ставити конкретні питання, і Господь буде направляти їх через Урім і Thummin. Кажуть, що священик буде молитися, шукати Бога, а потім дістатися і витягнути один з двох каменів. Якщо це був білий камінь, це була так відповідь. Якби це було ні, то це був би чорний камінь, який він витягнув. Деякі навіть кажуть, що ми отримуємо термін чорний м'яч від цього Уріма і Тумміма. Насправді, в оригіналі це не голос проти конкретного проекту або ідеї. Що таке урим і туммім, ми не знаємо. Але в період Старого Завіту вони використовували метод жеребкування, щоб визначити волю Бога.<br/>Отже, тут учні беруть те саме, що кидають кістки, щоб побачити, кого з двох людей Бог обрав на заміну Юді Іскаріотському.<br/>І впав жереб на Матвія, і перерахували його до одинадцяти (Дії 1:26).<br/>Тепер хто такий Матвій? Ніхто ніколи не чув про нього ні до, ні після. Буде цікаво зустріти Матвія і дізнатися, хто він і що він зробив. Я думаю, з подальшої історії очевидно припустити, що Бог вибрав Павла апостолом. Павло заявляє про це сам. Тепер це останній раз, коли ми читаємо про них, які прагнуть розпізнати Божу волю киданням жеребків або випадковим чином.<br/>Я знаю, що сьогодні хтось, прагнучи розпізнати волю Господа, буде молитися і запитувати Господа. У нього в кишені буде десять копійок, і як він молиться, він візьме копійки з закритими очима і покладе їх на стіл, і якщо вони всі підійдуть голови, це так. Цікава річ, час від часу, всі вони виходять голови, і це досить хороші шанси. Однак, ми не знаходимо жодної моделі для цього після Святого Духа. Як тільки Святий Дух зійшов на церкву, тоді Святий Дух почав говорити з ними і направляти їх. І Святий Дух сказав: "Розділіть мені Павла і Варнаву для служіння, де я покликав їх" (Діяння 13:2). І Святий Дух послав їх. Таким чином, ми знаходимо, що церква більш безпосередньо керується Святим Духом. Як тільки Святий Дух прийшов, це кидання кістки, щоб дізнатися волю Божу, було відкинуто.<br/>« » (англ.<br/><br/>версії короля Якова<br/><br/>Це 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (також відома як Авторизована версія). |

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Всередині динамічного драйвера є магніт, і коли ви підключаєте навушники, ви посилаєте через нього струм змінного струму, який перетворить звукову котушку в магніт. Залежно від напрямку струму полярність магніту буде змінюватися. Тепер, оскільки ми знаємо для магніту, ті ж заряди відштовхують і різні заряди притягують, ми знаємо, що голосова котушка буде рухатися назад і вперед залежно від її полярності в той час. Голосова котушка прикріплена до діафрагми, яка потім буде рухатися вперед і назад, створюючи звукову хвилю. Те ж саме відбувається і в зворотному напрямку, якщо ви переміщаєте котушку через магніт, ви замість цього виробляєте струм.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader.

Сталінська опозиція всередині партії, в тому числі Бухарін, Ягода і Райков, були очищені в цих показових процесах, оскільки Сталін маніпулятивно змусив їх зізнатися в злочинах планування перевороту і протистояння державі, навіть якщо не було доказів. Габор Тіттерспорн сказав: "Багато жертв були щиро віддані принципам більшовизму". Це підсилює доказ того, що більшовицькі ідеали, які колись були корінням Комуністичної партії, були розірвані і знищені Чистками. Партія була виснажена, і колишні члени безпорадно спостерігали, як Сталін використовував велику чистку як інструмент для перетворення Росії з однопартійної держави в безальтернативну диктатуру. Знову ж таки, чистки руйнували структуру Комуністичної партії, сформованої під час більшовицької революції. Це узгоджується з джерелом "Сталін - виконавець", оскільки обидва показують маніпулятивний характер, який допоміг диктатору посилити свій контроль над горлом Росії.<br/>Маніпулятивний спосіб, яким Сталін інкримінував свою цілеспрямовану опозицію під час чисток, в очах звичайних росіян також мав імплозивний вплив на радянське суспільство. Сталін зумів зібрати підтримку з боку народу за допомогою пропаганди і засобів масової інформації, щоб допомогти йому розвинути «культ особистості» і образ героїчного і хороброго лідера. Завдяки цій підтримці Сталін впровадив недовіру в уми людей, переконуючи їх, що серед них були зрадники революції і ті, кого він назвав «ворогами народу».<br/><br/>Інші документи Яким було короткострокове значення чисток для російського уряду та суспільства<br/><br/>1203 слів - 5 сторінок<br/>Після Другої світової війни Сполучені Штати встановили угоди з країнами по всьому світу для усунення бар'єрів для міжнародної торгівлі та інвестицій.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell є nerfing brawlers замість nerfing star powers. Я був на 750 минулого сезону з power 8 nita, і дуже важко пройти повз те, що, наприклад, зоряні сили відіграють дійсно домінуючу роль. Зв'язок також сміття. Коли я граю в захоплення дорогоцінних каменів (близько 600 трофеїв), часто бувають матчі, де ворожа команда має на одного гравця більше, ніж ми, і це навіть не те, що у нас є lvl 9, щоб конкурувати проти цього. Іноді є навіть матчі, де ворожа команда повністю максимізована, і ніхто з нас. Ось чому я більше не граю в серйозну бійку зірок. Це навіть не схоже на те, що є багато гравців, які не максимізовані і близько 600 трофеїв. Це дратує.<br/>Редагування: Я думаю, що суперклітина повинна мати принаймні базовий механізм, який приймає середні рівні бійців при налаштуванні матчів.<br/><br/>За винятком трофеїв, які насправді не вказують на вашу майстерність. Вони вказують на майстерність товаришів по команді, з якими ви розміщені. І я в порядку, граючи проти бійців вищого рівня, але коли одна команда має рівень 10, а інша - ні, очевидно, що вона незбалансована.<br/><br/>Я рекомендую отримати кілька хороших друзів, щоб грати з, я і 2 друзі отримали моїх друзів потужність 1 галочка на ранг 28, граючи в захоплення дорогоцінних каменів з певною композицією весь день, і ми зробили це без жодного з нас бути максимально з нашими бійцями.<br/><br/>Я знаю, як ви відчуваєте, що у мене були бійці на високих трофеях з низьким рівнем, і важко йти далі, і все, що я говорив собі: "Я хочу мати зоряні сили", дійсно суперклітина повинна збалансувати зоряні сили або, принаймні, зробити кращу систему зближення.<br/><br/>Я начебто відчуваю це. Я не так добре в грі, як ви, але я отримав Emz до 500 на потужності 1, і сватання було жахливим. Максимально гравців скрізь! І це не допомогло, що більшість моїх товаришів по команді мали близько 5-8k трофеїв ... Мені довелося вдатися до сольного розбору в останню хвилину, тому що я можу або засідати в засідку нічого не підозрюючих гравців, або просто грати трохи агресивно в потрібний час. Але мені дуже хотілося б, щоб це було трохи простіше для людей, які хочуть підштовхнути бійців до дійсно високих трофейних діапазонів, не маючи розкоші зоряних сил.<br/><br/>Спайк Altho все ще добре без кривої. Кривий м'яч був просто допомогою для того, щоб вражати ваші постріли частіше, ніж шип. Але навіть до того, як кривий м'яч був випущений, шип був дійсно сильним бійцем, тому він залишиться тим же зараз.<br/><br/>Я згоден з тим, що вони повинні були мати засідку, але я думаю, що вони намагаються збалансувати як Snappy Sniping, так і Ambush, оскільки вони обидва зливаються з цією зміною. Вона стала трохи потужною, але все ще не заслуговує на нерви<br/><br/>Я не впевнений у цьому, але тепер, коли Дерріл отримав помітний бафф, дивлячись на їх нову статистику, схоже, що Дерріл може затьмарити Бика, оскільки він не тільки завжди може завдати більше шкоди, ніж Бик, він більше не помре так рано, тому їх виживання буде аналогічним без зоряної сили (хоча виживання Бика все ще помітно краще, ніж Дерріла, якщо б він мав Tough Guy). Мало того, що супер Дерріла може автоматично відновлюватися, що означає, що Дерріла можна ефективно грати як важковаговика, так і вбивцю одночасно (до того, як він відсмоктується як важкий, але пристойний вбивця)<br/><br/>Але він переоцінений аф. І ви отримуєте трофеї з ним дуже легко. Так що я в порядку з нерфом. Я навіть не грав з тих пір, коли я отримав його до 500 (близько 5 місяців тому), так що мені байдуже, що теж.<br/><br/>Чому Poco / Penny не отримують HP nerf, якщо вони Marksman / Healer відповідно не танк?<br/>Чому роза не нервує, кашляють 70% зменшення ушкоджень?<br/>Чому Tick дозволяється мати найвищий діапазон і найбільш вільний pokedamage у всій грі?<br/>Чому Леон не отримує бафф HP / Damage?<br/><br/>Як би там не було, це був Ambush, який був OP, а не базовий Piper. Я б стверджував, що Ambush є кращою зоряною силою в грі (тепер ще більше, оскільки відсоток збільшення шкоди опосередковано пішов вгору), а база Piper була нижньою 10 бійцем.<br/><br/>Що Supercell повинен зробити, це повернути обидва нерви, зменшити Ambush до 600, і зменшити Snappy Sniping до 0,25, оскільки він буде опосередковано наповнений баффом пошкодження бази.<br/><br/>Так, і я вважаю, що вони зайшли занадто далеко з Розою, тому що тепер вона в основному кращий бик зараз, коли справа доходить до танкування, яким вона була деякий час. Тепер Дерріл може бути меншим, більш потужним биком<br/><br/>Чому? Я відчуваю, що їй потрібен бафф майже у всьому, крім її зоряної сили. її здоров'я і швидкість роблять її супер трохи складніше у використанні, тому що вона може померти досить легко, і це дійсно важко для неї, щоб заманити в пастку більш швидких бійців, як Ворон. Зірка трохи розбита, але... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Самозайнятість Частина 1<br/><br/>Коли ви приймаєте роботу в будь-якій організації, ви повинні виконувати різні роботи відповідно до вимог вашого роботодавця, і ви можете отримати фіксовану суму доходу в якості заробітної плати. Ви можете запустити невеликий роздрібний магазин, крамничку, ресторан, пекарню і кондитерські вироби, салон краси і т.д. у вашій місцевості. Ви можете зайнятися торгівлею або виробництвом в невеликих масштабах або наданням деяких послуг за ціну. Така економічна діяльність називається самозайнятістю.<br/><br/>Значення самозайнятості<br/><br/>Наш батько, мати, брати, сестри та інші можуть займатися різними видами економічної діяльності, завдяки яким вони заробляють собі на життя. Ці люди займаються економічною діяльністю, яка називається найманою або оплачуваною роботою. Але є багато людей, які займаються професією або якимось бізнесом, який вони починають і керують самостійно. Вони прикладають максимум зусиль і беруть на себе всі ризики, щоб успішно продовжувати свою кар'єру. Весь заробіток від їх роботи йде до них. Всі ми бачили невеликі продуктові магазини, крамниці, медичні магазини і т.д. в нашій місцевості. Вони володіють і управляються людиною, з або без допомоги деяких помічників.

Таким чином, самозайнятість може забезпечити роботу іншим особам.<br/><br/>Заробіток від самозайнятості не є фіксованим. Це залежить від доходу, який можна заробити, виробляючи або купуючи та продаючи товари або надаючи послуги іншим за ціною.<br/><br/>У самозайнятості, власник повинен взяти на себе прибуток і нести ризик втрати. Таким чином, ми знаходимо прямий зв'язок між зусиллями і винагородою в самозайнятості.<br/><br/>Це вимагає певної кількості капітальних вкладень, хоча вони можуть бути невеликими.<br/><br/>При самозайнятості людина вільна приймати рішення щодо ведення свого бізнесу з прибутком і користуватися будь-якою можливістю, яка може виникнути для розширення його бізнесу. Це дає повну свободу працювати відповідно до власної волі і в рамках параметрів чинних законів.<br/><br/>Таким чином, самозайнятість може бути визначена як економічна діяльність, яку людина може виконувати самостійно як оплачувану професію, і вона може складатися з виробництва та продажу товарів, купівлі та продажу товарів або надання послуг за певну ціну. |
