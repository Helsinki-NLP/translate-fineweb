| Political Selling 101<br/><br/>Written by Dave Stein<br/><br/>Note: To see charts in this article, view it on  Most people who have been selling for even a short period of time understand that some level of corporate politics is present in every organization into which they sell. As sales professionals' experience and political savvy increases, so does what they observe in their accounts. If you aren't aware of political activity in your accounts, it doesn't mean that it isn't there. It just means you can't see it and certainly can't leverage it. If your competitor is politically savvy, you are at a distinct disadvantage. What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster one definition is, "competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership." Winners have developed a set of skills that enables them to consistently succeed because of, or in spite of, politics. They've learned to select right competing interest groups and then ride power and leadership wave to success by devising and executing political strategies for each key influencer and decision maker. Being adept politically will rarely lead to a win by itself. There are many other components to winning. But to not understand and take advantage of interpersonal forces within an account is to leave assets unleveraged. Here are some of key skills required to elevate yourself into realm of political selling: Skill: A basic understanding of how corporate politics works. For our purposes, politics and influence are synonymous. People need help of other people to achieve certain business goals (i.e. my department's project gets funded) as well as business-driven personal goals (i.e. if it is successful, I get a raise--I can afford that new house). Within a company, it works something like this: "If you report to me I can just tell you to do something and you will do it." That's SAY-SO influence. You'll do it because I say so. But if you don't work for me--let's say you work in another department--it becomes more difficult. I then have to influence you to help me. I'll use POLITICAL influence. That requires a combination of skills and artistry and it takes time and strategy. Here is an example: Let's say that we both work for same company, but for different departments. If I need your help for my department to achieve its quarterly objectives, I might look for ways in which I can help you achieve your objectives (ideally, business and personal objectives) and subtly advertise those to you as benefits of helping me. In that way we are aligned with a set of common interdependent purposes. Win-win. When you are selling into a company, you have absolutely no SAY-SO over buyer. You can't tell anyone in your customer's company what to do. You can only influence them to give you information, insights, coaching and preference so that they influence others to look at you and your offering favorably. The best way to influence someone is to clearly communicate how and by how much you will contribute to advancement of their business and (business-related) personal goals. In diagram below, you'll see that when you can help a buyer or influencer meet their personal and business goals (Quadrant 1), you're much more likely to gain commitment from them in helping you win. In Quadrant 2, there is no personal win, so their commitment, although altruistic so far as a contribution to their company, will not be supported as strongly. Stay away from people in Quadrant 3. In those cases, person you are selling to is "in it for themselves," acting counter to what is in best interests of their company. You run risk of not only losing deal, but being associated with "dirty politics," which could affect your personal and your company's reputation. Quadrant 4 reminds you that if you find you can't contribute to person achieving their business or personal goals, your likelihood of gaining their support is minimal. Don't turn these people into enemies, but focus your efforts on finding and selling to influencers in first quadrant. Skill: The ability to see what's invisible As I suggested earlier, not everyone is skilled enough to observe sophisticated corporate politicians being influential. Savvy politicians do their thing privately. It's not unlike backroom deals done by government politicians. How do you know that there is influence being wielded? First, assume it is. Then begin to look at results and work backward. We can extract a good example from everyday government politics: If there is "pork"--say $650.3 million in corporate tax benefits for igloo manufacturers in Alaska--embedded in a House of Representatives education bill, you can quickly figure out who lent a hand getting it through committee. Ask your contacts within your customer's company or government department about prior purchases, projects and initiatives. Find out who sponsored them, whose budgets paid for them, who were ultimate decision makers and who benefited in some more personal ways. The names you come up with will likely be people of influence, either through their command of an organization, or through astute politicking. They are ones for whose influence you will be positioning during your sales campaign. Skill: Connecting dots You've done some discovery and have begun to make associations. When you asked about recent projects, several people referenced Carrie Miehome, who works in IT organization. She deftly led steering committee with CRM project last year. Funny thing though, that project was put ahead of others that already had funding. Why would that be, you might ask? Who benefits from a CRM implementation? The VP of Sales? The VP of Customer Service? Perhaps CFO who wants more visibility into revenue stream... It's perfectly reasonable to expect that she was influenced by a higher power. The challenge will be finding out whom, what was in it for them and what was in it for her if you are selling IT solutions to that company. Skill: Knowing how to map out organization You'll need to start with an organization chart. If they won't give you one, you can build one by getting answers to pointed questions about reporting structure, by reading information on web and, if your customer is a public company, from corporate SEC filings.<br/><br/>Why Write a Sales Letter for Each Product?<br/><br/>Authors/publishers are great at getting their books written. Entrepreneurs know their products. But after initial one-year honeymoon, sales slow down. To counter this make sure your ebook, product, or service you offer will keep on selling from first day, first year, even for life. Write a short sales letter for each product or ebook.<br/><br/>Whether you have a Web site or not, you can write a first class, must-buy-now sales letter. Write one for each teleclass, eBook, product, or service. I even write one for my bookcoaching services.<br/><br/>If you are like me and have a Web site, it is content driven. Why? Because that's why people come to any site--to get free information. You must also give them a reason to buy. Most home pages say too much about author or book instead of intriguing their potential buyers with a benefit- driven headline, which in turns leads them to benefits of their books--the sales letter.<br/><br/>My first Web site had many fine books and kits in personal growth and book writing and marketing. Sales never went over $200 a month. To correct that, I created a new site and paid special attention to its sales language (without hype) for each teleclass, eBook, and book coaching opportunities to suit each income and need. Sales were $75 first month, and in four months they reached $2265. The next year they went around $3000 a month.<br/><br/>What Every Sales Letter Needs to Pull Orders and Profits<br/><br/>You can write each sales letter in less than four hours first time. As you practice, you can write them in two hours.<br/><br/>1. Start Letter with a Benefit-Driven Headline.<br/><br/>Include these headlines throughout your sales letter. "Want a quick and easy way to quadruple your Online Income in Four Months?<br/><br/>If you answered, "yes" to yourself, headline succeeds, because you will keep reading. If you said "No, I don't believe this, " but I'm curious where this is going," headline still succeeds. You win when your headline seduces your potential customer to read on in your sales letter to discover your product[']s benefits and features, some fine testimonials, and finally to click "buy now" which takes them to order page.<br/><br/>2. List Top Five Benefits of your Product or Service in bullet form.<br/><br/>To define your top benefits start with a list of problems your client or customer wants solutions for. Each specific problem you answer can be labeled a benefit. If you are not rock sure of who your audience is, your sales copy dribbles away and doesn't meet its target. Keep redefining your audience and know as much about them as you can.<br/><br/>Remember that one benefit is top undeniable benefit—usually more money easier, more clients faster, more profits from Web sales, better relationships, and health.<br/><br/>If you have more than five benefits collected in a list, sprinkle rest throughout your copy. How will your book make someone's life easier, richer in time or money, help their personal growth, provide additional income, entertain them? How will your product or service make them a better business person, more attractive, feel better, avoid catastrophe, sickness, or surgery?<br/><br/>3. Address your Potential Buyer's Resistances.<br/><br/>Remember to tell a background story of where they are NOW so they will emotionally connect with your solutions (the product or service). Let's say they want to write an eBook or print book to make themselves "expert," make life-long passive income, or share their unique message. | Продаж 101<br/><br/>Створення Dave Stein<br/><br/>Примітка: щоб побачити діаграми в цій статті, перегляньте його на Більшість людей, які продавали навіть протягом короткого періоду часу, розуміють, що певний рівень корпоративної політики присутній в кожній організації, в якій вони продають. У міру того, як досвід і політична підкованість фахівців з продажу зростає, зростає і те, що вони спостерігають у своїх облікових записах. Якщо ви не знаєте про політичну активність у своїх облікових записах, це не означає, що її немає. Це просто означає, що ви не можете бачити його і, звичайно, не може використовувати його. Якщо ваш конкурент політично підкований, ви перебуваєте в явному невигідному становищі. Що таке політика? Згідно з Merriam-Webster одним з визначень є "конкуренція між конкуруючими групами інтересів або індивідами за владу і лідерство". Переможці розробили набір навичок, які дозволяють їм послідовно досягати успіху через або всупереч політиці. Вони навчилися вибирати правильні конкуруючі групи інтересів, а потім їздити на хвилі влади та лідерства до успіху, розробляючи та реалізуючи політичні стратегії для кожного ключового впливового та відповідального за прийняття рішень. Будучи досвідченим політично рідко призведе до перемоги сам по собі. Є багато інших компонентів для перемоги. Але не зрозуміти і скористатися міжособистісними силами всередині рахунку, щоб залишити активи невикористаними. Ось деякі з ключових навичок, необхідних для того, щоб підняти себе в сферу політичних продажів: Навички: базове розуміння того, як працює корпоративна політика. Для наших цілей політика та вплив є синонімами. Люди потребують допомоги інших людей для досягнення певних бізнес-цілей (тобто проект мого відділу фінансується), а також бізнес-керованих особистих цілей (тобто, якщо він буде успішним, я отримую підвищення - я можу собі дозволити, що новий будинок). Всередині компанії це працює приблизно так: «Якщо ви повідомите мені, я можу просто сказати вам щось зробити, і ви це зробите». Це вплив SAY-SO. Ви зробите це, тому що я так кажу. Але якщо ви не працюєте на мене - скажімо, ви працюєте в іншому відділі - це стає важче. Тоді я повинен впливати на вас, щоб допомогти мені. Я буду використовувати ПОЛІТИЧНИЙ вплив. Це вимагає поєднання навичок і артистизму, і це вимагає часу і стратегії. Ось приклад: Припустимо, що ми обидва працюємо в одній компанії, але для різних відділів. Якщо мені потрібна ваша допомога для мого відділу для досягнення своїх квартальних цілей, я міг би шукати способи, якими я можу допомогти вам досягти ваших цілей (в ідеалі, ділових і особистих цілей) і тонко рекламувати їх вам як переваги допомоги мені. Таким чином, ми узгоджені з набором загальних взаємозалежних цілей. Win-win. Коли ви продаєте в компанію, у вас абсолютно немає SAY-SO над покупцем. Ви не можете сказати нікому в компанії вашого клієнта, що робити. Ви можете тільки впливати на них, щоб дати вам інформацію, розуміння, коучинг і переваги, щоб вони впливали на інших, щоб дивитися на вас і вашу пропозицію схвально. Найкращий спосіб вплинути на когось - це чітко повідомити, як і наскільки ви будете сприяти просуванню свого бізнесу та (пов'язаних з бізнесом) особистих цілей. На діаграмі нижче ви побачите, що, коли ви можете допомогти покупцеві або впливовій особі досягти своїх особистих і ділових цілей (квадрант 1), ви набагато більше шансів отримати від них зобов'язання, допомагаючи вам виграти. У квадранті 2 немає особистого виграшу, тому їхня прихильність, хоча і альтруїстична наскільки внесок у їхню компанію, не буде підтримуватися так сильно. Тримайтеся подалі від людей у квадранті 3. У цих випадках людина, якій ви продаєте, «в цьому для себе», діючи всупереч тому, що найкращим чином відповідає інтересам їх компанії. Ви ризикуєте не тільки втратити угоду, але і бути пов'язаним з "брудною політикою", яка може вплинути на вашу особисту репутацію і репутацію вашої компанії. Квадрат 4 нагадує вам, що якщо ви не можете допомогти людині досягти своїх ділових або особистих цілей, ваша ймовірність отримати їх підтримку мінімальна. Не перетворюйте цих людей на ворогів, але зосередьте свої зусилля на пошуку та продажу впливовим особам у першому квадранті. Навички: Здатність бачити те, що невидимо, як я пропонував раніше, не всі достатньо вправні, щоб спостерігати, як витончені корпоративні політики впливові. Розумні політики роблять свою справу приватно. Це мало чим відрізняється від закулісних угод, зроблених урядовими політиками. Звідки ви знаєте, що існує вплив? По-перше, припустимо, що це так. Потім почніть дивитися на результати і працювати назад. Ми можемо витягти хороший приклад з повсякденної політики уряду: якщо є "свинина" - скажімо, 650,3 мільйона доларів корпоративних податкових пільг для виробників іглу на Алясці - внесені в законопроект про освіту Палати представників, ви можете швидко з'ясувати, хто позичив руку, отримавши її через комітет. Запитайте своїх контактів у компанії або урядовому відділі вашого клієнта про попередні покупки, проекти та ініціативи. Дізнайтеся, хто їх спонсорував, чиї бюджети їх оплачували, хто був кінцевим керівником і хто отримував вигоду в деяких більш особистих способах. Імена, які ви придумали, ймовірно, будуть впливовими людьми, або через їх командування організацією, або через проникливе політикування. Це ті, чий вплив ви будете позиціонувати під час вашої кампанії з продажу. Навичка: З'єднання точок Ви зробили деякі відкриття і почали створювати асоціації. Коли ви запитали про недавні проекти, кілька людей посилалися на Керрі Міхоум, яка працює в ІТ-організації. Вона вміло очолила керівний комітет з проектом CRM в минулому році. Смішно, однак, що цей проект був поставлений вище інших, які вже мали фінансування. Чому це буде, ви можете запитати? Хто отримує вигоду від впровадження CRM? Віце-президент з продажів? Віце-президент з обслуговування клієнтів? Можливо, фінансовий директор, який хоче більше видимості в потоці доходів ... Це цілком розумно очікувати, що вона була під впливом вищої влади. Завданням буде з'ясувати, хто, що було в ньому для них і що було в ньому для неї, якщо ви продаєте ІТ-рішення цій компанії. Навичка: Знаючи, як намітити організацію Вам потрібно буде почати з організаційної схеми. Якщо вони не дадуть вам один, ви можете побудувати один, отримавши відповіді на вказані питання про структуру звітності, читаючи інформацію в Інтернеті і, якщо ваш клієнт є публічною компанією, з корпоративних подань SEC.<br/><br/>Навіщо писати торговий лист для кожного продукту?<br/><br/>Автори / видавці чудово пишуть свої книги. Підприємці знають свою продукцію. Але після початкового однорічного медового місяця продажі сповільнюються. Щоб протидіяти цьому, переконайтеся, що ваша електронна книга, продукт або послуга, яку ви пропонуєте, буде продовжувати продавати з першого дня, першого року, навіть на все життя. Напишіть короткий лист про продаж для кожного продукту або електронної книги.<br/><br/>Незалежно від того, чи є у вас веб-сайт, ви можете написати перший клас, must-buy-now sales letter. Напишіть по одному для кожного телекласу, електронної книги, продукту або послуги. Я навіть напишу один для моїх послуг bookcoaching.<br/><br/>Якщо ви схожі на мене і у вас є веб-сайт, це контент. Чому? Тому що люди приходять на будь-який сайт - щоб отримати безкоштовну інформацію. Ви також повинні дати їм причину для покупки. Більшість домашніх сторінок занадто багато говорять про автора або книгу, замість того, щоб інтригувати своїх потенційних покупців заголовком, що, в свою чергу, призводить їх до переваг своїх книг - листа про продаж.<br/><br/>Мій перший веб-сайт мав багато гарних книг та наборів для особистого зростання та написання книг та маркетингу. Продажі ніколи не перевищували 200 доларів на місяць. Щоб виправити це, я створив новий сайт і приділив особливу увагу його мові продажів (без хайпу) для кожного телекласу, електронної книги та можливості коучинга книг, щоб задовольнити кожен дохід та потребу. Продажі були $ 75 перший місяць, і за чотири місяці вони досягли $ 2265. Наступного року вони йшли близько 3000 доларів на місяць.<br/><br/>Що кожен лист про продаж повинен витягти замовлення і прибуток<br/><br/>Ви можете написати кожен продажний лист менш ніж за чотири години в перший раз. По мірі того, як ви практикуєте, ви можете написати їх за дві години.<br/><br/>1. Почніть лист з заголовком, орієнтованим на вигоду.<br/><br/>Включіть ці заголовки у вашому листі з продажу. "Хочете швидкий і простий спосіб в чотири рази збільшити свій дохід в Інтернеті за чотири місяці?<br/><br/>Якщо ви відповіли «так» собі, заголовок має успіх, тому що ви будете продовжувати читати. Якщо ви сказали «Ні, я не вірю в це», але мені цікаво, куди це йде, заголовок все ще має успіх. Ви виграєте, коли ваш заголовок спокушає вашого потенційного клієнта, щоб прочитати у своєму листі про продаж, щоб дізнатися про переваги та особливості вашого продукту, деякі прекрасні відгуки та, нарешті, натиснути кнопку "купити зараз", яка приймає їх на сторінку замовлення.<br/><br/>2. Перерахуйте п'ять основних переваг вашого продукту або послуги у формі кулі.<br/><br/>Щоб визначити ваші основні переваги, почніть зі списку проблем, для яких ваш клієнт або клієнт хоче рішення. Кожна конкретна проблема, на яку ви відповідаєте, може бути позначена як перевага. Якщо ви не впевнені в тому, хто ваша аудиторія, ваша копія продажів дриблінг далеко і не відповідає своїй меті. Продовжуйте перевизначати свою аудиторію і знати якомога більше про них.<br/><br/>Пам'ятайте, що одна перевага - це безперечна перевага - як правило, більше грошей легше, більше клієнтів швидше, більше прибутку від веб-продажів, кращі відносини та здоров'я.<br/><br/>Якщо у вас в списку зібрано більше п'яти пільг, розсипайте відпочинок по всьому примірнику. Як ваша книга зробить чиєсь життя легшим, багатшим часом або грошима, допоможе їх особистому зростанню, забезпечить додатковий дохід, розважить їх? Як ваш продукт або послуга зробить їх кращою діловою людиною, більш привабливою, відчувати себе краще, уникнути катастрофи, хвороби або операції?<br/><br/>3. Зверніть увагу на опір вашого потенційного покупця.<br/><br/>Не забудьте розповісти історію про те, де вони зараз, щоб вони емоційно з'єдналися з вашими рішеннями (продуктом або послугою). Скажімо, вони хочуть написати електронну книгу або друковану книгу, щоб зробити себе «експертом», зробити довічний пасивний дохід або поділитися своїм унікальним повідомленням. |

We believe, teach and practice all things that Jesus taught and were practiced by the Church in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Jesus called his disciples to be salt and light. Salt is a preservative but it is also something that adds savor and enjoyment to our daily food. Light is a symbol of truth; it is comforting, penetrating, guiding and exposes darkness. We seek to preserve biblical truth and shed the glorious light of the Gospel in a world that is consumed by darkness.<br/><br/>Watch the webcast eaec.org/webcast.htm<br/><br/>ABOUT THE VIDEO<br/><br/>God has given progressive revelations throughout the Bible and it is with this knowledge that we can deduce there was a creation prior to Adam. We don't know how long it lasted but Lucifer was an angel who led a rebellion in heaven and started a war that affected the entire universe. The earth was his planet and he ruled from Eden, the same place where God would later put Adam and Eve. As Lucifer's last stand, the earth would have been damaged and looked much like Berlin did at the end of World War II. This would explain why the Bible speaks about a re-creation and God's call to replenish the earth. Adam and Eve were thrown into the conflict to prove that God is righteous to the angelic world. The rewards are potentially enormous: eternal life and being joint heirs with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>If there was indeed a pre-Adamic civilization with commerce and war, then you shouldn't be surprised when a new world order emerges in the future that calls for peace and offers membership to anyone who will take an oath of loyalty and receive an identification mark that will give you access to the new financial system.

Ми віримо, навчаємо і практикуємо все те, чого навчав і що практикувала Церква в книзі Дії Апостолів. Ісус назвав Своїх учнів сіллю і світлом. Сіль є консервантом, але це також те, що додає смак і задоволення до нашої щоденної їжі. Світло є символом істини; це потішає, проникає, направляє і викриває темряву.

Ми не знаємо, як довго це тривало, але Люцифер був ангелом, який очолив повстання на небі і почав війну, яка вплинула на весь Всесвіт. Земля була його планетою, і він правив з Едему, того самого місця, де пізніше Бог помістив Адама і Єву. Як остання позиція Люцифера, Земля була б пошкоджена і виглядала так само, як Берлін наприкінці Другої світової війни. Це пояснює, чому Біблія говорить про відтворення і Божий заклик поповнити Землю. Адам і Єва були кинуті в конфлікт, щоб довести, що Бог праведний для ангельського світу. Нагороди потенційно величезні: вічне життя і співспадкоємці з Ісусом Христом.<br/><br/>Якщо дійсно існувала доадамівська цивілізація з комерцією і війною, то ви не повинні дивуватися, коли в майбутньому з'явиться новий світовий порядок, який закликає до миру і пропонує членство кожному, хто дасть клятву вірності і отримає ідентифікаційний знак, який дасть вам доступ до нової фінансової системи.

| Post oak leaves have distinctive cross shape<br/><br/>So said the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray, on page 451 in his encyclopedic "Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology," a book published in 1872.<br/><br/>I got my copy at an old bookstore several years ago. I can't remember where exactly. The book is some 700 pages long, not including a series of gorgeous line drawings of sedges, grasses and ferns in the back. The pages feature fore edge marbling…a bit faded now… and the front and back covers are ornamented, with the monogram of the publishing house. They don't make books like this anymore.<br/><br/>Professor Gray was, of course, referring to what we have as this week's Mystery Plant, the post oak, Quercus stellata. I'm pretty confident that all you botanists out there will recognize this instantly as some sort of oak.<br/><br/>Post oak leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces.(Photo: Keith Bradley)<br/><br/>Oaks belong to the genus Quercus…and they are not always large trees. Some species, of course, are called "scrub oaks", which seems to me a bit of a botanical "put-down", and other species are good examples of shrubs, not more than about knee-high.<br/><br/>Here in the Southeast, we have about 45 native oak species, most of which can rather easily be differentiated into two groups: "White oaks" (including our Mystery Plant) have rounded lobes, without any points or bristles on the tips.<br/><br/>"Red oaks" feature sharply pointed lobes, each with a prominent bristle at the top. There are some other differences, too.<br/><br/>Post oak is widely distributed in the eastern USA, from southern New England through Missouri and Texas, and then east from there, including northern Florida. It is a deciduous species, producing pale, somewhat shreddy or scaly bark. Really large, old individuals can be over 60 feet tall, and because of this, they make great shade trees along city streets and in parks.<br/><br/>The acorns take one season to mature, and they are a valuable wildlife food source. What most people remember about this species are the leaves. The leaves are bright green, and scratchy on the surfaces. Generally, the leaves have a distinctive cross-shaped ("cruciform") look, with two major lobes projected more or less horizontally from the midrib.<br/><br/>The cross-shape is not always well-developed from individual to individual, however, especially is there has been any hybridization going on. (Oak species are famous for mixing it up with each other.)<br/><br/>And this is interesting: Professor Gray refers to this oak in his book by using an incorrect name. The correct and first valid name came about in 1787, penned by a German botanist named Friedrich von Wangenheim. But for some reason, Gray printed the name Quercus obtusiloba, which had been proposed by the French botanist, Andre Michaux. But Michaux was 15 years late — je regrette.<br/><br/>John Nelson is the curator of the A. C.

Я не можу пригадати, де саме. Книга довжиною близько 700 сторінок, не включаючи серію чудових лінійних малюнків осоки, трави та папороті ззаду. Сторінки переднього краю мармуру ... трохи потьмяніли тепер ... і передня і задня обкладинки орнаментовані, з монограмою видавництва. Вони більше не роблять таких книг.<br/><br/>Професор Грей, звичайно, мав на увазі те, що ми маємо на цьому тижні Таємнича рослина, пост дуб, Quercus stellata. Я досить впевнений, що всі ви, ботаніки, відразу впізнаєте це як якийсь дуб.<br/><br/>Листя пост дуба яскраво-зелені, і подряпини на поверхнях. (Фото: Кіт Бредлі)<br/><br/>Дуби відносяться до роду Quercus...і це не завжди великі дерева. Деякі види, звичайно ж, називаються "скрубні дуби", що здається мені трохи ботанічним "вниз", а інші види є хорошими прикладами кущів, не більше ніж про колінах.<br/><br/>Тут, на південному сході, ми маємо близько 45 місцевих видів дуба, більшість з яких можна досить легко диференціювати на дві групи: «білі дуби» (включаючи нашу Таємничу рослину) мають округлі частки, без будь-яких точок або щетинок на кінчиках.<br/><br/>«Червоні дуби» мають гостро загострені частки, кожна з помітною щетиною на вершині. Є й деякі інші відмінності.<br/><br/>Пост дуб широко поширений на сході США, від південної Нової Англії через Міссурі і Техас, а потім на схід звідти, в тому числі на півночі Флориди. Це листяний вид, що виробляє бліду, дещо подрібнену або лускату кору. Дійсно великі, старі особини можуть бути більш ніж 60 футів у висоту, і через це, вони роблять великі тінисті дерева вздовж міських вулиць і в парках.<br/><br/>Жолуді дозрівають протягом одного сезону, і вони є цінним джерелом їжі для дикої природи. Те, що більшість людей пам'ятають про цей вид, - це листя. Листя яскраво-зелені та подряпини на поверхнях. Як правило, листя мають характерний хрестоподібний («крестоподібний») вигляд, з двома основними частками, що проектуються більш-менш горизонтально від середньої ребра.<br/><br/>Перехресна форма не завжди добре розвинена від індивідуума до індивідуума, однак, особливо відбувається будь-яка гібридизація. (Дубові види славляться змішуванням його один з одним.)<br/><br/>І це цікаво: професор Грей посилається на цей дуб у своїй книзі, використовуючи неправильну назву. Правильна і перша коректна назва з'явилася в 1787 році, написана німецьким ботаніком Фрідріхом фон Вангенхаймом. Але чомусь Грей надрукував назву Quercus obtusiloba, яку запропонував французький ботанік Андре Мішо. Але Мішо запізнився на 15 років — je regrette.<br/><br/>Джон Нельсон є куратором гербарію A. C.
