| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Основною метою цього типу поезії є створення віршів через співпрацю різних авторів / поетів, намагаючись сформувати єдиний голос, зберігаючи при цьому свої індивідуальні голоси.<br/><br/>Прикладів співпраці багато в японській поезії. Хоча точні розповіді та записи багатьох таких подій або втрачені, або відсутні.<br/><br/>Одним з найвідоміших прикладів колективного написання поезії була збірка віршів під назвою Ralentir Travaux французьких поетів-сюрреалістів Андре Бретона, Поля Елюара і Рене Шара. Ці три поети співпрацювали, щоб написати вірші в цій збірці протягом всього п'яти днів в 1930 році.<br/><br/>Протягом 1940-х років Чарльз Анрі Форд, американський поет, винайшов те, що він назвав «ланцюговою поемою», де кожен поет написав рядок, а потім відправив поему іншій людині (для продовження) в іншій частині світу, поштою.<br/><br/>У 2007 році збірка американської спільної поезії «Святі істерії: півстоліття спільної американської поезії» була відредагована і опублікована Деніс Дюамель, Морін Сітон і Девідом Тринідадом.<br/><br/>Спільна поезія була використана в школах і коледжах, щоб навчити студентів командній роботі і виявити способи, в яких вони пов'язані.<br/><br/>Вивчення фігури на відкритому повітрі: жінка з парасолькою, ліворуч, 1886<br/><br/>Клод Моне [Суспільне надбання або Суспільне надбання], через Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Мета цієї статті і як підійти до виклику<br/><br/>Кілька років тому я написав статтю під назвою «Поема без кінця», яка включала різдвяну поему, яку я написав, яка піддалася доданню. Я був вражений відповіддю, оскільки на тому етапі у мене було лише кілька послідовників тут. Люди написали строфу поезії кожен в "коментарі" на хабі, щоб слідувати з попередньої строфи коментатора. Це спрацювало дуже добре, і в кінці я зібрав всі внески в один вірш як частина хабу.<br/><br/>Аналогічні виклики були видані з тих пір, в тому числі один Френк Атанасіо під назвою "Духи сидять як скорботи", який також був дуже успішним. Різниця в тому, що в цьому випадку учасники написали свої власні центри для своєї строфи поезії і розмістили посилання на оригінальний центр Френка.<br/><br/>Для цього конкретного виклику я не очікую, що всі будуть витрачати дорогоцінний час на написання окремих центрів для однієї строфи поезії (якщо ви дійсно не хочете). Основна проблема полягає в тому, що для того, щоб зробити його ефективним, вам доведеться скопіювати раніше написані частини поеми на ваш концентратор і, ймовірно, буде вражений ярликом «дублікація».<br/><br/>Отже, це так, а також зберегти необхідність залишати посилання скрізь, я просто прошу, щоб кожен, хто хоче взяти участь, просто напишіть свою строфу тут у "коментарі". Перевірте останній коментар перед вашим, який сприяє виклику і слідувати далі. Якщо я побачу більше одного, що слідує з тієї ж строфи, я буду використовувати свою поетичну ліцензію, щоб працювати над ними так, як я вважаю за краще.<br/><br/>На певному етапі, коли я відчуваю, що було додано достатньо строф, я, ймовірно, закликаю до кінця виклику, а потім зібрати їх всі разом як завершений вірш як частину статті (також віддаючи належне кожному учаснику).<br/><br/>Квітковий берег річки, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Клод Моне [Суспільне надбання], через Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Виклик!<br/><br/>А тепер найцікавіша частина. Якщо ви приєднаєтеся до цього ланцюжка поезії виклику, ви повинні спробувати зберегти стиль і голос поеми якомога ближче до попередніх віршів, так що неінформованим читачам буде здаватися, що тільки один автор написав весь вірш.<br/><br/>Звучить легко, ви кажете? Ну, можливо, це було б, якби поема мала традиційний стиль, риму або метр. Але це не так! Поема, яку ви будете додавати, була розпочата знайомим моїм Андріалфом як "ланцюжок поеми виклик" в іншому місці. На момент написання статті я був єдиною людиною, яка прийняла виклик, і тому, що я любив цю тему, я думав, що це буде великим викликом для моїх колег-письменників, і вирішив використати її тут і подивитися, чи буде відповідь краще. (Я знаю кілька поетів, чиї твори відповідали б цьому стилю).<br/><br/>Правила:<br/><br/>Слідкуйте за попередньою строфою в коментарях<br/><br/>Спробуйте зберегти голос і стиль поеми<br/><br/>Тримайте свою строфу / вірш приблизно такою ж довжиною, як і раніше<br/><br/>Клод Моне був одним з найвідоміших художників в історії мистецтва і провідною фігурою в імпресіоністському русі.<br/><br/>У 1883 році Моне переїхав до Живерні. Тут він любив малювати на відкритому повітрі в садах, які він допомагав створювати. Водяні лілії, знайдені в ставку, мали особливу привабливість, і він намалював кілька серій з них протягом усього свого життя; міст в японському стилі через ставок став предметом декількох робіт.<br/><br/>У 1912 році Моне намалював серію з 12 картин на замовлення музею Оранжереї Тюїльрі в Парижі. Він вирішив зробити їх у дуже великому масштабі, і послужити "притулком мирної медитації". Цей проект поглинув більшу частину пізніх років Моне. Моне одного разу заявив: "Ці пейзажі води і відображення стали одержимістю для мене. Це за межами моїх сил, як старої людини, і все ж я хочу передати те, що я відчуваю."<br/><br/>Майже сліпий, з обома очима, серйозно ураженими катарактою, Моне, нарешті, погодився на операцію по хворобі в 1923 році.<br/><br/>Відомі водяні лілії Моне стали червонішими, коли його катаракта прогресувала. Після коригувальної операції він знищив більшість картин «червоної лілії», розсердившись, що ніхто насправді не згадав про це йому. За іронією долі, ці картини, ймовірно, зробили його імпресіоністичний стиль настільки відомим у той час - художники почали більше ризикувати кольором і так далі.<br/><br/>Шедевр<br/><br/>«Хлопчик, що сидить позаду тебе, каже, що ти схожий на шедевр.<br/><br/>Запитайте його, чи бачив він коли-небудь Моне зблизька?<br/><br/>Досить близько, щоб побачити нічого, крім плутаних штрихів бур'янистого берега озера?<br/><br/>Достатньо близько, щоб занурити пальці в гребені<br/><br/>де олійні фарби загартовані під поглядом художника?<br/><br/>Достатньо близько, щоб дихати кров'ю лілій?<br/><br/>Запитайте його, чому він пофарбував їх у червоний колір?»<br/><br/>Він усміхнувся, як чеширський кіт Керролла.<br/><br/>"Через затуманені і кровопролитні очі я уявляю.<br/><br/>Будьте моїми водяними ліліями!", - каже він.<br/><br/>"Відчуй моє дихання і нехай мої пальці копають,<br/><br/>Натомість він став моїм шедевром.<br/><br/>Ще ніколи пензлик не торкнувся полотна, настільки гарного, як ваша світла шкіра.<br/><br/>Нехай пани плачуть у заздрощах,<br/><br/>І Ван Гог розрізав собі вухо від заздрості до краси твоєї наготи.<br/><br/>Автопортрет з перев'язаним вухом<br/><br/>Вінсент ван Гог [Суспільне надбання], через Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Відповіді<br/><br/>Тепер ваша черга.

Отримати форматування, щоб виглядати прямо в електронній книзі, було найважчим, хоча ви просто введіть його в текстовий документ, і Lulu автоматично створює сторінку вмісту і перетворює документ в ePub або PDF, ви можете використовувати лише певні шрифти і повинні переконатися, що назви глав або заголовки віршів знаходяться в заголовку 1.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | По-перше, сам EEQT потребує подальшого розвитку, щоб забезпечити теоретичну та обчислювальну відповідь на потреби сучасної квантової інженерії та технологій. Ми повинні включити класичні системи з нескінченною кількістю ступенів свободи - як електромагнітне і / або гравітаційне поле. Ми також повинні включити нескінченні квантові системи, щоб зрозуміти і імітувати газ Бозе і його фазові переходи. Але є також кроки, які повинні бути зроблені далеко за межами парадигми EEQT.<br/>Як ми вже багато разів підкреслювали: квантову теорію ще треба розуміти в термінах «нелінійної класичної теорії». Але те, що ми маємо на увазі під «класичною теорією», є чимось набагато більш просунутим і загальним, ніж класична механіка або класична теорія поля. Під «класичною теорією» ми маємо на увазі, перш за все, теорію, яка не базується на ймовірності з самого початку; теорію, в якій ймовірності з'являються на більш пізньому етапі, отриману з теорії; можливо, отриману необхідним чином. Така теорія повинна не тільки конкретизувати математичні об'єкти та їх співвідношення, але й робити «прогнози».<br/>Класична теорія — це, зокрема, теорія, в якій можуть відбуватися дискретні події, події, які є «об'єктивними». Вони можуть бути подіями, які впливають в основному на фізичний шар, але вони також можуть бути «психічними подіями», змінами станів «свідомості»; якими б вони не були, навіть якщо вони пов'язані з розгалуженнями всесвітів, вони відбуваються.<br/>Такої теорії, яка охоплює квантову теорію, як ми її знаємо сьогодні, ще не існує, але ми можемо уявити її можливу форму. Ніщо не служить краще, ніж приклад, тому наведемо приклад того, як можна тлумачити таку теорію.<br/>Уявіть собі теорію, розроблену єдиною теорією поля Ейнштейна, але зі змінним метричним підписом, можливо, зі складною причинною мережею, кратною<br/>Ейнштейн-Розен [40] (див. також [41]) мости, часові петлі, недиференційованість, фрактальна структура, все це додатково ускладнюється змінною розмірністю простору і «часу» (див. [42]). Уявіть собі, що така теорія здатна вмістити всі чотири відомі нам фундаментальні сили, але вона також включає в себе додаткове поле, яке відрізняється від фізичних полів, і яке є нелокальним в тому сенсі, що воно не виживає, беручи макросередню межу, коли відновлюється причинно-просторова структура загальної теорії відносності Ейнштейна. Це додаткове поле було б місцем для "форм думки", і наша теорія зв'язала б ці форми думки з більш "фізичними" рівнями реальності. Сама концепція<br/>"час" виникне тільки в одній конкретній обмежувальній структурі. Ніщо не заважає теорії такого типу мати математичні структури, досить багаті, щоб вмістити свідомість і розум. Завдяки своїй складності, щільності часових петель, бульбашкоподібній причинно-наслідковій структурі, робити передбачення в такій теорії можливо тільки застосовуючи ймовірність -<br/>як це відбувається з системами, що розвиваються відповідно до детермінованої, але хаотичної динаміки. Квантова хвильова функція виникла б в такій теорії як ефективний спосіб прогнозування. Такий тип пояснення квантового індетермінізму був висунутий давно І. Дж. Гудом.<br/>Він припустив, що квантовий індетермінізм можна зрозуміти, якщо ми визнаємо, що окремі квантові події, які насправді відбуваються тут і зараз, також мають майбутні передові причини.<br/>Проблеск такої думки, можливо, з'явився Алану Тюрінгу, коли він написав своє знамените, вже цитоване речення: «передбачення повинно бути лінійним, опис повинен бути нелінійним».<br/>Теорія, що частково йде в цьому напрямку, розробляється Л. Ноттале<br/>[43] хто стверджує спостереження, приписані Фейнману, що «типові шляхи квантово-механічних частинок є безперервними недиференційованими». Потім він продовжує свій розвиток фрактальних просторово-часових ідей, щоб завершити: «Квантова поведінка стає, в цій теорії, проявом фрактальної геометрії простору-часу, так само, як гравітація є, в теорії Ейнштейна загальної (рух-)відносності, проявом кривини простору-часу.<br/>Ще один крок у цьому напрямку походить від роботи російських вчених - яка почалася з найоригінальніших ідей М. А. Козирева [44]<br/>і А. Сахаров [45], і розробляється в Москві, на Уралі і в Сибіру, див. наприклад [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Найкраще харчування і вправи для схуднення<br/><br/>Як зробити сніданок здоровим?<br/><br/>Вранці, як імператор, опівдні, як король, ввечері, як жебрак, - говорить відома прислів'я. Дослідження, проведене медичною організацією Endocrine Society, підтверджує ключове повідомлення, що лежить в основі прислів’я: воно показує, що сніданок відіграє більш важливу роль, ніж часто припускають. Вранці людське тіло фактично має більш ніж вдвічі вищу метаболічну активність, ніж в інший час дня: великий сніданок не тільки тримає вас ситим протягом тривалого часу, рівень цукру в крові та інсуліну також повільно підвищується. Апетит до солодощів регулюється, ми рідше їдимо закуски протягом дня. Тому сніданок не варто пропускати навіть під час дієти.<br/><br/>Звичайно, великий сніданок не означає, що ми повинні мати кілька круасанів з вершками горіхової нуги і солодкими млинцями на сніданок вранці. Сніданок є здоровим найкращим, коли він містить багато білка та клітковини, а також забезпечує вітаміни та мінерали. Хліб з цільного зерна або мюслі, вівсяні пластівці, фрукти та горіхи є постачальниками енергії, які корисні для вас і тримають вас наповненими протягом тривалого часу.<br/><br/>Той факт, що великий сніданок краще, ніж велика вечеря, не обов'язково означає, що сніданок необхідний для схуднення. Мета-аналіз, проведений в 2019 році, показав, що загальне щоденне споживання енергії людьми, які снідають, в середньому вище, ніж у тих, хто не снідає. Останні в середньому були трохи менше половини кілограма легше. Отже, згідно з результатами цього великого дослідження, вам не обов'язково снідати, якщо ви хочете схуднути.<br/><br/>Схуднути за допомогою правильної дієти - ось як легко покласти здорову тарілку<br/><br/>Здорове харчування в жодному разі не означає менше смаку. Свіжі овочі, риба або м'ясо як джерела білка та інші корисні інгредієнти викликають смак у горщику та посмішку на губах - в ідеалі також, коли ви ступаєте на ваги. Дослідження, проведене в США, показало, що люди, які готують власну їжу і свідомо мають справу з тим, що вони їдять, мають індекс маси тіла в нормальному діапазоні. Відвідування ресторану або фаст-фуд, з іншого боку, швидко заманюють вас в пастку цукру: часто немає ніяких ознак того, скільки цукру в салатних заправках, скільки жиру в картоплі було смажене або не оброблялося м'ясо.<br/><br/>Здоровий обід складається з трьох частин - найбільша частина складається з фруктів або овочів і повинна покривати половину тарілки. Чверть їжі повинна складатися з білка, тобто риби, м'яса або тофу. Інша чверть складається з вуглеводів і ідеально зроблена з цільнозернових продуктів. Важливо: не їжте на своєму столі в офісі, але стимулюйте свій метаболізм і в ідеалі зробіть коротку прогулянку до або після обіду.<br/><br/>Коли їсти, щоб схуднути?<br/><br/>Увечері слід зосередитися на легких прийомах їжі, які досить низькі вуглеводи. Це найменш імовірно, щоб викликати стрімке зростання інсуліну, що добре для нашого організму. Овочі, молочні продукти і горіхи, наприклад, добре підходять для цього.<br/><br/>Також слід бути обережним, щоб не повечеряти занадто пізно. Найкраще їсти до 7 вечора - тоді організм може розслабитися і підготуватися до ночі. Достатній сон важливий для здорового схуднення. Дослідження, проведене в США, показало, що люди, які спали близько восьми годин на добу, мали кращі жирові відкладення. Так що спокійна ніч! Дозвольте собі більше шести годин сну, щоб ви могли почати наступний день підтягнутися і освіжитися.<br/><br/>Втрата ваги без фізичних вправ - чи дійсно це можливо?<br/><br/>Було б так легко, якби вага мрії могла бути досягнута просто шляхом зниження споживання калорій. Але ви, напевно, знаєте мудрість, що дієта - це тільки одна сторона монети, а вправи - інша. Так що нічого не допомагає: одягніть свій спортивний одяг і ви йдете!<br/><br/>Той, хто, крім спортивної програми, такої як біг, ходьба або плавання, також дозволяє ліфту йти самостійно і піднімається по сходах, робить невеликий об'їзд або використовує велосипед замість автомобіля, також називає щось хороше. Навіть проста ходьба корисна для здоров'я. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Чому ми відкриваємо сервер додатків Anvil<br/><br/>Чому Open Source?<br/><br/>Нещодавно ми відкрили сервер додатків Anvil. Реакція спільноти була чудовою, навіть трохи переважаючою (так, кожна відповідь на це оголошення дійсно потрапила в мою поштову скриньку!). Ми вже включили купу цих відгуків у нашу версію 1.2. Але нас постійно запитують: "Чому ви відкрили таку основну частину вашого продукту?"<br/><br/>Навіщо взагалі це робити?<br/><br/>Anvil - це інструмент, який дозволяє максимально просто створити веб-додаток. Ми робимо це, дозволяючи вам створити весь додаток на одній мові, Python.<br/><br/>Простий хостинг є частиною цього.<br/><br/>Веб-платформа зламана, і Anvil - це наша спроба виправити це. І, оскільки існує така складність у розгортанні веб-додатка, хмарний сервіс був найкращим способом забезпечити простоту, яку ми хочемо. Таким чином, ви можете створити свій додаток в редакторі Anvil і зробити його живим в Інтернеті одним клацанням миші.<br/><br/>Але ми постійно чули від людей, які казали: "Це чудово, але..."<br/><br/>"...але мені потрібно запустити це на офшорній платформі без надійного доступу в Інтернет"<br/><br/>"...але я хочу запакувати свій додаток в IoT-пристрій, який я продаю"<br/><br/>або просто: "...але якщо я кладу свої яйця в цей кошик, як я можу бути впевнений, що я все ще можу запустити свій додаток через десять років?"<br/><br/>Це все хороші моменти! Хмарний сервіс не є правильним рішенням для всіх. Якщо ми хочемо обслуговувати цих користувачів, у них повинен бути якийсь спосіб отримати свої додатки з Anvil і запустити їх локально, під власним повним контролем.<br/><br/>Відкрите джерело: рятувальний люк, а не сидіння виштовхувача<br/><br/>Ми віримо в рятувальні люки, а не викидні сидіння. На конференціях нас іноді запитують: "Чи можу я експортувати це як додаток Flask + JS?". Звичайно, це було б можливо - ми могли б сформувати пакет сервера, компілювати клієнтський Python в Javascript і виплеснути класичний веб-додаток. Але це буде мати серйозні недоліки, тому що:<br/><br/>Не зручна їзда.<br/><br/>Генерація коду - це місце виштовхувача. Генерований код краще, ніж нічого - принаймні ви можете його редагувати! Але в той момент, коли ви редагуєте цей код, ви втрачаєте всі переваги системи, яка його створила. Якщо ви використовуєте Anvil через його редактор перетягування і Python в браузері, чому наші локально розміщені користувачі повинні використовувати vim і Javascript?<br/><br/>Отже, ми зробили це правильно: ми відкрили рушій часу виконання Anvil. Це той самий код, який обслуговує вашу програму в нашому хостинговому сервісі, і він представляє вашу програму так само. Ви можете редагувати свій код за допомогою текстового редактора, запустити його, а потім git штовхнути його назад в нашу онлайн IDE. Це не сидіння виштовхувача: немає вибухового переходу. Це рятувальний люк: ви можете вилізти і піднятися назад.<br/><br/>А як щодо нашої бізнес-моделі?<br/><br/>Anvil ніколи не мав на увазі бути однією з тих корпоративних систем з низьким кодом, які стягують з вас 20 доларів США / місяць за кожну людину, яка використовує ваш додаток. Anvil - це інструмент для розробників. Додатки, які ви розробляєте, - ваші. Надання вам можливості запускати їх на Raspberry Pi - це круто, але це не змінює нашу бізнес-модель.<br/><br/>Ми робимо те, що завжди робили: створюємо та продаємо інструмент для розробки, який значно полегшує створення веб-додатків. Ми надаємо хостинг для додатків Anvil. Ми пропонуємо всю платформу розробки та хостингу на сайті для корпоративних клієнтів. І, звичайно, ми пропонуємо безкоштовний план, щоб кожен міг використовувати Anvil для хобі або освітніх цілей - або почати щось будувати і подивитися, як це відбувається.<br/><br/>Ми відкрили сервер додатків Anvil для (відносно невеликої) кількості людей, які цього потребують, і надати кінцевий страховий поліс. Звичайно, ви можете створити додаток з vim і розмістити його самостійно, навіть не зареєструвавши обліковий запис у нас (у нас є документи, щоб показати вам, як!). Але редактор Anvil - це найпростіший у світі спосіб створити веб-додаток, а наш хостинговий сервіс - найпростіший спосіб його розгортання - ось що ми очікуємо від більшості наших користувачів. І ви можете будувати з упевненістю, знаючи, що відкритий код знаходиться прямо там, якщо вам це потрібно.<br/><br/>Спробуйте самі<br/><br/>Якщо наша філософія розвитку резонує з вами, чому б не спробувати Anvil самостійно? |
