| Abstract<br/><br/>There are an estimated 3.5 million mosques worldwide. The relatively large surface area of most mosque rooftops and their ubiquity in the Muslim world make them excellent candidates for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Muslims congregate for prayers at mosques five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because these times are governed by the sun, they change chronographically within the year, according to the season, but are perpetual. As such, mosque electricity load profiles are highly predictable across each year and experience limited annual variation.<br/><br/>Authors<br/><br/>Amro Elshurafa<br/><br/>Research FellowAmro is a research fellow with 15 years of research experience on three continents in the fields of technology and energy.

| Why are Explosion Proof Lights Different?<br/>(4/22/2010) When the conditions are right in any of these settings, the only thing keeping the unthinkable from happening is the lack of an ignition source. In an atmosphere that has become contaminated with volatile gases, or heavily saturated with combustible dust, all it takes is one tiny spark to set in motion a chain of reactions that can lead to fires, explosions, and injuries.<br/><br/>In many of these settings, it is in fact common for a flammable atmosphere to be present, and there is no practical way to completely avoid producing these conditions. Because these conditions are often created as a part of the normal operations of industry and cannot be totally negated, the next obvious solution is to remove all possible sources of ignition. Doing this is easier said than done, since in industry there are so many sources that must be considered. Everything from light switches to fans are possible sources of ignition, and they simply cannot be entirely removed the workspace. It's because of this that specialized versions of equipment that must be operated in these hazardous environments have been developed and are mandated for use in hazardous locations by OSHA.<br/><br/>Equipment for use in hazardous locations has several ratings and categories that indicate the suitability of the equipment for use depending upon the level of danger a particular location may create. For the control of ignition sources, most regulations deal in mandating either intrinsically safe electrical equipment, or explosion proof equipment. The differences between the two are subtle, but important. Intrinsically safe equipment is basically any equipment that is incapable of producing sufficient energy to cause ignition. Explosion proof refers to equipment that can contain and isolate possible sources of ignition, preventing them from making contact with the open air. It would seem obvious that intrinsically safe would be the highest safety rating, and in fact it is. Intrinsically safe rated equipment is suitable for use in all the hazardous location groups and ratings as defined by OSHA regulations. Despite this, intrinsically safe equipment is not always the best choice because of the limitations created by its higher costs and generally low power characteristics.<br/><br/>Explosion proof equipment on the other hand is not as constrained by the limitations imposed by the intrinsically safe rating, and allows for a broader and more powerful spectrum of equipment to be used, and at cheaper cost. Since the explosion proof rating only requires that sources of ignition be contained, and temperatures be kept below certain levels for varying division ratings, the basic design of equipment can remain intact, with additional design incorporated to contain its normally open sources of possible ignition. A basic example would be a simple light switch. In normal conditions, a light switch has at its core a contact point where two metal conductors are put into contact with each other to form a closed circuit, thereby transferring electrical energy to the lamp.<br/><br/>It is at this contact point that a possible ignition source is created as the two conductors come into contact with each other and produce a small spark or arc. Isolating this spark can be as simple as encasing the entire switch within a sealed and non conductive exterior such as rubber, thereby removing the conductive portion of the switch from contact with the outside atmosphere.This is a greatly simplified example, but it demonstrates the basic premise. To better understand the full premise behind making electrical equipment explosion proof, and just how much is involved in the design, it is better to look at something a bit more complicated.<br/><br/>One of the first things you'll note is how different this drop light's appearance is from ordinary drop lights. While the overall shape and design appearance is the same, it is somewhat stouter and much more rugged looking. This is due to the necessity of incorporating a stronger basic body assembly. As well as sealing possible sources of ignition from contact with flammable dust or vapors, the assembly must be able to contain any ignition of gases within its housing; if a bulb were to explode, or gases to get inside and ignite, the housing is capable of containing these long enough for them to cool below ignition temperatures before they can escape. In a traditional drop light, there is no sealing, and the assembly is a great deal less rugged.<br/><br/>The next thing you would notice is that the lamp is constructed of non sparking materials. The body is made from high strength composites, the metal cage and lamp housing is aluminum, and the cord is chemical and abrasion resistant. This allows the lamp to be accidentally dropped, and greatly reduces the chances that an errant spark is created when it contacts the ground. Further enhancing the safety of the lamp is a clear impact resistant enclosure that seals the bulb itself from the outside environment. The bulb and the enclosure are both protected from impacts by a strong aluminum cage, reducing the chances of damages from impacts. Traditional drop lights have little to no concern for the metals used in construction aside from production cost, and rely on thin steel and tin for most of their metallic components.<br/><br/>In this particular lamp, LEDs are used instead of a typical incandescent or fluorescent bulb. These LEDs create less heat than traditional bulbs, and produce a greater amount of light with less power. As well as being more efficient, the LEDs are also a great deal more resistant to damage from dropping or impacts. Traditional bulbs rely on a fragile tungsten filament to produce light through resistance to electrical current. This fragile filament is easily broken by vibration or impacts. As well as being easily damaged, a traditional bulb relies on a gas filled enclosure surrounding the filament to increase the life of the filament. This glass enclosure is also easily broken, and represents an ignition hazard if it breaks during use and exposes the hot filament to an explosive atmosphere. With the LED bulb, there is no gas filled enclosure to break, and no heated filament to present an ignition source. This has the effect of further improving this lamps resistance to creating an errant ignition source.<br/><br/>Lastly, you'll note that all the parts of this assembly are tightly and securely sealed together. Unlike traditional lamps, all the seams and connections are sealed with gaskets and fillers that isolate the internal electronics of the unit from the outside. Contaminants are kept out, and possible ignitions are kept in, removing the possibility of a chance ignition of the volatile compounds that may be present.<br/><br/>As well as being ruggedly designed and explosion proof, this lamp is also very energy efficient. The LED bulb uses a fraction of the power a normal bulb consumes. At only 7 watts, this LED lamp produces the light equivalent of a standard 100 watt incandescent. The life of the LED is significantly longer as well, with the LED bulb rated at approximately 50,000 hours of life, while a traditional incandescent is typically rated well below 5000 hours. This means less trouble and expense with replacing the bulb. As well as consuming less energy, the LED bulb produces far less heat. In a standard drop light, none of the above features are present. It is commonly understood that frequent bulb replacements and occasional burns from contact with the hot housing assembly are a part of using the standard incandescent lamp. Not so with LEDs.<br/><br/>As you can see, there is a great deal of consideration and design that goes into creating a high quality piece of explosion proof equipment. Although the basic premise is still to produce a simple and efficient source of illumination, the added requirements of an explosion proof rating increases the demands for durability and ruggedness. In these lamps provided by Larson Electronics, those requirements are met and exceeded. | Чому вибухонебезпечні лампи різні?<br/>(4/22/2010) Коли умови є правильними в будь-якому з цих налаштувань, єдине, що утримує від немислимого, це відсутність джерела запалювання. У атмосфері, яка стала забрудненою летючими газами, або сильно насиченою горючим пилом, все, що потрібно, це одна крихітна іскра, щоб привести в рух ланцюг реакцій, які можуть призвести до пожеж, вибухів і травм.<br/><br/>У багатьох з цих налаштувань, це насправді звичайне для горючої атмосфери, щоб бути присутнім, і немає ніякого практичного способу, щоб повністю уникнути виробництва цих умов. Оскільки ці умови часто створюються як частина нормальної діяльності промисловості і не можуть бути повністю заперечені, наступним очевидним рішенням є видалення всіх можливих джерел запалювання. Робити це легше сказати, ніж зробити, оскільки в промисловості є так багато джерел, які потрібно враховувати. Все, від вимикачів світла до вентиляторів, є можливими джерелами запалювання, і вони просто не можуть бути повністю видалені робочого простору. Саме через це були розроблені спеціалізовані версії обладнання, які повинні експлуатуватися в цих небезпечних середовищах, і призначені для використання в небезпечних місцях OSHA.<br/><br/>Обладнання для використання в небезпечних місцях має кілька оцінок і категорій, які вказують на придатність обладнання для використання в залежності від рівня небезпеки, яку може створити конкретне місце. Для контролю джерел запалювання, більшість правил мають справу з обов'язковим або внутрішньо безпечним електрообладнанням, або вибухозахищеним обладнанням. Відмінності між ними тонкі, але важливі. Внутрішньо безпечне обладнання - це в основному будь-яке обладнання, яке не здатне виробляти достатню енергію, щоб викликати запалювання. Вибухозахищеність відноситься до обладнання, яке може містити і ізолювати можливі джерела запалювання, запобігаючи їх контакту з відкритим повітрям. Здавалося б очевидним, що внутрішньо безпечним буде найвища оцінка безпеки, і насправді це так. Внутрішньо безпечне номінальне обладнання підходить для використання у всіх групах небезпечних місць та рейтингах, визначених правилами OSHA. Незважаючи на це, внутрішньо безпечне обладнання не завжди є найкращим вибором через обмеження, створені його більш високими витратами і, як правило, низькими характеристиками потужності.<br/><br/>Вибухозахищене обладнання, з іншого боку, не так обмежене обмеженнями, накладеними внутрішньо безпечним рейтингом, і дозволяє використовувати більш широкий і потужний спектр обладнання і за дешевшою вартістю. Оскільки оцінка вибухостійкості вимагає лише утримання джерел запалювання, а температури утримуються нижче певних рівнів для різних оцінок поділу, основна конструкція обладнання може залишатися неушкодженою, при цьому додаткова конструкція включає в себе зазвичай відкриті джерела можливого запалювання. Основним прикладом може бути простий перемикач світла. У звичайних умовах світловий вимикач має в своєму ядрі точку контакту, де два металеві провідники контактують один з одним, утворюючи замкнутий контур, тим самим передаючи електричну енергію лампі.<br/><br/>Саме в цій точці контакту створюється можливе джерело запалювання, коли два провідники контактують один з одним і виробляють невелику іскра або дугу. Ізоляція цієї іскри може бути такою ж простою, як охоплення всього вимикача всередині герметичного і непровідного зовнішнього вигляду, такого як гума, тим самим видаляючи проводячу частину вимикача від контакту з зовнішньою атмосферою. Це дуже спрощений приклад, але він демонструє основну передумову. Щоб краще зрозуміти, що стоїть за створенням вибухонебезпечного електричного обладнання, і скільки бере участь у проектуванні, краще подивитися на щось трохи складніше.<br/><br/>Однією з перших речей, яку ви помітите, є те, наскільки відрізняється зовнішній вигляд цього крапельного світла від звичайних крапельних вогнів. Хоча загальна форма та зовнішній вигляд дизайну однакові, він дещо міцніший та набагато міцніший. Це пов'язано з необхідністю включити більш міцний базовий корпус. Крім герметизації можливих джерел запалювання від контакту з легкозаймистим пилом або парами, збірка повинна містити будь-яке запалення газів у своєму корпусі; якщо лампа вибухне або гази потраплять всередину і запаляться, корпус здатний містити їх достатньо довго, щоб вони охололи нижче температури запалення, перш ніж вони зможуть вийти. У традиційному крапельному світлі немає герметизації, а збірка набагато менш міцна.<br/><br/>Наступне, що ви помітите, це те, що лампа виготовлена з не іскрових матеріалів. Корпус виготовлений з високоміцних композитів, металева клітка та корпус лампи алюмінієві, а шнур хімічний та стійкий до стирання. Це дозволяє лампі випадково впасти, і значно зменшує шанси на створення помилкової іскри, коли вона контактує з землею. Подальшим підвищенням безпеки лампи є чіткий стійкий до ударів корпус, який герметизує саму лампу від зовнішнього середовища. Колба і корпус захищені від ударів міцною алюмінієвою кліткою, що зменшує шанси пошкоджень від ударів. Традиційні спускові вогні майже не турбують метали, що використовуються в будівництві, крім вартості виробництва, і покладаються на тонку сталь і олово для більшості їх металевих компонентів.<br/><br/>У цій лампі світлодіоди використовуються замість типової лампи розжарювання або люмінесцентної лампи. Ці світлодіоди створюють менше тепла, ніж традиційні лампи, і виробляють більшу кількість світла з меншою потужністю. Крім того, що більш ефективні, світлодіоди також набагато більш стійкі до пошкоджень від падіння або ударів. Традиційні лампи покладаються на крихку вольфрамову нитку для виробництва світла через опір електричному струму. Ця крихка нитка легко руйнується вібрацією або ударами. Крім того, що вона легко руйнується, традиційна лампа покладається на газонаповнений корпус, що оточує нитку, щоб збільшити термін служби нитки. Цей скляний корпус також легко розбивається і представляє небезпеку загоряння, якщо він зламається під час використання і піддає гарячу нитку вибуховій атмосфері. З світлодіодною лампою немає газонаповненого корпусу, щоб зламати, і немає нагрітої нитки, щоб представити джерело запалювання. Це має ефект подальшого підвищення стійкості цих ламп до створення помилкового джерела запалювання.<br/><br/>Нарешті, ви помітите, що всі частини цієї збірки щільно і надійно герметичні разом. На відміну від традиційних ламп, всі шви і з'єднання герметизовані прокладками і наповнювачами, які ізолюють внутрішню електроніку пристрою зовні. Забруднюючі речовини зберігаються, а можливі запалювання зберігаються, усуваючи можливість випадкового запалювання летких сполук, які можуть бути присутніми.<br/><br/>Окрім міцної конструкції та вибухозахищеності, ця лампа також дуже енергоефективна. Світлодіодна лампа використовує частину енергії, яку споживає звичайна лампа. Всього 7 Вт, ця світлодіодна лампа виробляє світло еквівалент стандартної 100 Вт розжарювання. Термін служби світлодіодів також значно довше, світлодіодна лампа оцінюється приблизно в 50 000 годин життя, в той час як традиційна лампа розжарювання, як правило, оцінюється значно нижче 5000 годин. Це означає менше проблем і витрат з заміною лампи. Крім того, споживаючи менше енергії, світлодіодна лампа виробляє набагато менше тепла. У стандартному краплі світла жодна з перерахованих вище функцій не присутня. Загальновідомо, що часті заміни ламп і випадкові опіки від контакту з гарячим корпусом є частиною використання стандартної лампи розжарювання. Не так з світлодіодами.<br/><br/>Як ви бачите, є багато уваги і дизайну, який йде на створення високоякісної частини вибухозахищеного обладнання. Хоча основною передумовою все ще є створення простого та ефективного джерела освітлення, додаткові вимоги до вибухозахищеного рейтингу підвищують вимоги до довговічності та міцності. У цих лампах, що надаються Larson Electronics, ці вимоги виконуються і перевищуються. |
| Some photographers think a cloudy day yields better light than a sunny. It's true that sunny light can be a little difficult to contain but if you can harness it well, the results can be spectacular. This shoot occurred on a pretty dreary day but the light did yield some beautifully soft light that gave some of the objects a rich, buttery feel to them. | Деякі фотографи думають, що хмарний день дає краще світло, ніж сонячний.
