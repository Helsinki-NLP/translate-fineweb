In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Онлайн CPR сертифікації блог<br/><br/>Дата: 23 липня, 2014<br/><br/>Аутосомно-домінантна інтерстиціальна хвороба нирок — рідкісна сукупність захворювань, що впливають на відомі функції нирок. Простіше кажучи, стан характеризується: розвивається захворювання нирок і відбувається пересадка нирки та інші захворювання, пов'язані з кислою концентрацією в крові і подагри. Теоретично, стан буде відбуватися, навіть якщо генетична зміна успадковується від одного з батьків і спорадично відбувається, коли немає сімейної історії.<br/><br/>Загальні назви аутосомно-домінантної інтерстиціальної хвороби нирок<br/><br/>Цей стан також має інші назви, а саме: медуллярна кістозна хвороба нирок, хоча ця назва не використовується, тому що більшість людей, які страждають від цього стану, не мають медуллярних кіст. Це також називається ювенільною гіперурикемічною нефропатією. Захворювання має тенденцію вражати людей у віці від 20 до 50 років. Останній стан, як згадувалося вище, зустрічається у маленьких дітей, що-небудь, що перекладається, щоб отримати його від обох батьків.<br/>Кістозна хвороба нирок є успадкованим станом, при якому кісти в центрі кожної нирки поступово втрачають здатність функціонувати належним чином. Кістки відносяться до аномальних пухирців рідини в нирці. Цей стан ще більше лякає нирки, нездатні сконцентрувати сечу і, як наслідок, виробляючи занадто багато сечі. Його симптоми включають надмірне сечовипускання, тягу до солі, слабкість, плутанина, кровотеча, втома, часті гикавки, низький кров'яний тиск, нудота і блювота, головні болі, бліда шкіра, зниження відчуття в руках, втрата ваги серед багатьох інших. Інші ускладнення включають: анемію, виразки, втрату щільності кісткової тканини, безпліддя та інші проблеми, пов'язані з серцем.<br/>Його аналіз включає аналізи крові для перевірки рівня натрію та загальних функцій нирок, аналізи сечі для перевірки рівнів концентрації та інших дисбалансів, рентгенівські промені для перевірки розміру нирок, які можуть бути змінені через збільшення концентрації сечі, біопсію нирок та генетичне тестування для перевірки будь-яких генетичних змін, які могли відбутися вчасно.<br/>Хоча хвороба не має скорочення і сухе лікування до нього, можна зосередитися на контрольних заходів, які включають в себе прийом рідини і солі, щоб доповнити один втрачений, як хвороба прогресує в останні стадії. Це також допомагає зменшити зневоднення. Інші методи лікування включають в себе прийом призначених ліків і зміни в дієті і мінімальне споживання продуктів, що містять фосфор і калій. Подальші ускладнення можуть також вимагати пересадки нирки.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Розповідь Гоббса проти Локка про стан природи<br/><br/>Тема: ФілософіяСлов: 2539Сторінки: 9Серпень 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Гоббс і Локк є одними з найвпливовіших політичних філософів, які коли-небудь писали англійською мовою. Природний стан, який передує організації складних суспільств, є спільною передумовою, яку і Гоббс, і Локк поділяють, але інтерпретують по-різному. Перший розглядає людей у їх природному стані як однаково небезпечних і вільних переслідувати свої егоїстичні цілі, не обмежені неіснуючими поняттями справедливості, тому його природний стан дорівнює «війні кожної людини проти кожної людини» (Hobbes 76). Останній, з іншого боку, розглядає людей у їх первісному стані як однаково цінних і обмежує природну свободу ідеєю справедливості, яка вимагає не шкодити іншим, що дозволяє визначити стан природи як «взаємну допомогу і збереження», а не війну (Локке 15). Ключова відмінність між описами природного стану двох філософів полягає в тому, що Локк використовує етичні міркування, а Гоббс ні, і це в кінцевому підсумку призводить Гоббса до уявлення про державу, що здійснює необмежену владу над людьми, в той час як Локк обмежує уряд моральними принципами, які він вважає природним законом.<br/><br/>Гоббс засновує свої припущення про стан природи на тому, що всі люди приблизно рівні за своїми фізичними і розумовими можливостями. Він визнає, що деякі індивіди можуть демонструвати більшу фізичну силу або вищий інтелект, але наполягає, що «коли все рахується разом, різниця між людиною і людиною не настільки значна» (Hobbes 74). Оскільки люди приблизно рівні за своїми можливостями, вони також мають подібні надії на досягнення своїх цілей і задоволення своїх потреб (Hobbes 75). Як логічний результат цієї рівності, коли люди починають конкурувати за дефіцитні ресурси, ніхто не може відчувати себе в повній безпеці у своєму майні. Навіть якщо могутній, хитрий і здібний чоловік досягне успіху в підкоренні «особи всіх людей, яких він може», це все одно не гарантує остаточної безпеки (Hobbes 75). Оскільки жодна людина не може отримати такої переваги над іншими, яка робить його або її повністю невразливим до їхньої сили інтелекту, жодна людина не може відчувати себе в повній безпеці, коли її або її оточені рівними. Рівність Гоббса в природному стані — рівність страху, де всі люди розглядають один одного як небезпечних конкурентів.<br/><br/>Так само, як Гоббс, Локк вважає всіх людей принципово рівними, але присвоює цьому терміну зовсім інше значення. З його точки зору, це не рівність можливостей, а, скоріше, рівність цінності. Він вважає, що люди, «безтурботно народжені з однаковими перевагами природи», повинні логічно насолоджуватися досконалою рівністю між ними, оскільки немає ніяких підстав вважати когось за своєю природою більш цінним (Locke 8). Єдиною можливою основою для визначення одних людей як вищих за інших було б, якби Бог «яким-небудь явним виявом своєї волі поставив один одного над іншим» (Локк 8). Оскільки така божественна санкція вищості відсутня, Локк приходить до висновку, що природну рівність всіх представників людства не можна ставити під сумнів. Гоббс підходить до рівності прагматично і підкреслює, що люди в їх природному стані однаково небезпечні, але Локк використовує етичний підхід і підкреслює, що люди однаково цінні в очах Бога. Ця розбіжність є лише першою різницею між двома авторами, заснованою на тому факті, що Локк включає Бога як передумову в свою політичну філософію, в той час як Гоббс цього не робить.<br/><br/>Іншою характерною рисою Гоббса є його тлумачення свободи. На думку Гоббса, природний стан передбачає необмежену свободу робити все необхідне для продовження свого існування. Філософ визначає свободу як "відсутність зовнішніх перешкод" у використанні своїх здібностей для досягнення своїх цілей (Hobbes 79). Основна мета кожної розумної істоти - підтримувати своє подальше існування. Як наслідок, свобода Гоббса означає безперешкодну можливість робити все, що, на його думку, найкраще підходить для збереження свого життя і майна (Hobbes 79). Єдине обмеження свободи полягає в тому, що людина не може зробити нічого, що суперечило б підтримці її життя або знищенню «засобу збереження того ж самого» (Hobbes 79). Крім того, немає кордонів, і кожен має «право на все, навіть на тіло один одного», якщо це сприяє виживанню (Hobbes 80). Таким чином, природна свобода, на думку Гоббса, - це відсутність зовнішніх перешкод у здійсненні свого права на все, щоб підтримувати і забезпечувати своє подальше існування.<br/><br/>Локк також підтримує ідею природної свободи, але, що не дивно, підходить до неї таким чином, що істотно відрізняється від Гоббса. Як тільки він починає обговорювати свободу в природному стані, він відразу зазначає, що стан свободи не прирівнюється до «стану ліцензії» (Локк 9). Філософ виділяє два конкретних обмеження свободи людини в природному стані. Перша ідентична введеній Гоббсом: як би вільна і незалежна людина не «не має свободи знищити себе» (Локк 9). Однак друге обмеження прямо суперечить припущенням Гоббса. За Локком, кожна людина має природне зобов'язання "не завдавати шкоди іншому в його житті, здоров'ї, свободі або майні" (9). Так само, як і в своїй інтерпретації рівності, автор засновує це твердження на етичних і релігійних підставах: люди повинні зберігати існування один одного, оскільки всі вони є творіннями одного і того ж «всемогутнього і нескінченно мудрого творця» (Локк 9). Таким чином, Локк обмежує свободу в природному стані набагато жорсткіше, ніж Гоббс, вводячи зобов'язання утримуватися від шкоди як собі, так і іншим.<br/><br/>Розбіжності між двома авторами також проявляються в їх описах справедливості в природному стані людства. Що стосується Гоббса, то розмежування справедливих і несправедливих практик є лише питанням закону. У природному стані немає юриспруденції, і єдиним законом, що керує людьми в їх первісному стані, є природний закон, який зобов'язує їх лише шукати особистої безпеки. В результаті, ніщо не може бути несправедливим в первісному стані людства: «поняття правильного і неправильного справедливості і несправедливості» не мають місця і сенсу у відсутності суворо дотримуваного закону (Hobbes 78). Поки люди використовують свою практично необмежену свободу, щоб безжально конкурувати один з одним за ресурси, на які вони мають однакові права, у них немає критеріїв, щоб розрізняти справедливі і несправедливі дії. Тому гоббсівський стан природи кидає виклик самій ідеї справедливості, оскільки автор інтерпретує її як просту функцію формалізованого і встановленого закону.<br/><br/>Локк надає правосуддю різного значення і розглядає його не стільки в законодавчому, скільки в етичному плані. У цій статті вже згадувалося, що, на відміну від Гоббса, Локк використовує етичні поняття і, як правило, базує свою політичну філософію на моральних, а не чисто практичних припущеннях. Природний закон Локка, на відміну від закону Гоббса, зобов'язує людей піклуватися один про одного, а не просто залишати всіх на самоті. В результаті в його природному стані є місце для справедливості та несправедливості. Автор сам вказує на цей факт, коли зазначає, що ніхто не повинен позбавити іншого життя засобами його збереження, «якщо не буде справедливості щодо правопорушника» (Локке 9). Це твердження з максимальною чіткістю розкриває, що, на думку Локка, в природному стані існує справедливість, і, крім того, люди повинні її активно зберігати. Критерієм справедливості, якого бракує природному стану Гоббса, є друге обмеження природної свободи, накладене Локком: дія є несправедливою, якщо вона становить невиправдану загрозу життю і майну іншої людини.<br/><br/>Ці відмінності в трактуванні рівності, свободи і справедливості або несправедливості двома авторами завершуються їх тлумаченням зв'язку між станом природи і станом війни. З точки зору Гоббса, вони є синонімами, тому що безжальна конкуренція є єдиним логічним результатом розміщення людей з еквівалентними можливостями та подібними потребами в середовищі з обмеженими ресурсами. Він прямо заявляє про цей зв'язок: «Якщо будь-які дві людини бажають одного і того ж, але, тим не менш, вони обидва не можуть насолоджуватися, вони стають ворогами» і, отже, перебувають у стані війни один з одним (Hobbes 75). Однак, оскільки люди численні і всі володіють схожими можливостями і потребами, ця конкуренція проявляється не тільки в окремих взаємодіях, але і на рівні людства в цілому. Поки всі люди мають рівні і необмежені права на всі ресурси і навіть на тіла і життя один одного, природний стан є війною «кожен проти кожної людини» (Hobbes 76). Ця похмура інтерпретація прямо випливає з зображення Гоббсом природного стану, яким керують виключно егоїстичні потяги індивідів.<br/><br/>Локк, з іншого боку, розрізняє стан природи і стан війни і вказує, що, хоча вони можуть відбуватися одночасно, це не причина ототожнювати одне з іншим. Локкове визначення стану війни практично ідентичне тому, що пропонує Гоббс. За Локковим, «той, хто намагається привести іншу людину до своєї абсолютної влади, тим самим ставить себе у стан війни з ним» (14). Це пояснення ідеально узгоджується з уявленням Гоббса про те, що універсальне право кожного на все, включаючи тіла і життя інших людей, призводить до стану війни. Однак, Локк відмовляється ототожнювати стан війни і стан природи саме тому, що він заперечує інтерпретацію Гоббсом природної свободи. Оскільки природний стан Локка стримує людей від шкоди один одному через друге обмеження свободи, замах на свободу іншої людини є порушенням природного закону. У той час як для Гоббса війна є умовою людства за замовчуванням, Локк зображує її як збочення природного стану, а не його правління.<br/><br/>Ці відмінності в розмежуванні держави на природі та її складових, таких як свобода, рівність, справедливість та війна, прокладають шлях до контрастних зображень уряду. Спираючись на свою песимістичну оцінку стану природи, автор «Левіафана» приходить до висновку, що в умовах війни не може бути певної надії на «проживання часу, який природа зазвичай дозволяє людям жити» (Гобс 80). Рішення полягає в тому, щоб закласти універсальне право на все і залишити кожному « стільки свободи проти інших людей, скільки він дозволив би іншим людям проти себе» (Hobbes 80). Учасники отриманого суспільного договору вкладають необмежені свободи, які вони віддали, в суверена - носія верховної влади, метою якого є збереження досягнутого статус-кво шляхом покарання всіх порушень проти нього. Влада суверена абсолютна: правитель має право «робити все, що він вважатиме за необхідне», щоб сприяти миру між своїми підданими, щоб ніхто не нападав на чуже життя або майно (113). Гоббс приходить до висновку, що без такої неприступної фігури, яка має право робити що-небудь підданим, не може бути ніякого миру і ніякої гарантії безпеки.<br/><br/>Хоча Локк погоджується з необхідністю створення політично організованих суспільств, він, тим не менш, виступає проти ідеї Гоббса про суверенну владу як необмежену і неприступну. Як згадувалося вище, природний стан Локка не настільки жахливий, як намальований Гоббсом, тому що люди зобов'язані зберігати не тільки себе, але і один одного. Тому потреба у суспільному договорі виникає не від страху інших, а від простої зручності. Невеликі громади можуть не потребувати численних законів для вирішення конфліктів і «офіцерів для нагляду за процесом», але більші асоціації вважають доцільним створювати уряди для цієї мети (Locke 57). Однак влада уряду не може бути необмеженою, оскільки це призведе до підпорядкування підданих «непостійній, невизначеній, невідомій, свавільній волі іншої людини» (Локк 17). Такий уряд буде являти собою подвійне порушення природного закону. Погодившись на абсолютну владу іншої людини над своїм життям, суб'єкт порушить своє перше обмеження, що забороняє заподіяти собі шкоду. Що стосується правителя, то знищення свободи іншої особи буде прямою шкодою і, як така, суперечить другому обмеженню.<br/><br/>Як пряме продовження своєї справи про необмежену державну владу Гоббс заперечує поділ влади як принцип. З його точки зору, суверен, як тільки встановлено, володіє "всім правом приписувати правила", що регулюють життя підданих або, коротше кажучи, законодавчої влади (Hobbes 114). Суверен також залишає за собою право «слухати і вирішувати всі суперечки», тобто судову владу (Hobbes 114). Нарешті, оскільки вся мета суверена полягає в тому, щоб змусити підданих утриматися від заподіяння шкоди один одному, не може бути сумнівів, що виконавча влада є також його виключною прерогативою. Розділення повноважень як поняття є чужим Гоббсу через його погляди на стан природи. Створення політичного утворення, де виконавча, законодавча та судова гілки влади будуть перевіряти один одного, тобто конкурувати, означало б відтворення гоббсівського стану природи як війни на більш високому рівні. Оскільки люди вступають у суспільний договір і встановлюють уряд, щоб залишити природний стан позаду них, а не відновити його в іншій формі, поділ влади суперечить поглядам Гоббса безпосередньо.<br/><br/>Локк, з іншого боку, приймає розділення влади як основоположний принцип своєї політичної теорії. Його аргументи для розділення очевидні в обговоренні меж законодавчої влади. Як висловився Локк, було б навряд чи доцільно, «щоб ті ж самі особи, які мають право створювати закони, мали також право виконувати їх» (76). Філософ вказує на недосконалість людської природи і притаманне їй прагнення «схопитися за владу» як обгрунтування цього запобіжного заходу (Локк 76). Так само, як і у випадку Гоббса, розповідь Локка про поділ сил безпосередньо випливає з його інтерпретації стану природи. Якщо в природному стані вже існує справедливість і народ може її зрозуміти, то будь-який уряд неминуче підкоряється тому ж природному закону. Оскільки абсолютна влада над людьми порушує обидві межі цього закону, розділення і розповсюдження бажано, щоб уряд функціонував належним чином.<br/><br/>Ця стаття продемонструвала, що, хоча відмінності між Гоббсом і Локком щодо природного стану людства численні, вони в кінцевому підсумку зводяться до відсутності моральних передумов. Гоббс розглядає природний стан як стан необмеженої свободи, де люди, наділені рівними можливостями і не пов'язані ніякими моральними поняттями, такими як справедливість, безперервно конкурують за ресурси. Локк, однак, інтерпретує рівність і свободу етично, а не практично, і вважає, що війна є збоченням природного стану, оскільки природний закон зобов'язує людей не шкодити один одному. Ця незгода впливає на підходи філософів до управління. Гоббс наполягає на всемогутньому правителі, оскільки, за відсутності етичних обмежень, ніяка інша влада не може змусити людей утримуватися від шкоди один одному. Однак, на думку Локка, надання уряду необмежених повноважень суперечило б етичним обмеженням, вбудованим в закон природи, тому він, на відміну від Гоббса, виступає за поділ влади. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Поліція моди: яку гру престолів викинули<br/><br/>Канадсько-французький співак Аббас Хасан приклав сліпучі зусилля, щоб затьмарити все людство на Fashion Parade 2014. Нічого поганого в цьому немає, крім безпеки є пріоритетом, і музикант є небезпекою для здоров'я тут.<br/><br/>Ми розуміємо, що він хоче бути зіркою. На жаль, він не отримав записку, де вони розповідають відчайдушним і сумнозвісним, що зірка - це метафора. Ви не повинні виглядати як така і буквально підпалити наш погляд. Крім того, All Pakistan Aunty Association офіційно подала скаргу на нього. Місцевий ринок висох від підроблених кристалів і блискучих монстрів. Вони не мають нічого, щоб носити свої двотижневі високі чаї, і вони стверджують, що він винен. Мабуть, костюм натхненний «Грою престолів». Чи може він, будь ласка, дотримуватися написання сумних пісень про мертвого пса свого сусіда, а не концептуалізувати наряди? Або, можливо, це травма втрати собаки, смерть якої він явно не закінчив, оскільки він все ще носить свою тушу.<br/><br/>Зарядний аркуш Outfit<br/><br/>Ніхто не може вирішити, де починається наряд і де закінчується Аббас. Ви дивитеся в захопленні, занурюючись в глибоку безодню і дивуєтеся, чому він носить шкіряні штани. Чий кінь він вбив, щоб вкрасти сідло, задрафтоване через плечі? Чи був він у в'язниці прямо перед його появою на червоній доріжці і забув зняти ланцюги? Як він переживе синтетичну шкіру і висип пост-блестя, який обов'язково буде смертельним у такій високій дозуванні? Чому я все ще живий?<br/><br/>Ідея<br/><br/>Його натхненням була, здавалося б, Гра престолів, але в кінцевому підсумку він виглядав так, ніби його викинули з ресторану вікінгів. Якби він натрапив на будь-якого з персонажів шоу, він був би убитий в перші п'ять секунд першого епізоду.<br/><br/>Психічне здоров'я або його відсутність: Хтось отримати його до консультанта якнайшвидше! Він, здається, в припущенні, що носіння мертвої собаки означає, що єдиний друг, який він мав у своєму житті все ще живий. Дорогий Аббас:<br/><br/>1. Заперечення не є річкою в Єгипті<br/><br/>2. Ваша замучена психіка не допомагає вашій музиці, тому отримайте допомогу<br/><br/>3. Спробуйте уявних друзів<br/><br/>Відкупитися!<br/><br/>Всі ми в штаб-квартирі поліції моди серйозно травмовані. Аббас - це той, кого ми не любили заарештовувати. В даний час він перебуває під вартою і намагається помститися, одягаючи одяг з інших фантазійних шоу. Він просто блиск приклеїв себе, щоб виглядати як Едвард Каллен з Сутінки. Як повідомлення державної служби і для запобігання подальших нервових зривів, ми дали йому наступні приклади чоловіків з червоної доріжки тієї ж події.<br/><br/>Зохаїб Хассан<br/><br/>Коли сумніваєтеся, грайте безпечно. Співак виглядає як ваш середній дядько на шааді. Звичайний чорний костюм без аксесуарів, навіть якщо він трохи непропорційний, працездатний. Зовнішній вигляд Zohaib зливається з усім і нічим, і коли у вас немає почуття моди або грошей, щоб найняти стиліста, це нормально. Це не несе ризик зупинки серця для колег-відвідувачів на заході. Враховуючи делікатний психічний стан Аббаса, цей погляд - це те, до чого він повинен прагнути. Завжди і назавжди.<br/><br/>Алі Зафар<br/><br/>Одного дня, після десятиліть терапії, Аббас може прагнути носити одяг, як у Алі Зафара. Алі наблизився до того, щоб виглядати як метрдотель у французькому ресторані зі своєю білою літньою курткою з чорними лацканами, але сорочка зберігає його, не кажучи вже про атлас. Його штани були б смішними, якби вони не були складені на щиколотках. Взуття - це те, з чого зроблені хіпстерські шикарні щасливі закінчення. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Визначення гідравлічних властивостей грунту з різними рідинами для змочування: дисертація, представлена при частковому виконанні вимог до ступеня магістра наук в Університеті Лінкольна<br/><br/>Анотація<br/><br/>Гідравлічні властивості грунту, такі як гідравлічна провідність, утримання води та зв'язки води з рослинами, домінують у процесах руху води. Наприклад, інфільтрація, випаровування та потік води в грунті. Як поширене явище в грунті, водовідштовхуваність грунту змінює гідравлічні функції грунту, протидіючи надходженню води в грунт. Крім того, гідравлічні властивості не тільки залежать від порової системи грунту, але і впливають на фізико-хімічні властивості порових поверхонь. У порівнянні з водою, етанол не впливає на водовідштовхувальну здатність через його менший поверхневий натяг. Метою використання етанолу є усунення впливу водовідштовхувальних властивостей грунту на вимірювання гідравлічних властивостей. Однак застосування чистого етанолу в природному грунті може погіршити органічні матеріали грунту і призвести до зміни фізичних властивостей. Тому водні розчини етанолу можуть бути альтернативним варіантом. Тим не менш, доцільність використання водного етанолу для визначення кривої затримки рідини в грунті залишається невідомою. Це дослідження має на меті перевірити доцільність використання водних розчинів етанолу (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % і 100 % v/v) для встановлення кривої затримки рідини в невеликому діапазоні тиску в зразках грубого піску з різною змочуваністю і органічно зміненим природним грунтом (Templeton silt loam (TSL) з грибним компостом, біочаром, молочними стічнимиками і мусом. Результат показав, що десорбція тестування водних розчинів етанолу в порівнянні з водою була швидшою приблизно в 1-3 рази на основі вмісту рідини при тому ж тиску і часу досягнення кожної рівноваги. Результати експерименту з піском показали, що коли концентрація водного розчину етанолу була нижче 50%, втрати через випаровування становили менше 1%, а відносні відмінності між випробувальною рідиною та водою були нижче 10%. Однак втрати випаровування склали 11,06 % і 24,6%, а відносні відмінності склали близько 15 % і 30 % у 50 % і 100 % розчині етанолу відповідно. На відміну від цього, органічні поправки в суглинку Темплтона не тільки збільшили здатність утримувати воду, але й зменшили втрати випаровування. Втрати випаровування в грунті TSL і TSL з органічними змінами грунту були з 1% в розчинах з вмістом етанолу менше 50%. Втрати випаровування 50% і 100% етанолу склали 2,8% і 2,9% відповідно. Відносні відмінності між водою і випробувальною рідиною були подібними до експерименту з піском, коли концентрація випробувальної рідини була нижче 50%. Однак відносні відмінності в 50 % і 100 % розчині етанолу були меншими, ніж у зразку піску з приблизно 10 % і 15 % відповідно. Крім того, аналіз відносної різниці припустив, що майже всі водні розчини етанолу мали менший об'ємний вміст рідини при тому ж наданому тиску в порівнянні з водою, яка була відображенням водних розчинів етанолу, десорбованих швидше, ніж вода під еквівалентним тиском. Таким чином, від 10% до 40% розчинів етанолу можна вважати альтернативою для визначення гідравлічних властивостей грунту через їх більш високу швидкість десорбції і не впливають на водовідштовхувальні властивості грунту. Через випаровування і розчинення органічного матеріалу водні розчини етанолу вище 50% концентрації не підходили для грубого піску або середньо-текстурованого грунту. |
