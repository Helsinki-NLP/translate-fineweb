| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Бакопа<br/><br/>19 Мар 2015<br/>Опубліковано Doxiderol<br/><br/>Бакопа - багаторічна рослина, яка процвітає в болотистих субтропічних і тропічних регіонах по всьому світу. Високо оцінена трава є ключовим інгредієнтом Doxiderol, харчової добавки, яка підвищує когнітивну функцію. Бакопа була обрана за її здатність захищати мозок і збільшувати ацетилхолін, біохімічний месенджер, який дозволяє нервовій системі передавати інформацію.<br/><br/>Аюрведичні лікарі вперше описали терапевтичні властивості бакопи в 300 р. до н.е. Лікарі зафіксували здатність бакопи покращувати інтелект і пам'ять. Майже 2500 років потому, зростаюча кількість сучасних досліджень підтверджує когнітивні переваги бакопи, записані в аюрведичному тексті.<br/><br/>У 1987 році дослідники в Індії оцінили вплив бакопи на інтелектуальну функцію дітей шкільного віку. Під час чотиритижневого дослідження вони вводили бакопу 40 дітям у віці від 6 до 8 років. Вчені встановили, що бакопа підвищує сприйняття і пам’ять. Діти змогли вирішити вправи лабіринту швидше і точніше після прийому бакопи. Багато батьків в Індії регулярно використовують бакопу для підвищення інтелектуального розвитку своїх дітей.<br/><br/>12-тижневе дослідження, опубліковане в серпні 2001 року в журналі Psychopharmacology, досліджувало вплив бакопи на когнітивну функцію. Вчені випадково призначили здорових добровольців у віці від 18 до 65 років для прийому бакопи або неактивної речовини. Вони також використовували подвійну сліпу конфігурацію для дослідження, щоб приховати ідентичність продуктів. Дослідники використовують цей дизайн, щоб гарантувати, що результати тесту є дійсними, оскільки він усуває упередження дослідників та учасників. Група бакопа відчула значне поліпшення швидкості, з якою вони змогли обробляти візуальну інформацію. Учасники також навчалися швидше і зберігали нові спогади більш ефективно.<br/><br/>У 2007 році лабораторне дослідження Техаського медичного коледжу A & M виявило один з механізмів, відповідальних за здатність бакопи сприяти здоров'ю мозку. За словами вчених, бакопа використовує поліфеноли для запобігання окислювального стресу і шкоди, яку він завдає здоровим клітинам мозку. Бакопа також зменшує шкідливі відкладення речовини, відомої як бета-амілоїд, який є основним компонентом бляшки в мозку пацієнтів з хворобою Альцгеймера.<br/><br/>Подвійне сліпе дослідження, опубліковане в липні 2008 року в журналі альтернативної та комплементарної медицини, оцінило вплив бакопи на пацієнтів літнього віку. Дослідження підтвердило, що бакопа підвищує когнітивні показники при зниженні стресу. За словами авторів, переваги, досягнуті в цьому дослідженні, підтвердили результати більш ранніх досліджень.<br/><br/>90-денне дослідження, опубліковане в грудні 2008 року в журналі Phytotherapy Research, підтверджує когнітивні переваги, які раніше були продемонстровані в інших дослідженнях бакопи. Бакопа значно покращила здатність учасників тимчасово зберігати і використовувати інформацію, необхідну для виконання складного завдання. Подвійне сліпе дослідження також показало, що бакопа скорочує час, необхідний для обробки візуальної інформації.<br/><br/>На додаток до посилення передачі нервового сигналу, вчені теоретизують, що бакопа підвищує когнітивну функцію, зменшуючи тривогу. Численні дослідження показують, що тривога перешкоджає здатності виконувати завдання, які вимагають більш високого рівня когнітивних функцій, таких як навчання та запам'ятовування. Стрес порушує біохімічні месенджери та здорову передачу нервового сигналу. Бакопа полегшує стрес і відновлює відчуття спокою, збільшуючи рівень ацетилхоліну, що зменшує частоту серцевих скорочень і дозволяє робити більш глибокі вдихи.<br/><br/>Доксидерол є відмінним способом, щоб отримати переваги бакопа. Цей цілісний додаток також містить інші природні інгредієнти, які сприяють здоров'ю мозку і підтримати вашу здатність зосередитися і зосередитися на складному завданні, а також запам'ятати інформацію. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Вона також може відчувати демонічні аури, а також злі аури. Однак, коли вона народилася і росла, її сили були запечатані, і вона була набагато менш потужною.<br/><br/>ОЧИЩЕННЯ Здійснюючи фізичний зв'язок, Кагоме має здатність очищати як отруту, так і темряву від суб'єкта (живого та неживого). Для цього вона проєктує свої духовні сили через свою руку.<br/><br/>ДУХОВНІ БАР'ЄРИ З її повним потенціалом, Кагоме має здатність створювати бар'єр навколо себе і розширювати його навколо інших. Це куполоподібний бар'єр, який може знищити слабких демонів, які вступають в контакт з бар'єром.<br/><br/>ПІДВИЩЕНІ ОЧІ<br/>Кагоме має здатність бачити речі, які часто невидимі для людського ока: привиди, духи, божественні і злі аури.<br/><br/>МОЖЛИВОСТІ З ЗБРОЄЮ<br/>Кагоме має здатність використовувати лук і стріли. Вона була самостійно навчена, і після багатьох років практики її стріла рідко пропускає свій слід. Крім того, Кагоме має здатність наповнювати свої стріли силами. Вона може наповнювати стріли своїми духовними силами, що дозволяє їм проникати в демонічні сили, руйнувати заклинання та очищати об'єкти. Вона може наповнювати свій лук своїми силами та відбивати ворожі атаки. Вона має здатність наповнювати свої стріли очищуючою енергією для очищення отрути, а також потужними, далекими демонічними атаками. І, нарешті, у неї є можливість обійти інших своєю стрілою: якщо її мета знаходиться за бар'єром або заручником, стріла може телепортуватися і вражати тільки її ціль.<br/><br/>Решта її здібностей стали досить неважливими, оскільки вони пов'язані з подорожами у часі (через колодязь Пожирача кісток), коштовністю Шикона або її попереднім втіленням.<br/><br/>канону<br/><br/>Кагоме була витягнута через кілька днів після закінчення середньої школи, однак, до того, як криниця пожирача кісток знову відкрилася, щоб дозволити їй повернутися в минуле назавжди.<br/><br/>фрістайл<br/><br/>спогади<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Звук її імені був м'яким шепотом у задній частині її розуму, як дзвін, приглушений вітром. Це був звук далекого спогаду, голос, який вона почала забувати, але відчайдушно чіплялася за все те ж саме. Це був голос її матері, перекручений у смутку її загубленої дочки. Після всього, Кагоме вигнала без сліду. Вона живо пам'ятала ті моменти, як почався день, що вона їла на сніданок і останнє, що вона сказала своїй матері. Це було незламно, ці спогади, тому що це було, як і в будь-який інший час, коли вона проскальзувала між світами. Вона прокинулася, втомлена, тому що у неї не було мети поза школою. Вона могла знайти роботу і була запланована на співбесіду того дня. Серце її не було в ньому, але це було те, що вона повинна була зробити.<br/><br/>Вона пам’ятала почуття страху, висмоктуючи його і даючи собі підбадьорливу промову, що вона може зробити це. Що вона може прогресувати в житті, що вона повинна була тепер, що все було влаштовано в минулому. Звичайно, у неї було відчуття, що вона більше не належить ні своєму часу, ні своєму життю, а не всьому, що вона залишила.<br/><br/>Кагоме згадала відчуття дерева під її пальцями, як її рука скрутилася в ручку, щоб відкрити двері. Вона згадала, що вона зупинилася, обернувшись до матері з яскравою і яскравою посмішкою, коли вона струснула від свого ступору. "Я знімаю". Вона згадала, як сильний її голос звучав, посмішка на губах її матері, як її очі сяяли від гордості. Мати прощалася, що не виглядало інакше, ніж раніше, але якимось чином вага слів важче встановилася на плечах Кагоме, чим більше вона відображала.<br/><br/>Коротко кажучи, думки мерехтили вперед, цікаво, якщо її мати турбується про неї, сумував за нею, як вона. Кагоме міг відкрито визнати, що сила матері, її підтримка того, що її дочка так часто проскальзувала через час. Були моменти, коли вона вважала себе слабкою, тому що не мала жінки, на яку можна спиратися.<br/><br/>Проте, вона пам’ятала, що вона дійсно зібрала мізерну кількість сил. Вона могла запам’ятати зрушення в повітрі, температура помітно відрізняється від того, що вона очікувала, моргаючи раптовим і незнайомим оточенням. Це не була святиня її сім'ї. І коли вона повернулася, щоб повернутися, щоб пролізти через двері, через які вона пройшла, її зустріли з незнайомим і холодним металом під кінчиками пальців і інтер'єром, який не був входом в її будинок. Перед нею, за прилавком, стояв чоловік, який дивився на неї очима, такими ж широкими, як її власні.<br/><br/>Вона не панікувала, принаймні. Будучи розірваним у часі і поміщеним у неможливі ситуації, принаймні, створила вашу силу волі, доки не відбувалися дивні події. Тому що не кожен день хтось виявляв себе затягнутим у минуле демоном, з наміром вирвати з їхнього тіла могутній коштовний камінь, про який вони навіть не знали. А потім був факт, що вона розбила цю могутню коштовність, хто знає, скільки шматочків і було доручено знайти їх. Такі речі не були нормальними, і їй потрібно було зібратися з цим, як тільки вона зрозуміла, що це її реальність. Це здавалося таким простим, просто зібрати осколки і виправити коштовність.<br/><br/>Але це було нелегко, було багато демонів після осколків і самого коштовності. І один особливо сильний демон з бажанням, яке він вирішив побачити виконаним. До цього дня вона ніколи не дізналася його бажання, але знала, що це ніколи не було виконано, навіть коли він закінчив вибухову річ. Він зруйнував стільки життів заради нічого. Зруйнував стільки життів для такого марного завдання. Нараку була найважчим ворогом, і тим, хто був центром всього, що пішло не так у всіх життях її подруги.<br/><br/>Але, це була та непередбачуваність, та необхідність згортатися з тим, що відбувалося, і сила волі, яку вона отримала від своєї пригоди, яку вона пам'ятала, щоб придумати історію, яка вписувалася в момент, яка не здавалася занадто примхливою або надуманою. Йому треба було вірити, йому треба було вижити.<br/><br/>Врешті-решт, вона зіткнулася з гіршим, ніж чоловік у магазині фотоапаратів.<br/><br/>"Я шукав роботу." Зрештою, це не була повна брехня. Зрештою, вона вирушила зі свого будинку з наміром відвідати співбесіду. Стан її одягу, принаймні, підтвердить це. Це був один з найпростіших фіб, які вона коли-небудь розповідала.<br/><br/>І, з якоїсь причини, цей божевільний найняв її.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Кагомед перекинувся в ліжку, коли вона відсунула віддалені спогади, відмовляючись визнати, що вона дійсно прокинулася. Вона кігті при останніх проблисках сну, благаючи його повернутися і взяти її назад в свої обійми. Вона закривала очі, охоче спала, щоб прийти, і її зустрічали тільки спогади. Відлуння пісні співало вдалині її спогадів, пісні, яка часто мучила її, даючи таку ж назву, як і вона. Голос, який співав, більше не нагадував про її матір, а про голоси дітей, з якими вона часто грала, підростаючи. Вони відкликали спогади, хоча минули роки, як вона почала цей живий, хоча вона була щаслива в цьому житті, виклик цих спогадів був занадто гучним.<br/><br/>Раптом вона знову впала в них і сон ухилився від неї знову. Вона спостерігала за собою в обіймах своєї сім'ї, в той час як Інуяша була витягнута назад у криницю, дивлячись, як здивована, як вона відчувала. Спогади про той момент, ці почуття, були ще так сильні. Почуття розриву серця і смутку знову наповнилося, хоча це було так давно, коли вона відчувала, що вона була відірвана від усього, що для неї було важливо.<br/><br/>Звичайно, її сім’я мала велике значення, і вона була щаслива знову бути в їхніх обіймах. Вона все ще не могла пояснити, як вона відчувала себе розділеним надвоє, з воюючими бажаннями бути як в минулому, так і в сьогоденні. Вона згадала марні спроби стрибнути через колодязь, пальці, що клацають по землі в відчайдушному благанні, щоб дозволити їй повернутися. Перший місяць вдома вона не спала так багато, як плакала.<br/><br/>Елізіон прикрасив подібну реакцію, хоча вона була не така жорстока, тому що вона не знала точно, де вона проскользнула, і не знала, де вона може черв'яком повернутися. Вона не мала намірів залишатися, не мала намірів затримуватися довше, ніж їй було потрібно. І хоча вона не намагалася так жорстоко, як коли намагалася повернутися в минуле, її пристрасть була десятикратною, тому що вона не мала зв'язків з цим світом. Тому що вона була дійсно самотня ... без жодної надії на когось досягти її.<br/><br/>У свої ірраціональні моменти, вона думала, що коштовність відтягнув її назад і знайшов новий пекло для неї, щоб жити в. Новий пекло, який змусить її загадати бажання, але вона згадала дуже ясно, що вона хотіла, щоб це зникло назавжди. Це не зупинило її мрії, часи, коли вона прокинулася вночі, плачучи. І ці спогади про її минуле були найважчими, найважчими, щоб забути. Серце її почало панікувати, коли вона знову повернулася в ліжко, її дихання стало боротьбою, оскільки вона боролася з панічною атакою, викликаною її блукаючим розумом так пізно вночі.<br/><br/>Вона ненавиділа відчувати себе такою слабкою, такою зляканою.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Кагоме нарешті витягнула себе з ліжка, її кімната освітлена блідим світлом, якого було достатньо, щоб провести її до ванної кімнати. Вона стояла перед дзеркалом, раковина біжить, поки вона дивиться на своє відображення. Ворона пофарбоване волосся покрило її обличчя, і вона відчувала себе так погано, як вона виглядала. Перший ранок в Елізіоні був схожий на це, тільки вона була в гіршій формі.<br/><br/>Вона знайшла місце для сну, зумівши домовитися з власником будівлі, щоб дозволити їй залишитися невеликий період часу без оплати. Можливо, саме вплив Міроку дозволив їй укладати такі угоди, оскільки монах був відомий своїм способом зачаровувати (або обманювати) людей, щоб дати їм більше, ніж достатньо для роботи, яку вони зробили. Монах завжди був таким, оскільки вони вперше зустрілися. Він стверджував, що житло лорда переслідували, коли його не було, або, стверджуючи, що вони піддавалися нападу, коли вони не будуть. Він продасть свої підопічні та принади за такі високі ціни. Це спрацювало практично кожен раз, і вона дивувалася, чому люди були так готові довіряти йому.<br/><br/>Можливо, це була його посмішка, або той факт, що він був ченцем, якого люди минулого так охоче руйнували. Він ніколи не полював на слабких, принаймні. Він завжди робив те, що було правильним, і він був символом сили для неї в той час, коли він проштовхував все, щоб зробити те, що було правильним. Він проштовхнув через той факт, що він вмирає, що він був проклятий, і намагався зробити щось з цим, а не занурюватися в свою долю. Він підштовхнув себе до межі в часі, що передує їх останній бій. І вона була рада, що вони перемогли Нараку, перш ніж він міг піддатися тій же долі, що і його батько, і його батько перед ним.<br/><br/>Що стосується її власних чар, однак, вона була більш справедливою, ніж її друг, і зробила угоду розумною. Вона сумнівалася, що хтось у цьому світі заплатить величезну ціну за екзорцизм або вигнання демонів. Вони були занадто технологічно просунуті для цього. Але вона була досить розумна, і досить розумна, щоб зробити хорошу угоду.<br/><br/>Але тепер Кагоме була в кращому місці, хоча погляд на її обличчі виглядав так само. Привид, втомлений, виснажений ...<br/><br/>Швидкий погляд на годинник на стіні сказав їй, що вона може спробувати спати довше. Але вона відмовилася від цього, не бажаючи знову зіткнутися з спогадами. Замість цього вона прийняла душ, використовуючи холодну воду, щоб відганяти своїх демонів, наповнювати легені гострим вдихом і змушувати себе прокинутися.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Це не спрацювало.<br/><br/>Не так, як їй хотілося. Холодна вода, безумовно, змусила повітря в легені, змусила її розум прокинутися і м'язи захопити. Гіркий сміх був витягнутий з губ, коли вона нахилила голову назад і виявилося, що пам'ятає більше. Сьогодні вона не збиралася втікати від них так легко. Вона не збиралася одужати так просто, щоб одужати тільки тому, що вона цього забажала.<br/><br/>Іноді неможливо уникнути думок, які ви хотіли. Навіть коли ви були впевнені, що ви пройшли їх.<br/><br/>Санго була б великою допомогою в цій ситуації. Вбивця демонів був її найкращим другом, вона навіть пішла б, щоб назвати її сестрою, яку вона ніколи не мала. Старша сестра, яка була мудрою, завжди була на її боці, коли виникла біда. Особливо хлопчача біда, коли такі речі були досить тривіальними, але було весело мати закоханість і для її подруги збожеволів від її імені, коли Інуяша зробила її сумною. Зрештою, це було часто, що напівдемон буде бігти на бік своєї мертвої коханої і розбиває її серце не один раз.<br/><br/>Але Санго також надихнув її в інших відношеннях. Після всього, з чим стикалася жінка, вона завжди була такою сильною, такою впевненою ... Навіть у ті часи, коли вона сумнівалася в собі, вона завжди витримувала. Вона захоплювалася тим, що у неї є здатність вижити після втрати всієї сім'ї - нагадування про це часто підштовхувало Кагоме до виживання, тому що вона втратила всіх у цьому світі - а потім, коли її брат став пішаком Нараку. Це було нелегко, це не могло бути чимось, з чим будь-хто міг зіткнутися і все ще йти вперед. Вона все ще посміхалася, навіть з цим болем і цими нагадуваннями ... Вона часто була такою яскравою, навіть у темні часи.<br/><br/>І прямо зараз, вона хотіла нахилитися на бік старшої жінки, щоб втішитися тим, що вона була там, і вона підтримувала. Вона відчувала, що Санго якось пройде через це, і запропонує кілька слів сили і розуміння. Це були такі часи, які погіршили ці заклинання, постійне нагадування про те, що вона була без своєї сім'ї.<br/><br/>"Я не хочу бути на самоті." Вона кричала вголос у своїй самоті, звук душі заглушити благання.<br/><br/>Вона не боялася визнати це.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Ще годину минула, перш ніж вона це усвідомила. У неї була холодна шкіра від води, і відчувалося, що лід протікає по її венах. Вона не розуміла, що почала тремтіти, поки її рука не простягнулася, щоб вимкнути воду і закінчити душ. Кагоме знову не шукала власного погляду в дзеркало, замість цього вона загорнулася в рушники і витягнулася з ванної кімнати, по сходах і в свою кухню. Вона почала готувати легкий сніданок, бездіяльно читаючи свої нотатки протягом дня, коли готувалася їжа.<br/><br/>Останніми роками її кар'єра стрімко зростала. її фотографії були представлені в багатьох галереях, її ім'я стало часто зустрічатися у багатьох губах для тих, хто цікавився фотографією.<br/><br/>Робота, яку вона попросила за примхою, розпалила все це. Вона була набагато більш щасливою, ніж вона очікувала, щоб бути в цьому світі. Ніколи не пощастило, щоб прослизнути назад через тріщини в свій власний світ, але досить пощастило, щоб зробити добре. Коли вона повернулася до печі, вона згадала час, коли вона, нарешті, відмовилася від повернення додому. Це було близько двох років в її житті тут, як вона почала ризикувати в фотографії більше, ніж просто хобі, але те, що вона могла б зробити собі ім'я.<br/><br/>Цей день був особливо приємним, сонце було високо в небі, і вона виявила, що робить кілька фотографій природних пейзажів. Маленький хлопчик сховався в одному з рослин, і вона схопила фотографію того моменту, коли його обличчя оселилося в веселій, огидній посмішці за мить до того, як він вистрибнув, щоб налякати свою здобич. Це нагадало їй про Шиппоу, маленького кіцуне, якого вона, по суті, усиновила. Він теж був відірваний від своєї сім’ї, коли вони вперше зустрілися. Його батько вбив, і він вирішив помститися за нього. У молодості він здавався таким зрілим під час перших зустрічей.<br/><br/>Можливо, саме вплив Інуяші дозволив набору знову поводитися як дитині, бути молодим і примхливим часом, в той час як інші були більш зрілими. Він запропонував їй потіху по-своєму, і вона намагалася піклуватися про нього, як вона буде її власним, хоча вона була така молода, а також. Однак, її молодість не заважала їй зрозуміти, як доглядати за ним або піклуватися про нього, як її дитина. Серце її роздулося, коли він посміхнувся, коли він був так щасливий за свій подарунок олівців і взяв час, щоб зробити мистецтво. Вона була так горда за кожен малюнок, що він закінчив, що вона знала, що це, як мати буде відчувати себе в такій ситуації.<br/><br/>Біль, який пронісся через неї, був надто сильним, надто раптовим. Вона сумувала за ним і хотіла побачити, наскільки він виріс з тих пір, як її не стало. Вона так сумувала...<br/><br/>Щоб уникнути подальшого болю, будь-яких помилкових надій... вона здалася і зосередилася на покращенні себе.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Сніданок був смачним, нудним і натхненним. Тільки після того, як вона закінчила, вона зрозуміла, що забула про будь-які спеції або аромат їжі. Було занадто пізно, щоб згадати про це, оскільки її розум був занадто зайнятий, згадуючи інші деталі її життя, які явно стали важливішими, ніж її їжа.<br/><br/>«Сідай!»<br/><br/>Звичайно, нічого не сталося, коли вона сердито кричала на одного особливо розчаровує клієнта, який нагадував їй про напівдемона. Він був особливо впертим і грубим, бажаючи, щоб фотографія зроблена його шлях, а не дозволяти йому працювати природно. Ви могли б спробувати змусити диких тварин вести себе так, як ви хотіли. Але, рідко хтось досягав успіху з силою. Інуяша не був таким поганим, однак. Інуяша навчився, перш ніж вона була змушена подалі від нього. Він став ніжнішим, розумнішим, зрілішим, хоча були часи, коли він був ще дитячим і зухвалим.<br/><br/>Вона пам'ятає, як горіли її червоні щоки, але як вона вистояла і звільнила його. Вона сказала йому, що відмовилася працювати на кого-небудь або з ким-небудь, хто хотів викрутити щось за межами своєї природи, за межами власних бажань.<br/><br/>Вона повинна була порівняти чоловіка з Нараку, а не з Інуяшою. Хоча її клієнт не мав таких екстремальних намірів. Принаймні відчуття після цього було приємним спогадом. Свобода знати, що вона зайшла так далеко, що може відмовитися від роботи, яку вона не хотіла робити, бути своєю особистістю, незалежною від інших. Вона могла сказати, що зробила це в той момент. Незважаючи на те, що через кілька днів вона почула чутки зі словами, призначеними для наклепу на неї.<br/><br/>Вона захищала себе праведно, так само, як і наприкінці своєї подорожі.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Ранкове світло почало проникати в її будинок, знову нагадуючи їй про хід часу. Знову ж таки, вона розглянула список речей, які вона повинна була зробити, і обговорювала, з чого почати. Або, якщо вона взагалі повинна почати. З того, як почався день, вона не знала, чи може вона вважати, що це чудова ідея. Було сумнівно, що вона буде успішною з тим, наскільки загубленою в собі вона стає.<br/><br/>Вона не хотіла зіпсувати свою останню роботу. Тому що вона робила це кілька разів раніше. Неприємно було намагатися оговтатися від повної катастрофи.<br/><br/>Кагоме запам'ятала відчуття своєї дорогої, абсолютно нової, камери, що вислизає з її рук. Вона не була готова підтримати це, тому що вона щойно зняла його зі своєї сумки. Частина її кричала зсередини. Драматичний, надто, повний крику, який вона часто робила, коли вона була набагато, набагато молодша. Коли вона з усіх сил намагалася пройти через середню школу, стрибаючи між часами. Інша її частина залишилася замороженою, в той час як її об'єктив повністю розбився, а решта камери зламалася разом з ним.<br/><br/>Побачити брата Інуяші, повний демон, стоячи перед нею, було останнім, що вона очікувала, коли вона зробила свій вихід для її фотографій. Він стояв так само гордий, як і завжди, високий, як і завжди, так накладні, як вона пам'ятає. Він зовсім не виглядав збентеженим, щоб бути в зовсім іншому світі, хоча вона ніколи не була кращою в читанні його розуму. Його ім'я на губах було настільки потужним, що вона могла запам'ятати найдрібніші почуття, як вона. Губи її були потріскані, рот відчував сухість, а бурхливе відчуття тривоги в животі змушувало її відчувати себе хворою.<br/><br/>Вона не хотіла, щоб її надії згасали.<br/><br/>Але, вона хотіла, щоб він був там, навіть якщо вони не були друзями. Вони були союзниками, якщо щось, оскільки вони боролися пліч-о-пліч. І щось було краще, ніж абсолютно нічого.<br/><br/>І у Кагоме було достатньо розуму, щоб не кидатись на нього, щоб обгорнути свої руки навколо нього з полегшенням, що знаючи, що вона не самотня. Вона пам’ятала, що нічого іншого не має значення протягом багатьох днів, оскільки вона проводила час з ним, не говорячи про їх світ, а розмовляючи (або, вона говорила, і він просто визнав цей факт).<br/><br/>Коли, точно, вона впала на нього, хоча... Кагоме не міг пригадати. Це була тонка річ, так само, як він. Але вона знала, що почуття було. І він дав їй знати, що вона не одна в тому, що вона впала, що почуття якось розквітло.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>Почуття невагомості охопило її, і раптом її очі відкрилися, в той час як її розум відчайдушно кігті для останнього, що вона робила. Вона не пригадувала, коли вона заснула на дивані, але вона знала, що останнє місце, де вона була, було на надто зручних подушках. Однак вона не боролася і не боролася з невагомістю, як вона була в знайомих руках. Голова її нахилилася до грудей Сесшумару, втішившись тим, що він був тут і вона була не одна.<br/><br/>"Ласкаво просимо назад". Його відповідь була м'яким гуком у знак визнання. Йому не потрібно було багато говорити, щоб вона зрозуміла його намір, або решту того, що він повинен був сказати.<br/><br/>Він поніс її назад до її ліжка, влаштував її в ньому з легкістю. її очі зустріли його, і вона легко посміхнулася, тому що більше ніякі спогади дрейфували назад, ніякі спогади дражнили її. Ні, коли він був поруч, вона ніколи не впадала назад в ці думки. Він допомагав, і роки допомагали. Сьогодні був просто... один з тих днів.<br/><br/>"Спи." Він наказав з легкістю, її очі закотилися на нього, але вона не боролася, тому що вона втомилася. Рука її міцно притиснулася до нього, в той час як вона відчувала, що його протилежна рука притискається до її чола в оцінці її благополуччя.<br/><br/>"Я в порядку", - сказала вона, її слова тверді з її обіцянкою.<br/><br/>Вона була жива і щаслива.<br/><br/>Контакти<br/><br/>вантажовідправник<br/><br/>резюме<br/><br/>Кагоме, в якийсь момент свого життя, була досить звичайною дівчиною-підлітком, поки на неї не напав демон в будинку її сім'ї. Демон затягнув її в колодязь, який чарівним чином переніс її близько 500 років в минуле. Там вона дізналася, що в її тілі був священний коштовний камінь, оскільки вона була реінкарнацією жриці, яка померла за 50 років до того, як її затягнули. Драгоценний камінь був вирваний з її тіла, і демон, який тягнув її через час, був переможений напівдемоном, якого вона звільнила, який був прикріплений до дерева. Кагоме подружився з напівдемоном, Інуяшею, в часі і подорожував з ним, щоб відновити коштовність, яку вона сама розбила. Хоча це було не так просто і легко зробити, як багато демонів і людей шукали коштовність для своїх власних цілей. Вона подружилася з молодим демоном Кіцуне, монахом і винищувачем демонів, який подорожував з нею, щоб відновити коштовність.<br/><br/>Однак її група не була єдиною, щоб завершити коштовність. Замість цього, злий напівдемон, який маніпулював більшістю основних подій у більшості житті свого супутника. Коли він, нарешті, зібрав всі шматки коштовності і загадав своє бажання на зіпсованому об'єкті, Кагоме був втягнутий в саму коштовність з наміром, щоб вона зробила егоїстичне бажання тримати її в пастці назавжди, зберігаючи коштовність живою. Саме впертість Інуяші зуміла врятувати її від темряви. Зрештою, вона повернулася в свій природний час, закінчила середню школу, як і очікувалося від дівчини своєї лінії часу. Хоча через кілька днів Кагоме опинився в Елізіоні. Вона живе в цьому світі вже п'ять років, і вже давно відмовилася від повернення додому. Вона щасливо влаштувалася в своє нове життя.<br/><br/>платонічний<br/><br/>Для Кагоме досить легко завести нових друзів, вона не сильно змінилася з юності. Вона весела молода жінка, яка співчутлива і вітає найбільше в своєму житті. У молодості вона дружила з демонами, коли більшість їх боялася. Навіть демони, які раніше їли людей, вона подружилася, і вона змінила свої способи (вона хотіла б думати). При цьому дуже легко стати її другом, якщо хтось здатний показати, що вони готові бути викуплені, або показати, що вони не зовсім злі. Вона дуже переживає за всіх, кого зустрічає, тому їй важко не бути притягнутою до інших у бажанні бути друзями.<br/><br/>антагоністичні<br/><br/>Єдиний спосіб заслужити гнів Кагоме - це бути настільки жалюгідним, настільки злим і настільки далеким від викуплення, що вона не може бачити в вас нічого доброго. І вона може бачити добро майже у всіх і у всьому. Чесно кажучи, з ким вона стикалася? Напівдемон, який натравив двох коханців один на одного, який прокляв всю чоловічу лінію однієї з її подруг, а потім змусив брата її найкращої подруги вбити їх сім'ю... Так, я не бачу, щоб вона ненавиділа нікого без них дійсно, дійсно працювала на це. Але не соромтеся дати йому постріл.<br/><br/>романтичний<br/><br/>Коли в любові, Kagome є сильною підтримкою, завжди залишаючись там, навіть коли речі можуть бути грубими. Однак Kagome не шукає любові, не шукав любові, коли вона прибула, тому будь-які минулі відносини не існують. Це не означає, що хтось не закохався в неї. Вона, безумовно, може бути предметом чиєїсь нерозділеної любові, вона, ймовірно, буде забувати про це. Нарешті, Кагоме в даний час заручений з Сессумару, що дивно. Я повністю відкритий до потенційних речей. <3<br/><br/>фандом пекло<br/><br/>вік стародавній<br/><br/>види Космічна королева<br/><br/>Окупація вмирає<br/><br/>віддає перевагу їй<br/><br/>нагороди<br/><br/>pro вона / її est 62woo я смоктати на сюжетні відповіді. але в будь-якому випадку ОК!!!

Відверто кажучи, вона ще не пройшла через все, оскільки вона, по суті, була на чолі повномасштабної війни. Я відчуваю, що вони могли б бути друзями, оскільки Коррін досить відкрита в своїй особистості, а також надзвичайно довірлива. Вона просто... ховається і бореться через багато.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Чому ви повинні бути в Twitter<br/><br/>Відмова від відповідальності: Я не є і ніколи не стверджував, що є гуру соціальних медіа. Я просто людина, яка багато думає про речі, і це з'явилося кілька разів.<br/><br/>Я не є раннім усиновлювачем. Іноді мені потрібні роки, щоб з'ясувати, для чого я хочу використовувати щось, перш ніж я насправді потраплю в нього, і Twitter був однією з цих речей. Я серйозно займаюся Twitter приблизно з лютого цього року, тому я досить новачок у цьому. Тим не менш, я дізнався кілька речей, і я хотів поділитися ними. Деякі люди кажуть, що я штовхач Twitter, і я, тому що є багато вагомих причин, щоб потрапити на нього, і практично немає мінусів.<br/><br/>Отже, що таке Twitter? Якщо ви в Інтернеті, ви, мабуть, принаймні чули про нього. Це соціальна мережа, яка служить форумом для розмов, оновлень та новин у середовищі, більш публічному, ніж щось на кшталт Facebook або LinkedIn. Facebook - це про те, хто хоче вас знайти, але Twitter - це про те, кого ви хочете знайти. Ваші улюблені письменники, актори, політики, співаки та вчені, ймовірно, на Twitter. Так само ваші улюблені благодійні організації, радіостанції, новинні сайти та магазини. І вони хочуть, щоб ви знайшли їх і прислухалися до того, що вони говорять. Кожен у Twitter, принаймні спочатку, хоче поговорити з вами.<br/><br/>Але навіщо приєднуватися до цього? Навіщо бути частиною цього? Є всілякі причини, і я дам вам кілька.<br/><br/>Люди та місця Twitter - це чудовий спосіб дізнатися про події, які відбуваються у всьому світі, а також у вашій спільноті. Якщо ви подорожуєте і шукаєте, чим зайнятися, це відмінний спосіб дізнатися про речі, що стосуються ваших інтересів (тому що люди, за якими ви слідкуєте, - це люди, які вас цікавлять). Навіть якщо ви не подорожуєте, знаючи про чудові місця, щоб піти на місцевому рівні або знаючи, що люди ви зацікавлені в них створює можливість зустрітися з ними і створити більш глибокі відносини з ними. Якщо ви повернетеся до моєї вечірки, всі люди в ньому, крім двох, я чув про це в Twitter, а потім зустрівся в реальному житті, і тепер ми досить хороші друзі. І чим більше ви це робите, тим більше речей ви дізнаєтеся, і тим більше людей ви зустрінете. І якщо ви слідкуєте за ними у Твіттері, ви вже знаєте трохи про те, які вони. Вони хочуть, щоб ви. Зворотне також вірно, тому що твітінг запрошує людей побачити, які ви, і вони можуть зробити той же вибір про вас.<br/><br/>Натхнення і мотивація<br/>Натхнення приходить з найдивніших місць, і наплив твітів означає, що завжди є свіжий контент для вашої уяви. У мене є перша політика, тому я буду стежити за будь-ким, а потім періодично проходити і відписуватися від людей. Я не знаю, хто збирається посадити насіння нового повідомлення в блозі або нового проекту в мене, тому мені подобається тримати свої варіанти відкритими. Мотивація також відбувається, тому що Twitter так само, як життя. Якщо ви оточуєте себе людьми, які амбітні, самовіддані, щедрі і працьовиті, легше бути таким і підштовхувати себе. Легше думати, що якщо вони можуть планувати події, запускати проекти або просто вставати вранці, ну, так і ти можеш.<br/><br/>Навчання та спосіб життя Блогери на Twitter. Блогери, які насправді не можуть бути божевільними. І люди блог про все. Якщо ви хочете дізнатися щось, шанси хороші, що хтось твітить про це. Крім того, новинні сервіси та магазини також підключені, а це означає, що ви можете отримувати новини до хвилини та дізнаватися про продажі та пропозиції, коли вони починаються. Що стосується способу життя, шукаючи нові ідеї рецептів? Слідкуйте за деякими провайдерами і подивіться, що вони придумують. Чи потрібен поворот для цієї коктейльної вечірки? У Twitter є люди для цього теж. Рекомендації з гардеробу або просто хочете побачити, що інші люди роблять зі своїм життям? Це все там.<br/><br/>Є деякі загальні проблеми, з якими я стикаюся, коли говорю про це, і вони є законними перешкодами. Це може здатися досить складним, особливо якщо ви запізнюєтесь, як я. Я провів місяці слідуючи тільки за двома людьми і не знаючи, що ще робити. Але є способи подолати їх, і чую, що вони від найменш часто до більшості.<br/><br/>Твіттер для нарцисичних придурків<br/>Я думаю, що це походить від ідеї, що більшість людей твітнуть за і про себе, як спосіб привернути увагу. Що я не розумію, чому в цьому щось не так, або чому це робить людину нарцисом або придурком. Якщо комусь є що сказати, вони хочуть, щоб їх почули. Раніше ви стояли на розі вулиці і кричали. Тепер ви можете кричати 140 символів або менше. Twitter - це просто новий спосіб бути почутим. Тепер, безумовно, є нарцисичні ривки в Twitter. Вони майже всюди. Іноді, люди - придурки. Іноді один з цих людей - це я, мені шкода говорити. Не слідуйте за цими людьми. Якщо вам не подобається те, що хтось говорить, будь то пункти, які вони роблять, або детальні звіти про свою діяльність у ванній кімнаті, вам не потрібно слухати в Twitter.<br/><br/>No2: Я не можу стежити за всім<br/>Друга перешкода, яку люди часто піднімають, полягає в тому, що у них просто немає часу, щоб відстежувати всі речі, які відбуваються в Twitter. І знаєте що? Це нормально. Стежте за тим, що ви можете. Може бути, ви тільки блукаєте кожні кілька днів. Якщо ви приватний користувач (а не твіти для вашої компанії), і особливо новачок, це нормально. Частина чогось краще, ніж нічого.<br/><br/>No1 У мене немає нічого, що я хочу викласти там<br/>Це, безумовно, найчастіший виклик, який люди піднімають. І це навіть не має значення. Вам не потрібно приєднатися до Twitter, щоб говорити. Приєднуйтесь до нього, щоб слухати. Знову ж таки, ваші улюблені автори, співаки, блогери та газети тут. Це ваш шанс послухати їх. Це ваш шанс отримати вікно в їх життя і діяльність, і вони запрошують вас зробити це. Хочете дізнатися, що Felicia Day збирається зробити на San Diego Comic Con? Зроблено. Я знаю людей, які слухають тільки Twitter, і це чудово. Це те, що я робив деякий час. Зрештою, можливо, ви знайдете щось, про що можна твітнути, або зробите щось, про що можна твітнути. Я сподіваюся, що ви це зробите, тому що я хочу почути про це.<br/><br/>Коротше кажучи, якщо ви не використовуєте Twitter, я думаю, що ви повинні. Якщо ви не використовуєте його в повному обсязі, спробуйте. Не бійтеся стежити за п'ятьма сотнями людей, якщо всі ці люди говорять те, що вас цікавить. Запросіть цих людей до частин вашого життя, і подивіться, як це покращується взаємодією. Я з нетерпінням чекаю від вас. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | кореневих каналів<br/><br/>Сама думка про отримання кореневого каналу ставить більшість людей на край. SCM Dental використовує новітні технології та методи, щоб зробити кореневий канал практично без болю і низький стрес процедури.<br/><br/>Ротаційна ендодонтія є передовою технологією та технікою для виконання ендодонтичного лікування, клінічний термін для кореневого каналу Термін «кореневий канал» відноситься до природної порожнини в центрі зуба. Нерв зуба знаходиться в м'якій тканині (пульпі) всередині кореневого каналу. Якщо зуб пошкоджений травмою або розпадом, уламки можуть потрапити в чутливу область кореневого каналу і викликати інфекцію, або в екстремальних обставинах і абсцес. Абсцесований зуб дуже серйозний і повинен розглядатися як надзвичайна ситуація, оскільки він може створити інфекцію, яка може поширитися на інші частини тіла. Якщо ви вважаєте, що у вас абсцесований зуб, негайно зв'яжіться з нашим офісом, щоб запланувати невідкладну допомогу.<br/><br/>Залежно від випадку, терапія кореневих каналів може потребувати більше одного візиту. Початковий рентген буде взятий для оцінки зуба і кореневого каналу і визначити ступінь пошкодження і інфекції, якщо присутні. Вам буде надана форма анестезії, щоб змусити вас розслабитися.<br/><br/>Коли область оніміє, наш стоматолог створить камеру доступу до кореневого каналу за допомогою електричного наконечника.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Церковний дно деревини<br/><br/>Хайгейт<br/><br/>Церковний дно деревини, Хайгейт<br/><br/>Назва: Ліс королеви<br/><br/>Між 1860 і 1880 роками центр був вирваний з лондонського Сіті для будівництва каналізації, залізниць і нових доріг. Будинки були знесені без огляду на орендарів, які повинні були знайти будь-яке житло, яке вони могли в іншому місці. Менеджери вирушили в Ліво в Кенсінгтоні і Сент-Джонс-Вуд, в той час як найбідніші зібралися в лежбищах, таких як Сім циферблатів і Ліссон-Гроув. Для тих, хто між ними, клерки і кваліфіковані робітники, спекулятивні будівельники ставили ряд за рядом терасних вілл, і містер Путер переїхав в Холлоуей. Мешканці Масвелл-Хілл спостерігали, як будинки повзуть по полях Фінсбері-парку, вгору по Крауч-Хілл і вниз по іншій стороні, так що до 1880 року Крауч-Енд розроблявся, і, здавалося, не було ніякого способу зупинити потік. Десять років по тому великі маєтки Muswell Hill були продані. Upton Farm був проданий, і церковні комісари хотіли розробити Churchyard Bottom Wood, який тепер називається Queen's Wood. Історія зробила б п'єсу Ібсена. Дві групи чесних, високо мотивованих людей борються за те, що вони вважали правильним. Церковні комісари, з одного боку, і Комітет благодійних організацій Хорнсі, з іншого, вважали, що вони роблять все можливе для інших людей, і громадськість піднялася проти них обох в обуренні.<br/><br/>У той час Muswell Hill Road була сільською дорогою, з Southwood Hall на одному кінці і Upton Farm на іншому. До 1894 року Onslow Gardens був побудований, Connaught Gardens відзначився, і будівельники були готові розвивати маєток Woodlands. Вирізаний з Churchyard Bottom Wood був групою котеджів на трикутній ділянці. Недатована карта, яку тримають церковні комісари, показує шість котеджів пустки з отвором між ними - не дорога, не металева, а шлях до полуничних ліжок позаду. Далі був ще один проміжок, який вів до доріжок через ліс. Ці два отвори повинні були стати основою плану. Ті ж два проміжки і очищений грунт, який був полуничним полем, можна побачити на карті 1894 року нижче. Вони показані як 'Muswell Hill Cottages' і, досить мимохідь, Пітер Селлерс повинен був жити на тому ж місці набагато пізніше. Щоб розробити деревину як житловий масив, комісари повинні були проїхати дві дороги від Muswell Hill Road і побудувати будинки вздовж них. Сам по собі фасад Muswell Hill Road не забезпечив би місця для достатньої кількості будинків, щоб зробити підприємство гідним.<br/><br/>Земля і котеджі були надані набагато раніше як милостині для розміщення старих людей і від їх імені утримувалися довіреними особами благодійних комісарів Хорнсі. До 1890-х років котеджі були зруйновані, потребували капітального ремонту. Громадський дух, бажаючи зробити найкраще для своїх старих орендарів, довірені особи не могли поліпшити їх, оскільки у них не було грошей. За кілька років до того церковні комісари планували розробити Gravel Pit Wood (тепер Highgate Wood) як житловий масив, але це зустріло таку опозицію, що вони відступили. Замість цього, в 1886 році, вони віддали всі 69 акрів лісу для громадськості. У той же час вони запропонували продати Churchyard Bottom Wood міській районній раді Хорнсі за 25 000 фунтів стерлінгів, але це було занадто багато для Хорнсі, щоб зібрати самостійно. Рада сказала, що люди, які живуть за межами Хорнсі, також користуються деревом і інші органи влади повинні допомогти, але ніякої допомоги не було надано. Врешті-решт пропозиція була відкладена.<br/><br/>Карта, що показує котеджі Muswell Hill, які були центром суперечки.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road приблизно 1880<br/><br/>Схоже, що ці три пари котеджів були в центрі суперечки.<br/><br/>Церковні комісари хотіли зібрати гроші для своєї церковної роботи у Великій Британії та за кордоном. Вони вважали, що їм дали землю, яка буде використовуватися для пропаганди релігії, і якщо це означало продаж землі або лісу, це було меншим злом, ніж обмеження роботи церкви. Вони дали громадськості Gravel Pit Wood: на його місці вони розробляли Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Опікуни Хорнсейських благодійних фондів хотіли приносити дохід, щоб допомогти своїм бідним людям, тому вони зробили пропозицію Комісарам. Трикутний шматок землі був занадто незграбною формою, щоб бути економічно розвиненим, але якщо комісари нададуть їм ще трохи землі, щоб перетворити її на квадратну ділянку, вони побудують двадцять п'ять акуратних вілл. Вони приносили земельну ренту в розмірі 225 фунтів стерлінгів на рік, яка могла бути використана для полегшення бідності людей Хорнсі. Взамін вони дозволили б комісіонерам прорізати дві дороги через свою землю, щоб комісари могли розробляти ліси.<br/><br/>Коли ця пропозиція стала відома, люди відразу відреагували з тривогою.<br/><br/>16 грудня 1893 року пан Карвелл Вільямс запитав у Палаті громад, чи церковні комісари погодилися продати смугу землі опікунам благодійних організацій Хорнсі за умови, що існуюча дорога буде розширена до 40 футів, чи це було попередньою схемою будівництва, і якщо палата парламенту матиме можливість висловити свою думку.<br/><br/>Пан Левесон Говер, комісар церковних маєтків, відповів: «Так» на першу частину.<br/><br/>Містер Карвелл Вільямс, "Чи я розумію, що це намір знищити ту частину Хайгейт Вудс, будуючи на ньому?"<br/><br/>Через два дні The Star опублікувала статтю, гідну будь-якого сучасного таблоїда.<br/><br/>Зірка<br/>18 грудня 1893 р.<br/><br/>Парламент повинен пильно стежити за тими старими вандалами і конфедератами будівничого Церковних Комісарів. Вони завжди відчужують якийсь шматок землі або віддають перевагу будівельникам на відміну від широкої громадськості. Комісари не хотіли продавати деревину Churchyard Bottom платникам податків, але тепер пропонують «відкрити її», перерізавши дві широкі дороги через неї у зв'язку з однією з їх численних схем будівництва. Хіба хтось не поставить питання в парламенті і не перевірить цегляну і мінометну політику Комісарів?»<br/><br/>До того часу, як це було надруковано, питання було поставлено, і відповідь була або неправдою, або підступною. Інші газети взялися за цю історію. «Таймс» у своєму довгому звіті зазначала, що комнусіонери не були готові дати зобов'язання, щоб парламент або будь-який інший громадський орган мав можливість розглянути будь-яку схему будівництва на місці деревини.<br/><br/>Ситуація кипіла протягом вісімнадцяти місяців, поки церковні комісари не були змушені відкрити розслідування, яке почалося в Хайгейті 31 травня 1895 року під головуванням помічника церковного комісара. Запит викликав шквал газетних листів, з яких це було найважливішим.<br/><br/>Щоденна хроніка, 5 червня 1895 р.<br/><br/>ВАНДАЛІЗМ НА ВИСОКІЙ<br/><br/>Пане<br/><br/>Один з найпрекрасніших шматочків лісу в субуранському Лондоні знаходиться під загрозою. Чи допоможете ви нам відвернути те, що було б лихом, не тільки для найближчого району, але і для всього густонаселеного Північного Лондона? У жодній частині мегаполісу будівельник не був більш активним, ніж у Крауч-Енді та Хорнсі. Прекрасні луки рік-два тому тепер є будинками та магазинами. Балластні купи зайняли місце величавих в'язів і каштанів, і колись приємні села розділяють долю Страуд-Грін, Гаррінгей, Фінсбері-парк, Хайбері і Іслінгтон.<br/><br/>---- Об'єктом є будівництво двох сорокафутових доріг через ліс. Ми в цьому районі знаємо значення сорокафутових доріг через ліс. Це означає, що ліси приречені. Десять років тому агітація врятувала сестринське дерево шістдесят п'ять акрів - Gravel Pit Woods - і ніхто, хто бачив, як натовпи Bank Holiday стікалися по Арчвей-роуд з тужливих вулиць Холловея, Іслінгтона та Клеркенвелла, і спостерігав за гострим задоволенням дітей та сімейних вечірок пікнік на траві та серед дерев, не міг не зрозуміти величезну, що гранти від цього Північного дерева були цілком. ----<br/><br/>Церковні комісари володіють майже третиною великої парафії Хорнсі. Завдяки ліберальним витратам грошей платників податків на відкриття доріг і загальний розвиток округу вартість їх власності надзвичайно зросла, і від цього незаробленого приріст вони щороку отримують великі доходи. Певно, платники податків, чиї гроші таким чином допомогли створити величезну власність, можуть очікувати ліберального ставлення взамін.<br/><br/>Твоїм слухняним,<br/><br/>Підписаний вікарієм Сент-Джеймс', Muswell Hill, міністром Park Chapel, Crouch End, адвокатом, що живе в Onslow Gardens і трьома членами окружної ради.<br/><br/>Це був постріл прямо через луки Церковних Комісарів. Свої релігійні лідери і районна рада, всі в збройовій формі говорили, що церква була надто багатою і повинна бути благодійною, а не жадібною. Включення двох священиків було розумним кроком. Пам’ятайте, що це все ще було в розпал суперечки Дарвіна. Дарвін розділив віру в вчення Церкви, і багато людей обурювалися б силою Церкви тільки з цієї точки зору. Церква не була настільки безпечною, як вона прикидалася.<br/><br/>Газета «Вечірні вісті» від 7 червня 1895 року писала:<br/><br/>"Якщо церковні комнусіонери не будуть зайняті відразу, восьминіг отримає хватку деревини, яку буде дуже важко розслабити пізніше, --. Тому лондонцям доводиться вставати і робити, якщо вони збережуть одну з найсмачніших частин сільських пейзажів. "Публічне розслідування відкладається на четвер, а до цього потрібно щось зробити, щоб переконати комісарів, що громадяни Лондона не потерплять конфіскації одного з їхніх улюблених ігрових майданчиків", - йдеться в заяві.<br/><br/>Наступного дня в газеті «Daily Chronicle» було написано:<br/><br/>.................................................................................................................................................................................................. Це було з великим полегшенням, що жителі, близько десяти років тому, чули, що купівля верхнього дерева була здійснена; і як чудово це виявилося, кожен, хто відвідав їх, може свідчити, але всі, хто докладав зусиль, щоб врятувати ці верхні ліси, які лежать на західній стороні Muswell Hill дороги, відчували, що їх перемога була неповною, поки шістдесят акрів на східній стороні залишилися в небезпеці. Це, так би мовити, нещасний випадок, що ліси розділені широкою високою дорогою. Чи може хто-небудь сумніватися, який ефект був би, якби Churchyard Bottom Wood були замінені рядами невеликих вілл, кожна з яких посилає свій внесок диму та сажі? Чи може хтось сумніватися, яку серйозну різницю це зробить для мальовничого оточення куплених лісів, якщо лінія нових будинків буде збита прямо на їх листяному фасаді?<br/><br/>Це висловило думку багатьох людей. Насправді, Gravel Pit Wood, який автор називає «Верхнім деревом», не був куплений, а переданий округу Церковною комісією, про що вони повинні були повторювати знову і знову протягом багатьох років, але більшість людей ігнорували його. Комісія не збиралася віддавати друге дерево, що б хтось не говорив, і дотримувалася цієї позиції до кінця.<br/><br/>Г. С. Чемберлен з 5 Cranley Gardens у листі до Times від 8 червня 1895 року закликав придбати.<br/><br/>Я знаю, що це звичайне говорити різко про церковних комісарів, але як довірених осіб фонду, які вони зобов'язані управляти ним виключно на користь, і тому, якщо щось повинно бути зроблено, щоб врятувати знесення деревини, мені здається, що це може бути здійснено тільки шляхом придбання майна у комнусіонерів, які, як я знаю, повністю живі для захисту вільних і відкритих просторів.<br/><br/>(Це стосується ігрових полів Крауч Енд, які були забезпечені кількома роками пізніше.)<br/><br/>Як голова Консервативної асоціації Muswell Hill, я постійно на зв'язку з жителями, і я можу з упевненістю стверджувати, що кожна людина, яка проживає в цьому районі, зробить все необхідне для збереження.<br/><br/>(Все, що він особисто хотів, це благодійний дохід, щоб утримувати свій бідний народ. Він вимагав свій акр землі - не дуже багато напевно - він вірив запевнення комісарів, що дереву не загрожує небезпека.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road була однією з найкращих в Хорнсі і залишалася однаково красивою, з будинками або без будинків.<br/><br/>(А потім прийшов великий риторичний розквіт.)<br/><br/>"Чи страждають бідні через сентиментальні заперечення і істеричний крик "вовк щойно підняв ваші кореспонденти? Щось повинно бути зроблено, і що скоро. Акрів землі, доданий до благодійної нерухомості, не зробить помітної різниці для землі, що залишилася, в той час як прибуток, отриманий від нього, допоможе багатьом бідним старим і заслуженим особам у їх занепадних роках і дозволить нам передати нашим наступникам маєток, який у далекому майбутньому буде мати велику цінність у наданні благодійної допомоги заслуженим бідним парафії Хорнсі.<br/><br/>Читаючи його лист один відчуває істерію дуже близько до поверхні. Чому він думав, що комісари хотіли побудувати дорогу? Чому вони повинні витрачати всі ці гроші, якщо не будувати будинки? Здавалося, він ніколи не усвідомлював, що за один акр землі буде втрачено цілий ліс. Він був людиною, якій комісари зробили пропозицію про продаж за 25 000 фунтів стерлінгів до того, і це його ім'я, яке шанується на дошці на годинниковій вежі Крауч Енд за збереження дерева, але його довіра до церковних комісарів здається наївною. Дуже сумно, що під час розслідування він повинен був бути кинутий на роль диявола.<br/><br/>Розслідування продовжено<br/><br/>Відкладений відкрився в Хайгейт 15 червня 1895 року. Очікуючи великого збору, зал Ради був повністю змінений. Звичайні столи були видалені, а кімната заповнена стільцями. До половини сьомої кімната була переповнена людьми, які боролися за місця.<br/><br/>Пан Мюррей, комісар, сказав, що розслідування було дійсно простим. Парохіальні благодійні організації Хорнсі хотіли придбати ділянку землі, що примикає до їх благодійної власності на задньому плані. Питання полягало в тому, чи Комісія з благодійності, яка контролювала всі благодійні організації, мала достатню силу, щоб зупинити їх. Церковні комісари були готові продати землю на дуже вигідних умовах, і доходи Благодійника були б дуже значно збільшені.<br/><br/>Проти цього були три класи заперечень.<br/><br/>Початковий траст був призначений для надання котеджів для бідних, але довірчі особи пропонували побудувати вілли, які були б занадто дорогими для бідних. Проте, це було в силі довірених осіб, щоб змінити умови довіри, так що вони могли будувати вілли, якщо вони думали, що бідні в кінцевому підсумку принесуть користь. Самі бідні люди можуть заперечувати, але ліберальні умови вже були обіцяні для них. Третє заперечення стосувалося естетичної та громадської сторони питання. Він взяв з того, що читав, що Комісія з благодійності повинна втрутитися, щоб перешкодити церковним комісарам здійснювати свій власний розсуд у розпорядженні власним майном.<br/><br/>Розслідування обговорювало дрібниці, але оратори постійно поверталися до основної проблеми запобігання будь-якого руйнування деревини. Клерк Вестрі з Іслінгтона, який представляв 300 000 чоловік, зробив офіційний протест з приводу того, що будь-яка частина дерева, настільки цінна для жителів Іслінгтона і Хорнсі, використовується для приватних цілей. Вілфред Вайт сказав, що якщо комісари дадуть їм час, вони зможуть зібрати гроші, щоб компенсувати довіреним особам.<br/><br/>Пан Бомонт сказав, що вони не хотіли вілли, вони хотіли котеджів для бідних людей, які були вигнані з району. Інші казали, що не було грошей, щоб побудувати котеджі, щоб замінити нинішні занедбані, але вілли будуть економічною пропозицією. Інші заперечували, що є безліч вілл, щоб впустити Хайгейт. Дерево було священним. Зверніть увагу на питання про ліс.<br/><br/>Д-р Флетчер сказав, що серед працюючих людей був крик про те, що некуди йти. Робітники прийшли до нього з криком: "Ми вигнані з Хайгейт і зобов'язані йти в Хайгейт-Нове місто". Якщо фасад Muswell Hill Road був проданий, не було ніяких сумнівів, але що дороги можуть бути прорізані прямо через ліс у напрямку Хорнсі, але якщо комісари не могли отримати землю від Благодійної комісії, вони не могли перерізати дорогу.<br/><br/>Він був дуже впевнений, що котеджі можуть бути приведені в відповідний стан ремонту. Бідні люди, поліція і ряд робітничих класів попросили його представити ці два пункти, що котеджне житло було дуже потрібне в Хайгейті і що, якщо вони колись дозволять продати землю, невідомо, де буде залишатися рука будівельника.<br/><br/>(Довгий і довгоочікуваний).<br/><br/>Численні інші люди говорили, і комнусіонер підсумував, сказавши, що він вважає, що переважаюча думка була на користь збереження котеджів, але зустріч не повинна робити ніяких висновків з того, що він сказав.<br/><br/>Інші казали, що опікуни Благодійника не виконали своїх обов'язків, дозволивши котеджам прийти в занепад.<br/><br/>Г.Р. Вільямс, опікун, який раніше писав газеті, сказав, що він мав на найкращому рівні, що церковні комісари не будуть робити ніяких доріг, і вони не отримають жодної користі від дій благодійних комісарів. Інші були набагато менш довірливими, і зустріч закінчилася майже через три години.<br/><br/>"Ми стикаємося з тим, що в Хайгейт і Масвелл-Хілл є кілька людей, які хочуть, щоб Churchyard Bottom Wood і не будуть щасливі, поки вони не отримають його - в той час як ніхто, здається, не хоче витрачати гроші, щоб заплатити за це. Всі говорять, що було б чудово мати дерево як відкритий простір, але всі думають, що це обов'язок когось іншого, щоб зробити його одним. Islington Vestry «вирішила» на цю тему, але Islington Vestry не пропонує ні копійки на покупку. Немає більш складної проблеми для спільноти або індивіда, ніж те, як заволодіти чужою власністю, не заплативши за неї.<br/><br/>Плата за це була дійсно проблемою, оскільки Churchyard Bottom Wood став предметом інтенсивних місцевих та національних дебатів. Спільний комітет був сформований для збору грошей для збереження деревини. 20 листопада 1896 року C.F. Корі-Райт, почесний скарбник, написав у The Standard, щоденну газету того часу, закликаючи до допомоги. Він нагадав всім про небезпеку втрати деревини і сказав, що її можна врятувати, тільки купивши її. Церковні комісари продадуть за 25 000 фунтів стерлінгів і додатково (5 000 будуть потрібні для огорожі та дренажу, що в цілому становить 30 000 фунтів стерлінгів. Це було занадто багато для Ради Хорнсі, щоб зібрати, але вони вже проголосували за 10 000 фунтів стерлінгів до загальної суми. Ліси мали неоціненну цінність для всього Північного Лондона, тому він звернувся до державних органів та приватних осіб, щоб зібрати решту 20 000 фунтів стерлінгів. Він попередив, що ця пропозиція від церковних комісарів була відкрита лише до кінця 1898 року. Після цього будівельники переїжджають.<br/><br/>Звернення було тепло привітано пресою. Приватний законопроект був поспіхом пройшов через парламент, і Закон про збереження Хайгейт-Вудс 1897 року став законом. Тепер Conunittee мав право рекламувати внески на купівлю деревини та її збереження.<br/><br/>За досить короткий час майже всі гроші були зібрані, але останні кілька тисяч виявилися дуже складними для збору, і крайній термін Комісарів був питанням тижнів. Пан Корі-Райт писав прохання про більший час, але йому було надано лише три місяці, а потім лише за умови, що за додатковий період на повну суму були сплачені відсотки в розмірі 4%. Зрештою, Рада Лондонського графства, яка спочатку запропонувала 2500 фунтів стерлінгів, склала 5000 фунтів стерлінгів, і загальна сума була досягнута, але це була близька справа.<br/><br/>Рада вирішила перейменувати Дерево в «Королівські ліси» на честь Діамантового ювілею королеви Вікторії, і Хорнсі влаштував прекрасну демонстрацію крою, коли герцогиня Олбані офіційно оголосила Дерево відкритим «для вільного використання публікою назавжди».<br/><br/>У той час як кампанія з порятунку Churchyard Bottom Wood була запущена і керувалася місцевими жителями, які пристрасно відчували цей шматок лісу, вони закликали до допомоги і досвіду величезної мережі людей, деякі з яких працювали разом у подібних кампаніях більше тридцяти років. Комітет видав звернення, надруковане на папері дуже хорошої якості і носячи деякі відомі імена.<br/><br/>Питання відкритого простору та громадського здоров'я були основними темами вікторіанського бачення.<br/><br/>Рух відкритих просторів<br/><br/>Октавія Хілл, великий реформатор житла, яка почала з трьох старих будинків в Мерілебоуні, куплених для неї Джолмом Раскіном, швидко стала експертом з житла бідних людей в найздоровіших умовах. Вона купувала оренду, а потім збивала деякі з переповнених будинків, щоб принести світло і повітря до решти, вважаючи, що свіже повітря і сонячне світло були єдиним способом врятувати бідних людей від гнійної лихоманки. Вона дізналася про це в дитинстві від свого дідуся, Саутвуда Сміта, який розробив свої теорії в лікарні лихоманки на Кінгс-Кросс.<br/><br/>Він побудував перші промислові будинки для бідних людей і статистично довів, що хороше повітря та гідний дренаж врятували життя. Gibson Gardens, в Northwold Road, є прямим результатом ідей Southwood Smith. Більше інформації про Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Важливість open air<br/><br/>Відкриті простори і можливість дихати чистим повітрям, були необхідні для людей, що живуть в одній або двох переповнених кімнатах. Октавія Хілл взяла її заряди з трущоб Ліссон Гроув, вгору по проспекту Фіцджон до Хемпстед Хіт. Вона так любила поля на проспекті Фіцджон, що намагалася купити їх як громадський парк. Вони повинні були коштувати 10 000 фунтів стерлінгів, і протягом трьох серпневих тижнів було зібрано 8 500 фунтів стерлінгів. Потрібно було лише закінчити літні канікули і повернути з свята співчутливих друзів, а ще 1500 фунтів були б зібрані, але власники раптово відкликали свою пропозицію. Незважаючи на всі благання, поля були покриті великими будинками.<br/><br/>З цього розвинулася кампанія за порятунок Парламентського пагорба, наступного відкритого простору на північ від Ліссон-Гроув, скуповуючи поля на шляху будівельників, щоб зробити постійний кордон проти наступаючих цеглин. Кампанія Parliament Hill Fields була настільки успішною, що законопроект Hampstead Heath був прийнятий, і від апеляції залишилися гроші. З цих грошей і поштовху до відкритих просторів було розроблено Національний траст. Октавія Хілл була зацікавлена в охороні таких територій, як Черч Боттом Вуд протягом багатьох років, тому вона була природним союзником у боротьбі за порятунок Дерева.<br/><br/>Товариство охорони громади також було знайоме з цим видом агітації та збору грошей. Вони знесли огорожу, коли лорди садиби замкнули шматки спільної землі, ведучи як законні, так і незаконні битви проти зарозумілої приватизації землі, традиційно вільної. Роберт Хантер, їхній почесний адвокат з 1868 року, завжди був зацікавлений у забезпеченні відкритих просторів, великих чи малих, для громадськості. Він, тепер сер Роберт Хантер, став головою Church Bottom Appeal. Головою Товариства збереження громад був пан Шоу-Лефевр (пізніше лорд Еверслі), який зіграв велику роль у цій та інших кампаніях у Палаті громад. Октавія Хілл була залучена до їх роботи приблизно з 1875 року.<br/><br/>У той же час Октавія Хілл виступала за законопроект про поховання.<br/><br/>Міські кладовища стали настільки повними і такими серйозними загрозами для здоров'я, забруднюючи колодязі, з яких люди черпали питну воду, що міські поховання більше не дозволялися. Натомість на околицях міста створювалися кладовища. Кладбище Абні Парк було одним з них. Потім був рух, щоб видалити надгробки до країв старих міських кладовищ, перезахоронити тіла в іншому місці і перетворити кладовища в сади і відкриті простори, замість того, щоб будувати на них. Ця земля в центрі Лондона була дуже цінною, і спекулянти прагнули її отримати: навіть квакери побудували над одним зі своїх кладовищ і погрожували зробити це знову, побудувавши над Банхіл-Філдс. У Октавії Хілл була мережа союзників в десятку полів, тому її допомога в порятунку Чорч Боттом Вуд, мабуть, була неоціненною.<br/><br/>Товариство Метрополітен-Гарденс, засноване в 1882 році, розмістило близько двохсот невеликих садів в центрі міста до 1890 року. Пізніше вони передали їх місцевій владі, тому їх підтримка заклику до дерев'яного двору була гарантована з самого початку.<br/><br/>Суспільство Kyrle зараз забуте, але свого часу мало великий вплив на міське планування та законодавство відкритого простору. Товариство було створено близько 1875 року для «Поширення краси», щоб привнести колір і інтерес в життя людей, які живуть в нудному, сірому оточенні. Яскравий колір стін і прикрас, гарний спів, відкриті простори, природа, література і мистецтво. Все це входило до компетенції Товариства. Існувало Декоративне відділення, для якого Вільям Морріс читав лекції; Музичне відділення для просування хорів та щасливих вечорів для людей у місцевих шкільних будівлях; і Літературне відділення. Товариство регулярно зверталося з листами в «Таймс», до «багатших класів» за книгами та періодичними виданнями, які повинні розповсюджуватися в клубах хлопчиків і дівчаток, богадільнях та інших місцях. Однак Комітет відкритих просторів був найактивнішим. Сама назва «Кірл» походить від імені Папи «Людина Росса», філантропа, який дав своє місце народження людям як громадський парк. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light.

І я ще раз вдячний своєму чоловікові, Еду, за те, що він зробив весь кліпарт для мене.<br/><br/>Виготовлення візерунка подяки<br/><br/>Як говорить назва, ця гра про створення шаблонів. Маленькі, які просто дізнаються про шаблони, можуть просто відповідати зображенням на смугах шаблону, в той час як інші можуть продовжувати шаблон з картками зображень на порожніх смугах.<br/><br/>Щоб зробити папку файлу, ви хочете вирізати сітку зображень, щоб зробити шматки карти. Я рекомендую ламінувати їх, щоб допомогти їм прослужити довше. Потім приклейте шаблон стрічки на папку файлу.<br/><br/>Я також хотів мати порожні смуги візерунка, щоб дівчата могли бачити, де продовжувати візерунок і скільки розкласти. Я прикріпив їх збоку папки, використовуючи стрічку, щоб вони могли скластися, щоб упакувати гру і розширити макет шаблону.<br/><br/>Я також додав додаткову порожню, щоб дівчата могли зробити свій власний візерунок.<br/><br/>Туреччина Номер гри<br/><br/>У цій грі дівчата додають пір'я до тіла індички, практикуючи підрахунок і розпізнавання чисел. Я використовував безбарвне пір'я, щоб діяти як керівництво для того, де додати пір'я і так, щоб дівчата могли відповідати числам. І будьте впевнені, що при склеюванні тіла індички ви тільки приклеюєте в центрі, щоб шматки крила могли ковзати під тілом.<br/><br/>Після того, як всі пір'я розкладені, ми практикуємо просту арифметику, наприклад, забираємо три пір'я і бачимо, скільки їх залишилося, а потім додаємо два назад, щоб побачити, що воно дорівнює.<br/><br/>На додаток до чорно-білих крил, ми також включили безбарвну індичку, якщо ви хочете, щоб малюки забарвили свій власний набір. Замість гри в папку з файлом ви можете перетворити це в ремесло, розфарбовувати шматки, вирізати їх і склеювати їх разом.<br/><br/>Інший варіант полягає в тому, щоб використовувати шматки, щоб зробити повстяну історію дошки. Ми іноді співаємо версію індички 10 Маленькі індіанці:<br/><br/>Ось так:<br/><br/>Хто я?<br/><br/>Я думаю, що саме тут я повинен сказати щось дотепне про себе. Ну добре. Я мама-домогосподарка для трьох чудових дітей - наших дочок-близнюків, яким зараз сім років, і дворічного сина, який повний енергії. У моєму житті до дітей я був вчителем, і я тепер вдома навчання наших дітей. Я також одружений на Ед, який в даний час служить у ВПС, і є любов мого життя (було б незручно, якби він не був). Наша сім'я велика на книгах, ремесел, і весело провести час разом. Я просто думав, що я б розділити нашу діяльність в моєму власному маленькому куточку в Інтернеті.<br/><br/>Зої, здається, все це - багатий, красивий чоловік, легке життя в Нью-Йорку - але вона зробила помилки в минулому, і ці помилки повертаються в її новому житті. Я виявився на краю мого місця для більшої частини книги і був здивований ...<br/><br/>Я любив цю книгу, я люблю історію, і я вдячний Марго Шеттерлі висвітлила її. Моя єдина скарга полягала в тому, що я хотів би, щоб вона обговорювала роль Кетрін Джонсон у пізніших місіях трохи більше, але я думаю, що історія повинна була закінчити сом ...<br/><br/>Я хотів, щоб сподобалася ця книга, і я зробив протягом більшої частини цього.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Вживання алкоголю людьми у віці до 21 року було визначено як основну проблему громадського здоров'я. Дослідження відзначають, що це збільшує ризик інвалідності і може бути шкідливим для розвитку мозку. Неповнолітні, які п'ють, частіше вчиняють самогубство, порушують закон або стають жертвами насильства. Алкоголь причетний до майже однієї третини смертельних випадків на дорогах серед молоді. Загальна річна вартість неповнолітнього вживання алкоголю оцінюється в 62 мільярди доларів. Хоча більшість законів, спрямованих на запобігання вживання алкоголю неповнолітніми, приймаються на рівні штатів, на федеральному рівні існує законодавча активність та зацікавленість у підтримці зусиль штатів щодо приборкання цієї проблеми. У цьому звіті описуються масштаби вживання алкоголю неповнолітніми, нещодавня законодавча діяльність з цього питання та різні політичні наслідки. Він буде оновлюватися по мірі появи нових даних. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

Це не було політичне лобіювання або громадські петиції, які призвели до реформи продовольства, а скоріше зусилля на низовому рівні, очолювані громадянами, які мають право фактично впроваджувати та виконувати зміни.<br/><br/>Я закінчив пост, натякаючи на одне питання: чому нам так важко робити це самим? Якщо вся країна може реалізувати і поширити спільний погляд на їжу, чому ми не можемо?<br/><br/>Ніщо насправді не заважає нам імітувати успіх Данії. Проблема в тому, що ми завалені такою кількістю повідомлень про те, що ми повинні їсти, і як ми повинні жити, важко зрозуміти, з чого почати. Тому замість того, щоб слідувати успішним рамкам, які, як було показано, працюють (наприклад, Маніфест про скандинавську їжу), більшість людей стрибають від захоплення дієтою до захоплення дієтою, намагаючись знайти «правильний спосіб поїсти».<br/><br/>Але як Клаус Маєр досяг успіху? Який був секретний соус, який допоміг Маніфесту захопити? І чи є розумним думати, що ми можемо застосувати ці уроки до нашого власного життя?
