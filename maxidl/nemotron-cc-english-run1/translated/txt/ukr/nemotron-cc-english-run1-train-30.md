Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Поштова навігація<br/><br/>«Життя без паперів» отримав нагороду за найкращий сценарій<br/><br/>Блог-проект «Життя без паперів», створений Леном Грантом, розповідає про недокументовані сім’ї мігрантів та молодих людей. Недокументовані мігранти не мають нічого. Вони не мають права працювати. Вони не мають права ні на державні пільги, ні на місце проживання. Вони є невидимою і потенційно найуразливішою групою у Великій Британії сьогодні.<br/><br/>Недокументовані (або нелегальні) мігранти включають тих, хто був проданий в секс-торгівлю або для домашнього підневільного; вони включають осіб, які перестаралися з отриманням візи; тих, чиї заяви про надання притулку були відхилені, та інших, які зазнали невдач в імміграційній системі. Всі вони спочатку могли прибути до Великобританії легально.<br/><br/>"Нелегальні іммігранти" - ті, які, як вважають, в'їхали в країну в кузовах вантажівок - складають невелику частку тих, хто не має документів.<br/><br/>Дійсно, деякі джерела припускають, що половина з приблизно 120 000 недокументованих дітей у Великобританії насправді народилися тут від недокументованих батьків. Ці діти знаходяться в невигідному становищі від народження, виключно через їх імміграційний статус.<br/><br/>Блог розповідає історії недокументованих. Він підкреслює їх щоденну боротьбу та вразливість, а також їх силу та стійкість. Це нелегке читання.<br/><br/>Ви можете отримати доступ до блогу через наш веб-сайт (внизу правої колонки на головній сторінці).<br/><br/>Блог виграв онлайн-категорію медіа-нагороди Speaking Together. Нагороди стали новим доповненням цього року до нагороди «Жінка-мігрант та біженка року» у Королівському фестивальному залі в Лондоні в рамках Міжнародного жіночого дня. Суддівська група, включаючи романістку і драматурга Джилліан Слово, а також журналістку і авторку Ханну Пул, особливо шукала роботу, яка кидала виклик міфам і стереотипам.<br/><br/>Блог також виграв Blog North Awards 2013 в категорії «Найкращий письменник», а також був включений до шорт-листа премії Amnesty International Media Award. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Урок суботньої школи<br/><br/>У Посланні до Галатів Павло розглядає такі питання, як свобода, роль закону у спасінні, наш стан у Христі та природа життя під керівництвом Духа, а також вікове питання: Як можна зробити грішних людей праведними перед святим і справедливим Богом?<br/><br/>Багато вчених вважають, що Послання до Галатів може бути найдавнішим з послань Павла. Він був написаний в 49 році н.е., незабаром після знаменитого Єрусалимського собору (Дії 15). Тому книга може бути найдавнішим християнським документом, відомим. Як ясно показують Дії та Галатів, рання церква опинилася в запеклій боротьбі за природу спасіння, особливо у випадку язичників. На думку групи єврейських віруючих, відомих як юдаїзери, віра в Ісуса сама по собі не була достатньою для язичників. Язичники також повинні бути обрізані і дотримуватися законів Мойсея (Дії 15:1).<br/><br/>Довідник з вивчення Біблії цього кварталу запрошує нас подорожувати з апостолом Павлом, коли він благає галатів залишатися вірними Ісусу. Це також дає нам можливість поміркувати над власним розумінням істин, які відкрили шлях до остаточного розриву Мартіна Лютера з Римом і відновлення біблійного Євангелія. |

Його батько, майбутній ландграф, покинув сім'ю в 1747 році, в 1755 році формально розірвав шлюб з Марією. Дід, Вільгельм VIII, ландграф Гессенський, надав графство Ханау і його доходи Марії, молодий принц Чарльз і його два брати, Вільгельм і Фредерік, були виховані їх матір'ю і виховані протестантськими родичами з 1747 року. У 1756 році Марія переїхала до Данії, щоб піклуватися про неповнолітніх дітей своєї сестри, королеви Данії Луїзи. З нею вона взяла своїх синів, які виховувалися при дворі в палаці Крістіансборг в Копенгагені. Гессенські князі пізніше залишилися в Данії, ставши її важливими лордами, тільки старший брат Вільгельм повернувся в Гессен, в 1785 році, після підйому на ландграфство. Карл почав кар'єру в Данії.

У 1763 році його старший брат Вільям одружився з їх двоюрідним братом, Карл наслідував його приклад 30 серпня 1766 року в палаці Крістіансборг — його дружиною була Луїза Данська, і Чарльз, таким чином, став зятем свого двоюрідного брата, короля Крістіана VII. Шлюб відбувся, незважаючи на поради проти нього, через звинувачення принца Чарльза в розпусті. Незабаром після цього Чарльз потрапив у немилість при дворі, і на початку 1767 року у них з ним народиться перша дитина, Марія Софі, а потім друга дитина, Вільям, в 1769 році. У 1768 році Карл купив маєток і село Оффенбах-Румпенхайм у сім'ї Едельсгайм.

(Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Слідкуйте за нами<br/><br/>ЯВЛЯЄМОСЯ ВАМИ<br/><br/>ІНСАЙДЕР<br/><br/>Тяга до цукру? Ось що ваше тіло намагається сказати вам<br/><br/>по<br/>Берді<br/><br/>ФОТО:<br/><br/>Жакмус<br/><br/>Збільшення ваги від неконтрольованої тяги в сторону, це може розчаровувати постійне прагнення до чогось нездорового і не знаючи, чому. Хороша новина полягає в тому, що зазвичай є причина, яка лежить в основі цього палючого бажання розмістити пакет картопляних чіпсів, або відчуття, що ви можете насправді померти, якщо ви не отримаєте розсолу прямо зараз (навіть якщо ви не вагітні). Наприклад, якщо у вас є видіння батончиків Чумацького Шляху, це може означати, що вам не вистачає дуже специфічної поживної речовини у вашому раціоні.<br/><br/>Ми поговорили з дієтологом з Лос-Анджелеса Широю Ленчевським, MS, R.D., щоб отримати худий на деяких загальних харчових пристрастей, а також те, що ви можете зробити, щоб наситити голод, не виходячи за борт. Продовжуйте прокручувати для деякої серйозно хорошої інформації!<br/><br/>Якщо ви хочете шоколад<br/><br/>Це означає: вам може бути не вистачає магнію у вашому раціоні, говорить Ленчевський. "Магній є важливим мінералом, що бере участь у виробництві енергії, метаболізм глюкози і м'язової функції. Це особливо актуально для тих, хто важко б'є в тренажерний зал", - пояснює вона. Крім того, рівень магнію знижується протягом передменструальних тижнів вашого періоду, що пояснює, чому ПМС так часто супроводжується тягою до шоколаду.<br/><br/>«Я рекомендую дотримуватися 75 відсотків какао або вище і поєднувати його з іншим багатим магнієм джерелом, таким як насіння соняшнику», - говорить Ленчевський. Вона пропонує шоколадну марку Hu, невелику харчову компанію, яка фокусується на високоякісних інгредієнтах, вироблених на місцевому рівні. "Це трохи дорого, але тим більше причин тримати порції під контролем", - каже вона. "Це мій особистий фаворит". Ми також великі шанувальники супер-продуктів Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Якщо ви хочете цукерки<br/><br/>Це означає: «Випивання чистого цукру є гарним показником того, що у вас не вистачає енергії», - говорить Ленчевський. «Подумайте про це. Що ви відчуваєте після жахливого нічного сну або близько 4 вечора під час напруженого робочого дня? Відповідь, як правило, цукор, тому що він використовується в якості миттєвого палива для клітин нашого організму.<br/><br/>Замість цього, дістатися до яблук з горіховим маслом. "Якщо ви рейдерство ваших співробітників цукерки тайник, Я рекомендую більш повільне спалювання вуглеводів з джерелом жиру або білка", говорить Ленчевський. «На відміну від простого цукру, це буде підживлювати ваші клітини, уникаючи краху після цукру. Два варіанти, які зроблять для великих пікапів в наступний раз, коли ви хочете цукерки: нарізане яблуко з вашим вибором горіхового масла або ягоди з 2% несолодкого грецького йогурту. Нам подобається заглушати солодкий зуб цими звикаючими кокосовими чіпсами - вони заповнюються, без будь-якого доданого цукру, і просто так добре.<br/><br/>Якщо ви шукаєте сіль<br/><br/>Це означає: «Якщо нічого, крім самого солоного огірка, ви, можливо, не п'єте достатньо H2O», - говорить Ленчевський. «Сіль допомагає організму триматися за воду, тому ми прагнемо її, коли нам потрібні рідини».<br/><br/>Замість цього, дістатися до води. "Залишатися гідратовані, особливо, коли ми наближаємося до літніх місяців", говорить вона. Наступного разу, коли тяга вражає, спробуйте загасити його (буквально) з кількома освіжаючими склянками, і ви можете виявити, що терміновість для переїдання натрію зникає. "Якщо звичайна вода нудить вам, спробуйте додати м'яту, лимон або заморожені фрукти, щоб змішати його," говорить Ленчевський. І якщо це все ще не робить трюк, є більш здорова альтернатива пакетовані чіпси або картопля фрі. «Якщо ви дійсно просто прагнете солі, то підсмажені водорості - відмінний низькокалорійний варіант», - говорить вона.<br/><br/>Якщо ви прагнете крохмалистих вуглеводів, як макаронів<br/><br/>Це означає: «Оскільки продукти з високим вмістом вуглеводів підвищують рівень гормону серотоніну, тяга до крохмалю може бути ознакою того, що ви потребуєте підсилювача настрою», - говорить Ленчевський.<br/><br/>Замість цього, дістатися до ванни! "Вибий солі Епсома, тому що це час для деяких серйозних R + R," говорить Ленчевський. "Повірте мені. Поблажливість в крохмалю безкоштовно для всіх відчуває себе дуже добре в даний момент, але це, швидше за все, вас більше на наступний день. " (Як знає кожен, хто коли-небудь переборщував з піцою або пастою.) Тому наступного разу ви хочете зануритися головою в миску вуглеводів, натягнути ванну, запалити свічку і побалувати себе без будь-якого жалю або щільних калорій.<br/><br/>Якщо ви хочете морозиво<br/><br/>5 / 6 (англ.)<br/><br/>Це означає: «Ваше тіло може говорити вам, що йому потрібен здоровий жир».<br/><br/>"Я реаліст, тому, якщо ви хочете морозива, я не збираюся рекомендувати жменьку волоських горіхів, які, звичайно, повні здорового жиру", - говорить Ленчевський. "Для надзвичайних ситуацій з морозивом я рекомендую кокосове морозиво з низьким вмістом цукру, таке як Coconut Bliss або морозиво Кіппі з трьома складовими в Лос-Анджелесі". Ми можемо ручатися за той факт, що кокосове морозиво має неймовірний смак і так само, як справжня річ.<br/><br/>Якщо ви шукаєте бургер<br/><br/>Це означає: вам потрібно залізо. "Якщо ви не можете перестати думати про червоне м'ясо, є шанс, що ваше тіло прагне заліза, b12 і фолієвої кислоти," говорить Ленчевський. "Це особливо вірно під час або приблизно в цей час місяця."<br/><br/>"Я прихильник трав'яного харчування, антибіотиків і безгормонального червоного м'яса раз на тиждень," говорить Ленчевський. "Спробуйте експериментувати з відкритим обличчям бізон бургер - який, вирізаний для розрізу, є більш худим і має більше заліза, ніж яловичина." Не їжте м'ясо? Спробуйте включити якийсь рослинної основі заліза до вашої рутини, як спіруліна. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Веб-сервіси, постачальники та кіберзакони!<br/><br/>Оновлено:Квітень 21, 2014Білал Ахмад<br/><br/>Комп'ютеризація цього світу значною мірою змінила сценарій продуктивності людини, і це теж за межами вимірювання. Наприклад, тепер ви можете надсилати важливу інформацію по всьому світу одним клацанням миші, завдяки підключенню до Інтернету. На жаль, саме ця широка зв'язок і популярність серед людей, Інтернет також збільшив шанси на комп'ютерні злочини. Інтернет-злочини або комп'ютерні злочини широко відомі як "Кіберзлочини".<br/><br/>«Кіберзакони» - це щось нове в судовій системі, але останнім часом привернуло багато уваги. Термін кіберзлочинність - це щось дуже синонімічне зі звичайним злочином, єдина відмінність - середнє виконання. Існує два основних типи кіберзлочинів, перший з яких полягає в тому, що комп'ютери є основними цілями, і вони включають випадки пошкодження даних, шкідливий код і навіть доступ до злочинних даних. Другий - це комп'ютер, який є лише інструментом, за допомогою якого скоюються звичайні злочини, наприклад, кібертероризм, спам, кібер-сталкінг і багато іншого.<br/><br/>Це де веб-сайт консультант або постачальник приходить на сцену. Хоча не знаю про всі кібер закони, присутні на сьогоднішній день, постачальник веб-сайту може порадити вам про деякі з найбільш важливих кібер законів при створенні вашого сайту.<br/><br/>Це може включати загальні знання про права на копіювання або навіть захист вмісту вашого власного веб-сайту. Пояснення вам всіх прав, якими ви володієте як власник веб-сайту, також є однією з завдань, які постачальник веб-сайту може виконувати при розробці вашого веб-сайту. Постачальник також може допомогти вам, пропонуючи вам інформацію про різні кібер-закони для захисту даних. Крім того, постачальник може також запропонувати вам інформацію про будь-який новий кібер-закон, про який ви можете не знати, поки не дізнаєтеся. Кіберзакони можуть відрізнятися від країни до країни, одним з недавніх прикладів може бути закон про файли cookie, випущений у Великобританії, який заважає веб-сайту зберігати будь-які дані про перегляд користувачів. Відповідно до Закону про файли cookie, веб-сайти у Великобританії не можуть зберігати файли cookie без інформаційної згоди користувача.<br/><br/>Саме після імплементації такого закону веб-сайти тепер мають спливаюче вікно, яке вимагає згоди відвідувача на збереження файлів cookie. Такі файли використовуються веб-сайтами для аналізу шаблону перегляду відвідувачів, на основі якого рекламні оголошення потім розміщуються у вікні користувача. Оскільки хакерство більше не є новою річчю для всіх нас, чи вважаєте ви, що такі правила та норми можуть запобігти онлайн-підробці або кіберзлочинності? Технології розвиваються швидкими темпами, але люди все ще не віддають перевагу покупкам в Інтернеті через побоювання, що особисті або банківські реквізити будуть зламані. З ростом кіберзлочинності потреба в суворих кіберзаконах також зросла, щоб приборкати те ж саме і сприяти безризиковому досвіду покупок.<br/><br/>Класи кіберзлочинів<br/><br/>Протягом багатьох років існує три основних класи кіберзлочинів:<br/><br/>Несанкціонований доступ до кейсів комп'ютерної системи, який включає злом або крадіжку імен користувачів та паролів для отримання доступу до особистої інформації відповідного користувача. Такий тип доступу до бэкдорів організований за допомогою Троянського коня. Випуск шкідливих програм, таких як Trojan House, черв'яки або комп'ютерні віруси і т.д. Останній клас включає в себе кібер переслідування користувача або онлайн переслідування.<br/><br/>Прямі наслідки кіберзлочинів<br/><br/>Зниження продажів<br/><br/>Зменшення продуктивності персоналу через затримки мережі<br/><br/>Втрата персоналізованої інформації, такої як дослідницька робота<br/><br/>Порушення комунікаційного процесу<br/><br/>Непрямі наслідки кіберзлочинів<br/><br/>Проблема довіри до нашої фінансової системи<br/><br/>Імідж бренду затьмарений на ринку<br/><br/>Кіберзлочини впливають на ділові відносини на ринку<br/><br/>Почуття довіри до державної політики та державних органів втрачається<br/><br/>Запобігання кіберзлочинності<br/><br/>Як користувачі мережі існують певні запобіжні заходи, які ми повинні розглянути для безпечного та безпечного онлайн-досвіду. Ось деякі з них:<br/><br/>Перше, що потрібно зробити, це зберегти особисту інформацію для себе і не ділитися тим же в Інтернеті.<br/><br/>Уникайте обміну фотографіями з друзями або незнайомими людьми в онлайн-чаті.<br/><br/>Встановлення останньої версії антивірусу у вашій системі може запропонувати вам хорошу лінію захисту від інтернет-загроз, таких як віруси та шкідливі програми.<br/><br/>Підтримка резервного копіювання ваших цінних даних є хорошим варіантом, щоб уникнути таких проблем, як зараження вірусом.<br/><br/>Уникайте відправки інформації про кредитну картку на сайти, які не захищені і не мають чинного сертифіката.<br/><br/>Встановлення програми безпеки, яка пропонує вам контроль над файлами cookie сайту і захищає вас від відстеження веб-сайтами.<br/><br/>Розміщення пристроїв виявлення вторгнень на серверах допоможе вам відстежувати порушення в трафіку вашого веб-сайту.<br/><br/>Рекомендується використання брандмауера.<br/><br/>Чому кібератаки настільки популярні?<br/><br/>Дешевше, ніж традиційні методи обману<br/><br/>Відстежувати кіберзлочини непросто<br/><br/>Точні місця не можуть бути легко відстежені<br/><br/>Відсутність фізичного бар'єру в інтернеті<br/><br/>Кіберзлочини зачіпають велику кількість людей<br/><br/>Висновок<br/><br/>Той факт, що людський розум має незбагненну силу, незаперечний, тому інтернет-злочини зростають з величезною швидкістю. Навіть історія стала свідком того, що деякі з найбільших інтернет-безпеки пішли від рук хакерів, які також легко втекли. Єдиний спосіб приборкати такі злочини - залишатися в курсі кіберзаконів, які ми маємо сьогодні, які можуть бути або через Інтернет, або через постачальників веб-сайтів / ІТ. Закон про інформаційні технології повинен бути збалансований таким чином, щоб він виявився занадто суворим для людей, які причетні до кіберзлочинів, і в той же час він ніколи не повинен перешкоджати зростанню інтернет-індустрії.<br/><br/>Автор Біо: - Maneet Puri в даний час очолює якісну фірму веб-дизайну, розташовану в Нью-Делі, Індія.
