| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Сорок дев'ять років тому президент Ліндон Джонсон підписав Закон про виборчі права 1965 року.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Майже століття тому, 15-а поправка до Конституції США заявила: «Право громадян Сполучених Штатів голосувати не може бути відмовлено або обмежено Сполученими Штатами або будь-яким штатом через расу, колір шкіри або попередні умови рабства». І майже за століття до цього отці-засновники нашої нації привели в рух великий експеримент американської демократії, заявивши, що «всі люди створені рівними».<br/><br/>Закон про виборчі права 1965 року був запізнілим визнанням того, що навіть в Америці наші основоположні ідеали мають невелику вагу, якщо не захищені верховенством права. Ось чому розділ 2 15-ї поправки надав Конгресу «повноваження забезпечити виконання цієї статті відповідним законодавством».<br/><br/>І дійсно, кодифікована мова Закону про виборчі права змогла досягти того, чого не змогли Конгрес епохи Реконструкції та Томас Джефферсон. Закон про громадянські права 1964 року і Закон про виборчі права, а також рух за громадянські права, з якого вони виникли, послужили каталізатором для різкого збільшення можливостей для чорношкірих американців брати участь у демократичному процесі.<br/><br/>Наприклад, лише 6,7 відсотка чорношкірих міссісіпців були зареєстровані для голосування станом на 1962 рік; до 1969 року ця цифра досягла 66,5 відсотка. Сьогодні в Міссісіпі більше чорношкірих виборних чиновників, ніж у будь-якому іншому штаті.<br/><br/>Захист, введений Законом про виборчі права, був давно назрілий, коли вони були прийняті, що відображає важку боротьбу, з якою вони були досягнуті. Але немислимо, що цей захист зараз піддається нападу, ставлячи під загрозу прогрес, якого наша нація так важко досягла.<br/><br/>Минулого року у справі «Шелбі Каунті проти Холдера» Верховний суд США усунув ключовий компонент Закону про виборчі права, який дозволив попереднього федерального перегляду забезпечити недискримінацію до набуття чинності будь-якого нового закону про голосування.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>На жаль, республіканські лідери нічого не зробили. Сенатор Тед Круз і губернатор Рік Перрі вийшли зі свого шляху, щоб похвалити рішення Верховного суду. Сенатор Ренд Пол відкинув необхідність закону про виборчі права, зазначивши: «У нас є афроамериканський президент».<br/><br/>Хоча обрання президента Барака Обами дійсно було історичною віхою, небезпечно думати, що це звільняє нас від пильності щодо довготривалих наслідків минулого нашої нації. Поспіх, з яким штати перейшли до введення обмежень на голосування, є підтвердженням того, що захист, введений розділом 4, все ще необхідний.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Республіканські губернатори підписали суворі обмеження щодо фотоідентифікації як рішення практично неіснуючої проблеми самоідентифікації виборців, яка непропорційно шкодить жінкам, молоді, робочим сім'ям та афро-американській спільноті. Для республіканців, таких як Пол, нечесно шукати голоси цих громад, коли вони вважають, що «немає нічого поганого в тому, щоб» встановлювати обмеження, які ускладнюють голосування в цих виборчих округах.<br/><br/>Республіканці також прагнули обмежити періоди раннього голосування, включаючи неділю перед днем виборів, коли афро-американські церкви мали великий успіх з програмами Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Ці обмеження представляють собою бездушні зусилля республіканців ускладнити голосування, засновані на вузьких, короткострокових політичних розрахунках, що республіканці можуть виграти вибори, скорочуючи розмір електорату.<br/><br/>Демократи мають зовсім іншу місію, коли справа доходить до голосування: забезпечити, щоб кожен виборець міг зареєструватися, щоб кожен зареєстрований виборець міг проголосувати і щоб кожен голос був точно підрахований.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Проект демократичного національного комітету з розширення виборців відображає нашу віру в те, що більша участь виборців зміцнює нашу націю і нашу демократію. Ми будемо продовжувати використовувати наші неперевершені інституційні знання для захисту виборчих прав від законодавства та тактики, які будуть намагатися придушити голосування. І оскільки найкращий захист - це хороший напад, ми також працюємо над розширенням голосування, застосовуючи наші технології та ресурси даних для реєстрації нових виборців.<br/><br/>У цей ювілей один з найкращих способів вшанувати тих, хто боровся, а в деяких випадках і віддав своє життя, бо прийняття закону полягає в тому, щоб республіканці в Конгресі приєдналися до демократів у прийнятті Закону про поправки до виборчих прав, щоб відновити обіцянку Закону про виборчі права 1965 року.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Деббі Вассерман Шульц, демократ, представляє 23-й округ Конгресу Флориди в Конгресі США. З 2011 року вона є головою Національного комітету Демократичної партії.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Питання і відповіді: експерт з охорони Ватикану о. Ганс Цолльнер SJ<br/><br/>13 червня 2021 р.<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Зображення: Австралійські єзуїти.<br/><br/>Президент Центру захисту дітей в Григоріанському університеті в Римі і член Папської комісії з захисту неповнолітніх, о. Ганс Цолльнер SJ, був в Австралії в 2018 році, щоб поговорити з лідерами католицького служіння і вижили.<br/><br/>Майкл Маквей з Jesuit Communications сів з ним під час візиту, щоб вивчити, як Церква реагує на кризу зловживань на міжнародному рівні, і що можна дізнатися з нашого досвіду в Австралії.<br/><br/>ММ: Це ваша третя поїздка до Австралії. Ви відвідали чимало інших країн, щоб побачити, як Церква реагує на зловживання по всьому світу. Чи можете ви дати нам уявлення про те, як виглядає глобальна картина?<br/><br/>о Ганс Зольнер SJ<br/><br/>ХЗ: На моє розуміння, після того, як я відвідав близько 50 країн на п’яти або шести континентах, Церква дійсно починає рухатися протягом останніх кількох років у питанні справедливості до жертв, вислуховування їх і робити все, що можна зробити з точки зору захисту.<br/><br/>Я був з єзуїтськими провінціялами з усієї Африки в кінці квітня, і президент єзуїтської допомоги Африки і Мадагаскару дуже відданий цьому. Він розробив ретельний план дій для формування та впровадження керівних принципів у всьому світі. Це дуже уважна і дуже навмисна спроба зробити все можливе, щоб активно брати участь як єзуїти в Африці - на континенті, де ще кілька років тому все це було іноземною мовою.<br/><br/>Одна з проблем у спробі розвинути цей глобальний підхід полягає в тому, що ви маєте справу з такою великою кількістю культур, і так багато різних порозумінь. Як ви об’єднуєте це і намагаєтеся забезпечити підготовку та підтримку релігійних громад, які займаються цими питаннями?<br/><br/>Це одне з найважливіших питань, які ми маємо. Я думаю, що я можу стимулювати дискусію, стимулювати роздуми, і підготувати людей, наскільки це можливо, щоб вони могли зробити основну роботу.<br/><br/>Центр захисту дітей при Григоріанському університеті не претендує на відповідь на кожне питання. Не тільки тому, що ми не знаємо конкретних контекстів - ми, можливо, знаємо деякі з них, але ми говоримо про тисячі культур, ми говоримо про сотні мов, ми говоримо про дуже різноманітні юридичні основи. Він варіюється навіть іноді в межах однієї країни, наприклад, в Австралії, де є штати в рамках Австралійського співдружності, які мають різні закони, ніж інші штати.<br/><br/>Я людина, яка намагається викликати і стимулювати дискусію і роздуми. Я також дуже рада слухати людей.<br/><br/>Ви згадали про необхідність вислухати та підтримати жертв, щоб їх почули. Очевидно, у нас була Королівська комісія тут, в Австралії, але які інші способи ви бачили, що голоси жертв підтримуються по всьому світу?<br/><br/>У Франції є одна єпархія, яка встановила те, що вони називають "Простір слухання". Там жертви можуть вийти вперед, і вони можуть висловити себе. Єпископ присутній. Це відкритий простір, в якому люди, які постраждали надзвичайно вільно, принаймні, висловити те, що вони хочуть попросити від керівництва Церкви і т.д.<br/><br/>Є й інші місця в США або в інших країнах, куди жертви були запрошені єпархіями, провінціями, керівництвом Церкви. Я повинен сказати, що в цілому я думаю, що є добра воля, і є більше людей, як єпископи і провінціали, які слухають жертв, ніж ми знаємо. Але не існує єдиної моделі надання жертвам не тільки простору для самовираження і вислуховування, а й для активної участі в церковному розвитку.<br/><br/>Що стосується створення простору для підтримки жертв, які речі, які ви бачили, дійсно могли б допомогти - і що ми могли б розглянути тут, в Австралії?<br/><br/>Один з основних моментів, який багато жертв піднімають: "Чи не можемо ми, в парафіяльних умовах, в школах, регулярна розмова відбувається, що включає в себе тих, хто пережив зловживання, як регулярні члени комітету, комісії, дошки звукозапису, групи зворотного зв'язку або щось подібне?" Таким чином, цей голос не тільки притягується за певної нагоди, або там, де людина відчуває, що він або вона знаходиться в точці, щоб бути в змозі говорити про це, але [чути] на регулярній основі - вбудуйте цей голос в систему.<br/><br/>Це допоможе всім нам. Це допоможе тим, хто вижив, і жертвам, тому що вони будуть відчувати себе бажаними і оціненими в конкретному досвіді і в конкретних життєвих викликах, які вони пережили. По-друге, це допоможе громаді в цілому, тому що ми можемо, принаймні, зробити себе все більш і більш чутливими до проблем і конкретних потреб тих, хто вижив, які також можуть говорити про потреби молодих людей.<br/><br/>М: У нас є сильні групи людей, які вижили тут, в Австралії, які змогли підтримати один одного через цей процес. Але ви хочете сказати, що нам потрібен якийсь спосіб підтримати ці групи, і підтримати цих людей, через наші власні інститути?<br/><br/>І я думаю, що ми повинні бути творчими. Це буде працювати для однієї школи і однієї парафії і однієї єпархії в одному напрямку, а для інших по-іншому. Оскільки ті, хто залишився в живих, з якими я постійно контактую, мають дуже схожі прохання і схожий досвід щодо того, щоб їх приймали в Церкві чи ні, відчуваючи, що їх виганяють або відкидають. Але вони також мають між собою зовсім різні очікування. Тому я дізнався, що ви також повинні бути дуже готовими прийняти відмінності в тому, що ця конкретна група, або цей конкретний вижив, хоче, просить і потребує.<br/><br/>М: Ті, хто вижив, говорять про бажання, щоб їхні історії були почуті та визнані. У нас була Королівська комісія тут, в Австралії, яка забезпечила незалежний процес, де жертви могли виступити. Чи потрібно щось подібне з точки зору процесу істини, справедливості та примирення для Церкви на міжнародному рівні?<br/><br/>H: Так, я думаю, що є потреба в цьому на міжнародному рівні. Але я думаю, що спочатку кожна помісна церква повинна зробити свою власну домашню роботу. Я не бачу, що дуже скоро буде створено якийсь такий собор або комісію, щоб досліджувати цю область для всієї Церкви. Церква налічує 1,3 мільярда членів і присутня в 190 країнах, з різного роду розбіжностями в очікуваннях щодо психологічної, духовної та фінансової підтримки.<br/><br/>Є одна річ, з якою я постійно стикаюся в спілкуванні, роботі та слуханні жертв, і це те, що вони хочуть, щоб їх слухали. Отже, якщо б було відчуття, що жертви постійно слухали - в Римі та в інших місцях - я думаю, що це дало б велике полегшення багатьом жертвам.<br/><br/>Я думаю, що занепокоєння Папи Франциска, особливо щодо вашого питання, полягає в тому, що помісні церкви роблять все можливе, щоб жертви були вислухані в цій конкретній країні. У мене є список людей, які хочуть говорити зі Святішим Отцем безпосередньо, і фізично це неможливо. Я був там у 2014 році, щоб перекласти для двох німецьких вцілілих, які були обрані з двома ірландськими і двома англійськими вцілілими, коли він отримав шість з них вдома. Він взяв весь ранок, слухаючи їх один за іншим. Для кожного з них він був там від 40 до 45 хвилин. Якби він робив це для кожного, хто вижив, він не міг би більше спати.<br/><br/>Його приклад є моделюванням для всієї Католицької Церкви того, як жертви та ті, хто вижив, приймаються, приймаються та вислуховуються. Я думаю, що якби єпископи і провінціали в цьому світі, у всіх країнах, наслідували його приклад, багато хто з тих, хто вижив, були б дійсно вдячні за це.<br/><br/>Архієпископ Діармуд Мартін нещодавно цитувався перед Всесвітньою зустріччю сімей, про Папську комісію, кажучи, що вона занадто мала, оскільки вона в даний час створена для досягнення того, що їй потрібно досягти. Що ви думаєте про це? Чи повинна Церква вкладати більше ресурсів у те, як вона контролює ці питання?<br/><br/>На даний момент ми нараховуємо 16 членів з практично всіх континентів і основних мовних груп. Ми представляємо різні дисципліни та професії, і мета комісії - як тільки що оприлюднені статути - надати пораду Святішому Отцеві.<br/><br/>Поширене непорозуміння щодо комісії полягає в тому, що ми спочатку розглядаємо випадки звинувачень. Це не так. Ми не маємо юридичної або адміністративної влади щодо справ, тому що, коли мова йде про звинувачення в зловживаннях, трибунали і процедура встановлені.<br/><br/>Друге непорозуміння полягає в тому, що ми безпосередньо просуваємо речі на місцях. Наша перша і головна мета полягає в тому, щоб ми консультували Святішого Отця з питань.<br/><br/>Тому, з моєї точки зору, так, ми повинні інвестувати більше. Але ми повинні інвестувати більше на місцевому рівні, і ми повинні переконатися, що пропозиції Папської Комісії передаються Святішому Отцю, що зазвичай робить Президент, а потім відбувається подальший процес, який відображає те, що ми дали в якості нашої поради.<br/><br/>В Австралії Catholic Professional Standards Limited здійснює нагляд за реакцією Церкви та надає керівні принципи та підтримку для забезпечення того, щоб всі установи в Церкві були дитячими безпечними установами. Чи потрібна якась організаційна підтримка з боку Риму для тих єпископів і єпархій, які намагаються сформувати ці інститути і забезпечити безпеку в цих єпархіях?<br/><br/>Я думаю, що в кінцевому підсумку комісія буде розвиватися в цьому напрямку. Зараз вони набирають експертів у цих областях.<br/><br/>Я думаю, що Церква повинна розуміти, що помісні церкви можуть вчитися один від одного взаємно. І моє розуміння завжди було - і я думаю, що Святіший Отець нагадав нам - що Церква не буде функціонувати як централізована компанія. Це не працює так, ефективно. Кожен єпископ, кожна конференція єпископів, має, певною мірою, своє життя. Що нам потрібно дізнатися більше, це відкрити канали взаємного спілкування.<br/><br/>Є ряд речей, які люди звинувачують у зловживанні в Церкві. Як священик і психолог, і як людина, яка зустрічалася і працювала з тими, хто вижив, які ваші думки з цього питання?<br/><br/>Я думаю, що питання про те, звідки беруться зловживання, є найважливішим, і Папа звернувся до цього в своєму листі до Божого народу, опублікованому 20 серпня. Він говорить у першому абзаці, і повторює це знову і знову, що питання сексуального насильства завжди пов'язане — або майже завжди пов'язане — не тільки з питанням зловживання владою, але і з зловживанням сумлінням.<br/><br/>Таким чином, справжнє фундаментальне питання насильства набагато складніше, ніж просто сексуальність - будь то гетеросексуальна або гомосексуальна. Це питання влади, і там ми повинні дійсно працювати над питанням про те, як ми розуміємо священство, як ми розуміємо єпископство, як ми розуміємо і проживаємо наші служіння? Які кордони?<br/><br/>Ось чому я дуже радий, що єзуїтська провінція в Австралії встановлює Кодекс поведінки, тому що ми говоримо не тільки про сексуальне насильство над неповнолітніми. Ми говоримо про сексуальне насильство над дорослими, і ми говоримо про насильство іншими способами - наприклад, зловживання совістю, коли ви диктуєте комусь, що ви думаєте, або ви вдаєте, що знаєте Бога, і ви можете сказати іншій людині: "Вам потрібно це зробити", проти совісті цієї людини.<br/><br/>Багато людей думають, що целібат призводить до зловживань. Як я завжди кажу, безшлюбність як така не є причиною для зловживань - в іншому випадку, як ми можемо пояснити, що 99,9% всіх зловмисників не живуть безшлюбним життям, і як ми можемо пояснити, що 95 або 96 відсотків всіх священиків не зловживають неповнолітніми? Але безшлюбність, або обітниця цнотливості, яка насправді не є інтегрованою, яка насправді не живе належним чином - так, це створює проблему. Іноді люди беруться за пияцтво, іноді вони беруться за азартні ігри, а іноді вони беруться за сексуальні проступки, з дорослими і з неповнолітніми.<br/><br/>Справжнє питання полягає в тому, як ми маємо справу з поняттям релігійної духовної влади, з якою священики та єпископи наділяються?

| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Я не здивований цим невідповідністю. Насправді, я навіть зайду так далеко, щоб сказати, що це не те, що коли-небудь зміниться, і ми не повинні всі запарюватися про зміну його. Через 10 років ми все ще матимемо кривавий край, складні пункти в списку найбільших проблем, і речі, які ми нарешті отримаємо, щоб зрозуміти, будуть основними частинами наших витрат.<br/><br/>Тепер, Гуннар і Енді обидва мають відмінні бали, зокрема про ІТ-команди бачать ІТ-проблеми і вирішувати їх за допомогою ІТ-рішень; насправді, я впевнений, що їх бали заслуговують.<br/><br/>Але я думаю, що є й інші ідеї, які перевершують ці (я коментував їх блоги про це, а пізніше вирішив, що я повинен просто вести блог тут). Ці три основні проблеми кровоточиво нові такі:<br/><br/>Ми боїмося нових речей, тому що не розуміємо їх, або не розуміємо їх, тому що вони нові.<br/><br/>Вони занадто нові для нас, щоб мати тверді підходи до їх вирішення.<br/><br/>вони занадто нові для нас, щоб знати, якщо ми повинні бути стурбовані чи ні! ми схильні за замовчуванням до параноїдального / занепокоєння, що добре!<br/><br/>занадто нові, щоб їм призначалися очевидні бюджетні пункти. Чи можу я купити коробку або програмне забезпечення, яке забезпечує "безпеку хмари" або "безпеку соціальних мереж"?<br/><br/>вони настільки нові, що бізнес навіть не знає, як їх використовувати або що вони хочуть від них. Не кажучи вже про те, як ми можемо забезпечити їх, все ще зустрічаючи або, принаймні, не топчучи всі потреби бізнесу. Якщо бізнес навіть не знає, як їх використовувати, я не впевнений, що безпека в будь-якому положенні, щоб безпечно керувати цим використанням.<br/><br/>Слід також зазначити, що ці нові речі в значній мірі просуваються через consumerland і в бізнес, з ІТ як свого роду, "О, так", подумав. Брандмауери, AV, AM, Auth - це всі ІТ-відповіді на типові ІТ-проблеми. Звичайно, є різниця. Це також дуже суб'єктивні питання, на відміну від дуже об'єктивних елементів, таких як брандмауери, відомі шкідливі біти, поведінка, сигнатури, порти. Бізнес представляє дуже складні питання, які часто пов'язані з людьми (які ми не можемо виправити), і які часто не вписуються в загальні правила. Навіть якщо ми відвернемося від технічних рішень і присвятимо свій час вирішенню цих проблем, вони все одно не будуть акуратно вирішені. Аналогічно, коли доходить до тиску, чи можете ви мати і досягати цілей за допомогою брандмауерів? Чи можете ви показати поліпшення? Все це випливає з досить суб'єктивного нетехнічного аспекту цих питань. Своєрідна різниця між карткою звіту дитини та зворотним зв'язком, який ви отримуєте від конференції батьків-вчителів. Якщо у вас є дитина, з якою з них ви найбільше схильні не погоджуватися або не обов’язково вірити? (Відповідь суб’єктивна!)<br/><br/>Можна сказати, що це природний прогрес безпеки і технологій: від зміцнення технічного контролю до просування вгору по стеку до поведінки і людей. Звичайно, можна сказати, що ці 3 основні проблеми пробивають брандмауери та сегменти мережі, але це природа цих речей (соціальні медіа «пробивають» через брандмауер набагато відрізняються від мене, пробиваючи SSH-з'єднання для мосту моєї домашньої мережі; соціальні медіа схожі на * спосіб * Я використовую моє SSH-з'єднання після того, як утримування вже пробивається, тому що це необхідно; тобто соціальні мережі є способом 80).<br/><br/>По суті, всі ознаки вказують на те, що ця дихотомія не дивує. І я не думаю, що це ще одна ознака того, що ІТ / безпека робить це неправильно, або не узгоджується належним чином з бізнесом, або має технічний фон темної серверної кімнати. Я не кажу, що ми робимо все правильно або ми належним чином узгоджені, але вищезгадане не є гарним аргументом на підтримку теорії цих недоліків.<br/><br/>Тепер для дійсно великого стрибка. Я б порівняв поточне зростання мобільних обчислень, щоб бути настільки ж великим, як впровадження комп'ютерів в бізнес, а потім ПК / Інтернет в бізнес. Тепер, я не був поруч, коли сталося перше, і я не був в індустрії, коли революція персональних комп'ютерів охопила бізнес, але я б поклався, що це найближче порівняння до цих пір. Я можу навіть сказати те ж саме для соціальних медіа. Це прокляті нові, і вони є великими змінами, ніж просто залучення Mac або нового програмного забезпечення або якогось нового бізнес-процесу. |
