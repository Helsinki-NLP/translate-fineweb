| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Леклер<br/><br/>Історичний район Леклер, який колись називали «пригородом Едвардсвілла на південь», був заснований як кооперативна громада в 1890 році і залишався окремим селом до приєднання до міста Едвардсвілл в 1934 році. Газети і журнали по всій території Сполучених Штатів і Європи повідомляли про експеримент Леклера, особливо протягом перших 20 років його існування. У 1979 році, завдяки своїй унікальній історії, колишнє село було занесено до Національного реєстру історичних місць.<br/><br/>Компанія Leclair була заснована Нельсоном Олівером Нельсоном, виробником сантехніки в Сент-Луїсі, який протягом багатьох років прагнув поліпшити становище робітничого класу. Нельсон хотів поліпшити умови праці для своїх співробітників і забезпечити житлом біля заводів, щоб робітники та їхні сім'ї могли легко брати участь у рекреаційних та освітніх програмах, що пропонуються компанією безкоштовно. До 1890 року, ще перебуваючи в Сент-Луїсі, виробничі та дистриб'юторські підприємства компанії N. O. Nelson почали забезпечувати розподіл прибутку разом з освітніми та рекреаційними можливостями. Кооперативний експеримент Леклера принесе додаткові вигоди.<br/><br/>Коли співробітники Нельсона повідомили, що хочуть переїхати в сільську місцевість, представники компанії звернулися до лідерів невеликих міст у кількох містах Міссурі та Іллінойсу поблизу їх штаб-квартири в Сент-Луїсі. Вони шукали підходящу нерухомість для будівництва нових заводів і зразкового селища. На південь від Едвардсвілля вони знайшли ділянку землі площею 125 акрів з доступом до води, вугілля та транспорту. Місцеві бізнесмени діяли швидко, щоб запропонувати фінансовий стимул. Менш ніж за три тижні громада зібрала фонд у розмірі 20 000 доларів з індивідуальних внесків у розмірі від 1 до 1000 доларів, щоб спонукати Нельсона вибрати Едвардсвілл для свого підприємства.<br/><br/>Міські лідери сподівалися знайти нерухомість в межах міста Едвардсвілл, але коли не вдалося знайти відповідне місце, вони були впевнені, що інвестиція Нельсона на південь від міста незабаром стане частиною Едвардсвілла. Хоча Нельсон виконав всі непередбачені умови для будівництва та створення робочих місць у своєму контракті, пройде 44 роки до анексії Едвардсвілля. Леклер, обмежений Медісон-Браун-авеню на сході, залізничними коліями на заході, Хедлі-Маккінлі-авеню на півдні і Вулф-стріт на півночі, залишався незалежним селом з 1890 по 1934 рік. За цей час він заробив репутацію інновацій в бізнесі, освіті та житловому плануванні.<br/><br/>Село Леклер на мапі Едвардсвілла 1931 року (англ.)<br/>Створення Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>До кінця 1880-х років він був міжнародним лідером у сфері співпраці та розподілу прибутку, обмінюючись соціальними теоріями з іншими по всьому світу, розширюючи свій бізнес у Сент-Луїсі. Він назвав своє експериментальне село на честь паризького ділителя прибутків, Едме Жана Леклера, але він відвідав багато інших соціальних візіонерів, які надавали інформацію та натхнення. Складаючи найкращі ідеї з цих прикладів, Нельсон заснував Леклера, щоб, за його словами, «давати роботу, сприяти інтелекту, забезпечувати відпочинок, виховувати красу та будувати будинки». Це були всі фактори, які він визначив, необхідні для чоловіків, щоб вести повноцінне життя. Пізніші письменники використовували ці слова, щоб сформулювати основоположні принципи Леклера: робота, будинки, освіта, відпочинок і краса, але з додатковим важливим принципом свободи.<br/><br/>Робота<br/><br/>Роботу можна вважати найважливішим з цих факторів, оскільки без заводських робочих місць в Леклері не було б села. Будівлі цегляного заводу були спроектовані архітектором Е. А. Камероном для забезпечення природного освітлення, вентиляції влітку та підлоги з підігрівом взимку. Існувала система пожежогасіння і, хоча аварії на виробництві не були ліквідовані, було зроблено все можливе, щоб гарантувати безпеку працівників. Покриті плющем цегляні будівлі були оточені добре манірованними газонами та квітниками, що надають комплексу вигляд кампусу. У 1894 році репортер New York World Неллі Блай назвала будівлі «ідеальною досконалістю будівель для людини».<br/><br/>Виробничий комплекс Виробничого підприємства імені Н. О. Нельсона в Леклері.<br/>Друзі Леклера<br/><br/>Політика компанії Nelson була розроблена для захисту фінансової стабільності співробітників. Робітники могли заробляти частку прибутку і мати голос в компанії, якщо вони вибрали цей варіант. План розподілу прибутку дав співробітникам Нельсона гордість за власність, що призвело до підтримки робочої сили. Протягом багатьох років було кілька короткочасних страйків робітників, але в більшості випадків проблеми з працею були рідкісними. Робітники також мали розумний робочий день і конкурентну заробітну плату. Існував резервний фонд, який передбачав пенсії та відпустку по хворобі, а також пенсії для вдів, якщо працівник помер, незалежно від того, чи була смерть пов'язана з його роботою.<br/><br/>Штаб-квартира N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) залишилася в Сент-Луїсі, але вся N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company була перенесена в Леклер. Виробнича компанія була розділена на магазини, які виробляли різноманітну продукцію. У 1900 році магазини стали незалежними компаніями для податкових цілей, але всі вони все ще належали N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Кваліфіковані майстри, які працювали тут, також виконували спеціальні контракти, включаючи клітки касира для місцевого банку та вівтар, який все ще використовується в Єпископальній церкві Святого Андрія в Едвардсвіллі. Мармуровий магазин спеціалізувався на архітектурному мармурі, який був вирізаний і встановлений екіпажами Нельсона в будинках, підприємствах і навіть державних капітоліях по всьому Середньому Заходу. Машинний магазин, який став Bignall і Keeler, виробляв трубоукладальні машини, насоси, датчики та різні механічні інструменти, які очікували в торгівлі сантехнікою. Вони також розгалужилися для виробництва спеціальних предметів, таких як велосипед Леклера в середині 1890-х років. Латунний цех включав ливарню, де виготовлялися різні сантехнічні труби та інструменти. Ці приклади представляють лише деякі з робіт, виконаних на заводах Леклера. Логотип компанії був стилізованим «NONCO», який все ще можна побачити на сантехнічних приладах і деяких пожежних гідрантах в Едвардсвіллі сьогодні.<br/><br/>Житлові будинки<br/><br/>Перш ніж будинки могли бути побудовані, житло було потрібно для робітників, які закінчували будівлі заводу, а також будувати будинки. Щоб задовольнити ці потреби, компанія побудувала «Клубний будинок», велику будівлю, яка служила багатьом цілям. Крім житла, це була перша навчальна будівля громади, і в ній була добре укомплектована бібліотека.<br/><br/>Будівництво житлової частини Леклера почалося відразу після того, як село було засноване в червні 1890 року. Юліус Піцман, інноваційний ландшафтний архітектор, який розклав перші лоти в Леклері, встановив для них ряд захисних заповітів. Заповіти передбачали широкі, криволінійні вулиці, великі ділянки та обмеження, яке обмежувало власність лише житловими або освітніми цілями. Компанія прокладала вулиці, забезпечувала електричні вуличні ліхтарі, встановлювала тротуари і висаджувала сотні дерев уздовж вулиць Леклера. Пізніші секції Леклера були викладені з традиційним дизайном сітки та меншими партіями, але все ще включали обмеження на дії.<br/><br/>Леклер Вікторіанський котедж в 1907 році.<br/>Створення Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Спочатку будинки були побудовані компанією, а потім продані майже за вартістю співробітникам Нельсона, щоб заохотити власника будинку. Якщо працівник захворів і не міг зробити іпотеку, виплати були призупинені до тих пір, поки він не повернувся до роботи. Будинки були запропоновані в різних конструкціях будинків, і компанія рекламувала, що немає двох будинків, схожих. Перші будинки були в основному вікторіанськими котеджами, які поставлялися з електрикою та проточною водою. За ними слідували бунгало, чотириквадратні і навіть деякі житлові будинки. Жителі могли придбати будинок, побудований компанією, або купити порожню ділянку і побудувати будинок самостійно, за умови, що архітектурний дизайн відповідає стандартам компанії.<br/><br/>У більш пізні роки лоти були продані інвесторам, зазвичай жителям Едвардсвілла, і багато будинків у 1920-х роках були побудовані місцевими підрядниками, які потім продали їх місцевим жителям.<br/><br/>Освіта<br/><br/>Нельсон вірив в освіту для всіх, включаючи робочий клас. Освітнє програмування почалося з дитячого садочка в Клубному будинку в 1892 році і продовжилося в новому навчальному будинку за адресою 722 Holyoake Road. Ця будівля, яку зазвичай називають «Шкільним будинком», забезпечувала великий зал для зустрічей та програм, але мала пересувні перегородки, щоб розділити його на класну кімнату протягом дня. Вечорами були танці, зустрічі або програми клубу самокультури Леклера, в яких щотижневі лекції проводили професори Вашингтонського університету або відомі на національному рівні оратори, які, як і Н. О. Нельсон, були частиною руху за соціальне покращення на рубежі століть. Серед них були Джейн Аддамс, Едвард Еверетт Хейл, Семюел «Золоте правило» Джонс та авторка Шарлотта Перкінс Гілман.<br/><br/>Діти навчалися в дитячому садку Леклера в 1913 році.<br/>Створення Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Протягом десяти років після будівництва будівлі освіти в 1895 році була проведена серія освітніх експериментів, включаючи промислову школу, коледж, вечірню школу та академію. Найпершим і найдовшим заходом був ранковий дитячий садок, заснований в 1892 році, який використовував модель Фребеля. Ця дворічна програма була безкоштовною для всіх, включаючи дітей Едвардсвілла, до 1931 року, коли з фінансових причин компанія почала стягувати плату за навчання для студентів, які не були дітьми співробітників. Nelson Manufacturing управляв дитячим садком до 1934 року, коли будівля була передана шкільному округу Едвардсвілл за номінальну плату.<br/><br/>Відпочинок<br/><br/>Мореплавці на озері Леклер, 1915 рік<br/>Створення Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Відпочинок був важливою особливістю Леклера. Компанія надала спортивні приміщення для бейсболу, тенісу, а пізніше і футболу. Було побудовано боулінг і більярдний зал, а взимку було озеро для катання на човнах, плавання, риболовлі або катання на ковзанах. Парк Леклер був облаштований човновими будинками, чоловічими та жіночими лазнями та великим павільйоном. Жителі організовували танці, сайриди, орфографічні бджоли та інші заходи, а компанія спонсорувала гурт, який регулярно грав на розвагах у селі або в Едвардсвіллі. Подібно до освітніх функцій у клубному будинку та школі, оздоровчі заклади в Леклері були відкриті для всіх і часто були місцем призначення для відвідувачів Едвардсвілла та навіть Сент-Луїса.<br/><br/>Краса<br/><br/>Ранні фотографії озера Леклер<br/>Створення Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Останній з факторів, які Нельсон вважав важливими для задоволення життя, стосувався навколишнього середовища. Нельсон знав про важливість здорового способу життя. Він цінував красу і чистоту, які можна було знайти в країні, і заохочував всіх в Леклері прикрасити своє майно, посадивши сади і сади. Сам Нельсон керував прикладом, тому компанія теплиця забезпечила безкоштовні квіти і конкурси були проведені для найкрасивіших дворів. Леклер був викладений так, що вся село було парк, як і раніше видно сьогодні.<br/><br/>Свободи<br/><br/>Кооперативний магазин Leclaire<br/>Створення Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Нельсон перерахував п'ять основоположних принципів для Leclaire, але сучасні письменники додають шостий: Свобода. Всі програми, пропоновані компанією, були доступні як для співробітників, так і для місцевих жителів, але жоден з них не був обов'язковим. Свобода вибору, брати чи не брати участь у програмах компанії, повністю залежить від людини. Жителі Леклера могли працювати на Nelson Manufacturing або в іншому місці, а працівники не були зобов'язані жити в Леклері. Участь у рекреаційних та освітніх програмах також була необов'язковою. Був також фірмовий магазин, де співробітники могли робити покупки, але, на відміну від інших фірмових містечок, ніхто не був у боргу перед фірмовим магазином. Магазин Leclair був кооперативом, де члени стягували справедливі ринкові ціни, але потім отримували щоквартальні дивіденди.<br/><br/>Різне місто компанії<br/><br/>Всі ці переваги зробили Leclaire унікальним серед інших міст компанії. Але були також окремі випадки, коли компанія виявляла співчуття і турботу про співробітників. Компанія закрила заводи і найняла екскурсійні поїзди, щоб доставити робітників і їх сім'ї в Сент-Луїс на один день на Всесвітній виставці 1904 року. Коли гроші були обмежені, Нельсон іноді розміщував додаткові гроші в кожному конверті заробітної плати, щоб полегшити життя працівникам, і якщо він запровадив програму, з якою чоловіки не погоджувалися, вони говорили про це, і, як часто, Нельсон змінював себе.<br/><br/>Народився в Ліллесанді, Норвегія, в 1841 році, Н. О. Нельсон був складною людиною. Він був капіталістом, який вірив у вільне підприємництво, але також і соціалістом, послідовником «золотого правила» і патріотом, який служив для Союзу в Громадянській війні. До 1900 року він був мультимільйонером, але до моменту своєї смерті в 1922 році він віддав все це на благо робітничого класу.<br/><br/>Хоча Леклер не був єдиним соціальним експериментом Нельсона, він вважається його найуспішнішим зусиллям. Інші великі зусилля для соціального поліпшення включали мережу кооперативних продуктових магазинів в Новому Орлеані, дитячий садок для дітей чорношкірих працівників в його Бессемер, штат Алабама, заводи і будинок для споживачів в Індіо, штат Каліфорнія.<br/><br/>Селище Нельсона в Леклері було відоме на міжнародному рівні як примітний і успішний експеримент. Вона була описана в Нью-Йорку неодноразово, але, зокрема, репортером Неллі Блай в 1894 році, який писав про зразкове місто, де «трудове питання вирішене, і всі щасливі в маленькому селі недалеко від Сент-Луїса». Los Angeles Times також регулярно повідомляла про Н. О.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Автор Відвідування через Zoom або Skype<br/><br/>Я радий відвідати з вашими учнями через Zoom або Skype! Skype є відмінним варіантом для шкіл / класів, які не залучають особисто авторів, але які хочуть досліджувати книги та поезію, спілкуватися з автором та задавати питання один на один.<br/><br/>Вартість<br/><br/>Я пропоную 30-45-хвилинні відвідування Zoom або Skype зі школами за 125 доларів за сесію (або 200 доларів за дві сесії, що відбуваються протягом трьох годин вранці або вдень; 325 доларів за три сесії в один день; 425 доларів за чотири сесії в один день). На кожній сесії я намагаюся залучити дітей якомога активніше. Ні, це не такий же зв'язок, як особистий візит, але він все ще може надихати і мотивувати дітей!<br/><br/>Що я роблю<br/><br/>Кожна сесія до 50 студентів включає:<br/><br/>5 хвилин технічних налаштувань<br/><br/>3 сегменти по 10 хвилин кожен — Ви вибираєте з:<br/><br/>Як я став письменником<br/><br/>Написання цієї конкретної книги (ви вибираєте, на якій книзі я зосереджуся)<br/><br/>Читання (я читаю деякі вірші, а діти допомагають мені читати інші)<br/><br/>Презентація в класі (ваші студенти ставили на читання або виступ для мене - дуже вдячна аудиторія!)<br/><br/>Написати поезію разом<br/><br/>Сеанс запитань та відповідей<br/><br/>5 хвилин на прощання / Goodbyes<br/><br/>Я також спілкуюся з класами вчителів перед службою або групами вчителів на службі про поезію та письмо.<br/><br/>Поради для чудового віртуального візиту<br/><br/>Поради для успішного віртуального візиту<br/><br/>Однією з моїх цілей для віртуальних відвідувань школи є захоплення інтерактивності, яка робить особисті відвідування успішними та веселими. Але правда в тому, що іноді важко бути віртуально інтерактивним! Час може не синхронізуватися правильно, що робить читання разом складним завданням, і мені дуже важко почути окремих студентів, якщо вони не підходять і говорять прямо в мікрофон / комп'ютер. Але після деяких проб і помилок, я виявив деякі способи, щоб мати кращі віртуальні відвідування можливо. Ось вони: 10 способів зробити мій візит з вашими учнями великий досвід!<br/><br/>Перед відвідуванням<br/><br/>Отримайте дітей, як це можливо про візит. Відвідайте мій веб-сайт з ними. Прочитайте деякі з моїх книг з ними. Зберіть деякі питання, студенти мають для мене. Все, що ви робите заздалегідь, щоб зробити його відчувати себе як велика угода буде йти довгий шлях до участі студентів.<br/><br/>Розташуйте відеокамеру або ноутбук з веб-камерою, щоб я міг бачити якомога більше аудиторії. Важко оцінити участь студентів, коли я можу бачити лише пару студентів.<br/><br/>Обмежте кожну групу до 50 студентів. Це неймовірно важко залучити великі групи за допомогою відео.<br/><br/>Я швидко перейду від теми до теми або вірша до вірша. Будь ласка, нагадайте студентам, що їм потрібно уважно слухати, щоб зрозуміти, що відбувається.<br/><br/>Іноді я роблю маленький театр читача зі студентами. Якщо я посилаю вам будь-які написані студентські частини заздалегідь, надрукуйте копію для кожного сеансу і розрізати на шматки, якщо це необхідно.<br/><br/>Під час візиту<br/><br/>Коли я обговорюю книгу, якщо у вас є ця друкована книга, будь ласка, тримайте її для студентів, щоб побачити.<br/><br/>Ви мій посередник. Я часто не можу зателефонувати студентам і почути індивідуальні відповіді. Отже, я можу сказати: "Ми збираємося отримати 3 ідеї. Підніміть руку, якщо у вас є ідея". Тоді ВИ приймаєте владу, телефонуєте трьом учням і оголошуєте ці відповіді всім у кімнаті і мені.<br/><br/>Виберіть впевнені, вихідні студенти для сценарних студентських частин (якщо я відправляю будь-який заздалегідь). Під час моїх особистих шкільних візитів я намагаюся залучити деяких з менш впевнених учнів, але я виявив, що це не працює так само добре під час віртуальних візитів, тому що я не можу їх чути.<br/><br/>Учні з промовистими частинами сидять попереду. Коли прийде час, попросіть їх встати і нагадати їм, щоб вони говорили голосно.<br/><br/>У віртуальних візитах управління поведінкою падає виключно на вас. Я часто не можу точно побачити, що відбувається, тому, будь ласка, вступайте за необхідності. Якщо є велике порушення, просто попросіть мене затриматися на мить, щоб я не балакав, поки ніхто не звертає уваги:>)<br/><br/>Не соромтеся фотографувати мене на екрані і ділитися в соціальних мережах, хоча фотографії мене часто виглядають смішно, тому що я роблю смішні обличчя або щось ще, поки я читаю!<br/><br/>Якщо у вас є які-небудь питання, будь ласка, просто запитайте, або до або під час візиту!<br/><br/>Планування віртуального сеансу<br/><br/>Ви зацікавлені в плануванні віртуального візиту зі мною? Просто напишіть мені, щоб налаштувати дату, і ми підемо звідти |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Архів новин<br/><br/>Нова книга розглядає шляхи боротьби з ВІЛ-захворюваннями<br/><br/>2011-11-29. (англ.)<br/><br/>Професор Денніс Френсіс з Марджорі Хуман, яка розробила обкладинку книги «Дія на ВІЛ».<br/><br/>Пандемія ВІЛ виявила найкраще та найгірше в людях з точки зору реагування. З одного боку, вона викликала стигму та насильство, а з іншого боку, вона викликала конструктивні та сприятливі відповіді від різних людей та груп. У новій книзі «Дія на ВІЛ», під редакцією професора Денніса Френсіса, декана факультету освіти в Університеті вільної держави, розглядається, як драма може бути використана для сприяння життєво важливим соціальним змінам, а також індивідуальним поведінковим змінам.<br/><br/>Дія на ВІЛ пропонує систематичне дослідження драми як підходу до обговорення ВІЛ / СНІДу та пов'язаних з ним поглядів та поведінки. Книга є науковим текстом і включає в себе роботи близько двадцяти винятково творчих авторів. Авторами книги є, серед інших, професор Хейзел Барнс (Університет Вітватерсранда), Роб Паттман (Університет Стелленбоша) та Івонн Сліп з Університету Квазулу-Натал.<br/><br/>«Цей проект розпочався в 2009 році і присвятив багато часу тому, щоб зібрати разом творчих авторів. Дослідження, яке передається через книгу, є оригінальним і своєчасним і робить значний внесок у розмови про роль / s і значення драми у вирішенні проблем ВІЛ & СНІД", - говорить професор Френсіс. |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Стенограма тестування впливу пастки для привидів на блакитного краба, Callinectis Sapidus, в затоці Барнегат<br/><br/>Michael FranklinМорські польові методи16 вересня 2008<br/><br/>Я вирішила використати блакитного краба, Callinectus sapidus, для мого експерименту, тому що його вдосталь тут, у затоці Барнегат, і його відносно легко зловити.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus - це плаваючий краб Важливо для комерційних крабів м'якої луски, як комерційних, так і рекреаційних (Jivoff 2008) Основний метод крабування - це основний крабовий пастка<br/><br/>Примарні пастки виникають, коли пастка втрачена, але продовжує ловити організми (Breen 1990) Джон Внек каже, що в затоці Барнегат є легко 2000, оскільки C. sapidus настільки агресивний (Pollock 1998), що відбувається, коли вони застрягають у клітці без їжі, і який вплив це має?<br/><br/>Якщо C. sapidus потрапляє в пастку привидів, він буде мати канібалістські схильності, поки останній не помре від голоду.<br/><br/>Як ми дублюємо пастку привидів в лабораторії?Створіть пастку привидів, закривши входи дротяною сіткою та зв'язками на блискавціОдного разу зразок завантажений, закрити верхню частину зв'язками на блискавці<br/><br/>Крабовий вхід закритий дротяною сіткою<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire КаттериRopeCameraZip Стяжки<br/><br/>Як ми отримуємо крабів?Пастка деякі кілька днів рано і голодувати їхОдного разу готові почати, збирати нові краби з пасткиДодати безпосередньо в пастку привида з 2 від голодного танка<br/><br/>Шість крабів всього, один відсутнійЗнайдено невеликий простір для втечі через; виправлено застібкою-застібкоюДва крабів мертвихУ одного залишилися кігтіІнші відсутні обидва весла та один кігтик<br/><br/>Чотири крабів живих і неушкодженихБільший мертвий краб не має змінБільший мертвий краб має тільки ділянку карапісу залишився<br/><br/>Останній день експериментуВзяли два зразкиНе змінюється з другого дня в першому зразкуДруге спостереження, більший карапік відокремлений від решти тіла / кіготь<br/><br/>Виходячи з результатів, я відкидаю свою нульову гіпотезу про те, що краби просто будуть в пастці. Результати показують, що вони канібалізували двох крабів в пастці, потім, принаймні на час мого тесту, були насичені.<br/><br/>Примарні пастки впливають на організми, що застрягли в них, а саме C. sapidus.C. sapidus не має проблем з канібалізмом, коли немає іншого джерела їжі. |

Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

З моменту першої появи Лари Крофт у відеогрі Tomb Raider (1996), її подвиги як авантюрного і розумного дослідника знайшли широкий резонанс у гравців, заробивши їй місце в пантеоні великих персонажів поп-культури. З цієї причини ми помістимо «Світ Лари Крофт» в Storyworld Spotlight з 22 грудня 2021 року по 6 березня 2022 року.<br/><br/>Створення Croft<br/><br/>Лара Крофт була створена студією Core Design, в Дербі (Великобританія), в 1996 році. Студія шукала головного героя для своєї майбутньої 3D пригодницької гри для PlayStation 1. Гра в перспективі від третьої особи, де гравці будуть бачити головного героя в повному обсязі протягом кожної сцени.<br/><br/>Оскільки гра була про «напад на таємничі гробниці глибоко під пірамідами», головний герой повинен був виглядати авантюрним і мати мізки, щоб пережити складні рейдові місії. Після деякого роздуму народилася Лара Крофт, молода, висококласна і абсолютно британська жінка, яка була такою ж загадковою і розумною, як і жорсткою і самодостатньою.<br/><br/>Успіх і суперечки<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) був відривним успіхом для Core Design, який швидко подвоївся на будівництві Tomb Raider 2 (1997) і 3 (1998). Велика частина успіху була приписана провідній леді ігор, яка знайшла шанувальників як з чоловічими, так і жіночими гравцями.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Нерухомість Слово дня: Варіант<br/><br/>Варіант: угода про те, щоб залишити відкритим, протягом певного періоду, пропозицію про продаж або оренду нерухомості. Варіант може бути використаний, наприклад, для того, щоб дати покупцеві час для вирішення питань фінансування, титулу, зонування та доцільності перед здійсненням покупцем покупки. Варіанти часто використовуються в процесі збору землі. Опціон повинен бути підкріплений його фактичним розглядом, окремим і незалежним від покупної ціни нерухомості. Простого розгляду питання про винагороду недостатньо, за винятком варіанту оренди, в якому положення договору оренди самі по собі є достатнім розглядом для підтримки цього варіанту. Опціон просто створює договірне право; він не дає опціоністу ніякої нерухомості в нерухомості. На момент підписання опціону власник не продає, а покупець не купує нерухомість. Хоча власник зобов'язаний продати, якщо покупець отримав повідомлення, покупець не зобов'язаний купувати. Опціон на покупку також відомий як дзвінок; опціон на продаж відомий як пут. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Користь каротиноїдів для шкіри<br/><br/>Ви чули про каротиноїди? Ці потужні фітохімічні речовини є пігментними компонентами, що містяться в рослинах, які дають квіти, фрукти та листя їх жовтого, помаранчевого та червоного кольорів.<br/><br/>З 1930-х років вчені виявили близько 800 каротиноїдів і близько 40 з них знаходяться в людському тілі, включаючи зовнішній шар епідермісу, дерму і підшкірний жир. Найпоширенішими каротиноїдами є бета-каротин, альфа-каротин, лютеїн, зеаксантин, лікопін і астаксантин. Детальніше про астаксантин можна прочитати тут.<br/><br/>На вміст каротиноїдів в шкірі впливають численні фактори, включаючи споживання фруктів і овочів, їх біодоступність з різних продуктів харчування, добавки, вплив УФ-випромінювання, забруднення повітря, споживання алкоголю, куріння та стрес.<br/><br/>Як каротиноїди допомагають шкірі?<br/><br/>Каротиноїди є одними з найвідоміших антиоксидантів для шкіри, і вони також мають важливі функції як протизапальні засоби.<br/><br/>Здоровий старіння і ремонт шкіри<br/><br/>Антиоксиданти мають важливе значення для здорової шкіри, оскільки вони допомагають запобігти пошкодженню клітин вільними радикалами. Ураження вільними радикалами викликає передчасне старіння та виникнення різних типів раку шкіри. Каротиноїди разом з вітаміном Е, вітаміном С і ферментом Co Q10 є важливими кірковими антиоксидантами.<br/><br/>Завдяки своїй антиоксидантній активності каротиноїди підтримують і заохочують вироблення колагену і еластину в шкірі. Це допомагає збільшити щільність шкіри, товщину, еластичність і твердість. Колаген і еластин зменшуються з віком, тому отримання достатньої кількості каротиноїдів в раціоні і місцево має вирішальне значення для гарного старіння.<br/><br/>Каротиноїди можуть поліпшити ознаки фотостаріння, знебарвлення шкіри, еластичність, гідратацію, текстуру, а також можуть зменшити трансепідермальні втрати води.<br/><br/>Астаксантин, зокрема, стимулює фібробласти виробляти колаген і еластин, пригнічує активність ферментів, які руйнують колаген і еластин, і демонструє протизапальну і УФ-фільтраційну дію. Було показано, що він зменшує меланін в шкірі, що призводить до зменшення появи веснянок і мелазми.<br/><br/>Анти-акне активність: протизапальна активність каротиноїдів допомагає пригасити запалення і подразнення, пов'язані з акне. Каротиноїди також допомагають нормалізувати і збалансувати виділення масла з сальних залоз. Вони є цінними агентами у відновленні шкіри і стимулюють регенерацію епідерми, допомагаючи розгладити і пом'якшити шкіру.<br/><br/>Де можна знайти каротиноїди?<br/><br/>Існує два способи отримання щоденної дози каротиноїдів: через дієту і через місцеве застосування. Поєднання обох є ідеальним підходом до догляду за шкірою.<br/><br/>Каротиноїди розчинні в жирі, тому ваш організм потребує жиру, щоб поглинати їх (наприклад, помідори і оливкова олія, брокколі і масло, або шпинат і авокадо). Поширеними джерелами каротиноїдів у їжі є авокадо, яєчні жовтки, капуста, шпинат, морква, солодка картопля, папайя та помідори.<br/><br/>Хоча ми виступаємо за отримання якомога більшої кількості поживних речовин та антиоксидантів з їжі, а не з добавок; одне дослідження показало, що астаксантин у поєднанні з гідролізатом колагену значно покращує цілісність бар'єру, знижує трансепідермальні втрати води та збільшує експресію проколлагену типу I мРНК.<br/><br/>Актуальне застосування є ключем до здорової шкіри. Дослідження показують, що високі концентрації антиоксидантів в шкірі людини пропонують найкращий захист для здорової шкіри в будь-якому віці.<br/><br/>У Sarka Botanicals ми змішуємо багаті на каротиноїди цілі рослини, такі як календула, кульбаба та екстракти, такі як астаксантин, з оліями холодного віджиму та функціональними інгредієнтами. Тільки календула містить понад 19 різних типів каротиноїдів. Це може пояснити, чому він має таку довгу історію використання в догляді за шкірою. Дослідження показують, що каротиноїди, змішані з коферментом Q10, особливо ефективні для зменшення запалення та уповільнення передчасного старіння шкіри через вплив сонця. |
