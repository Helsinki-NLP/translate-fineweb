| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Визнаючи, що неможливо переконати когось любити те, що вони ненавидять, і навпаки, часто приємно спробувати аргумент.

Незалежно від того, що говорить радіо, все одно є середина між "Ми повністю погоджуємося" і "Я правий, а ти дурний і злий".<br/><br/>Скотт: Після обговорення мого Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World Apostasy, ми шукали випадок, коли я можу викликати вас за те, що вам не подобається щось чудове, і нам не довелося довго шукати. Ми сиділи поруч один з одним під час «Угоми» Мартіна Скорсезе, вкрай зачаровані його фантастичною даниною чудесам раннього німого кіно, і ви, очевидно, протистояли йому на кожному кроці. Критичний консенсус був на моєму боці: він потрапив на 9-е місце в нашому колективі Top 15 (хоча ви перерахували його як свій переоцінений вибір), виграв (або розмістив) у різних нагородах кінокритиків і в даний час має 83 бали на Metacritic. Звичайно, це не означає, що ви помиляєтеся, але на вас лежить обов'язок пояснити, чому Гюго був, за вашими словами, "порожнім і штучним", де багато хто з нас бачив це як прекрасне спогад про дитинство Скорсезе і носія, коли він був ще в дитинстві. І будь ласка, будьте ніжні, як ви розірвати цей метелик за крила.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Таша: Я не можу бути ніжним, Скотт. Іноді це болить менше, якщо ви зірвати пластир все відразу. (І навіть якщо це не так, хто хоче ходити в напіврозірваному пластирі? Грубий.) Справа в тому, що я виявив, що Г'юго був втомливо маніпулятивним вправою в підробці, починаючи з його відкриття пролітати через паризький залізничний вокзал, який нагадував мені більше, ніж що-небудь з Роберта Земекіса Полярний експрес. На відміну від Майка Д'Анджело, я прихильник довгих, непорушних прийомів як способу створення простору і заохочення глядачів несвідомо затримати подих, коли камера досліджує область; але коли досліджуваний простір є гладким, блискучим творінням CGI, і камера плаває невагомо через нього без фізичного відчуття, що або камера, або оточення дійсно є, що дослідження починає відчуватися. І решта фільму відчувалася так само безпорадною і нереальною для мене, як з точки зору його обстановки, так і з точки зору його надуманої історії.<br/><br/>У мене не обов'язково є проблема з виробленими, стилізованими середовищами у фільмі. Мені сподобався не менш масштабний, абсолютно штучний погляд Баз Лурманна на Париж, наприклад, в Мулен Руж, але в цьому фільмі є відчуття власної безглуздості, почуття гумору про те, наскільки це навмисно надто. Стилізація Жан-П'єра Жюне, особливо в Амелі. (Обидва Жюне і Лурман відчували сильні візуальні впливи тут.) Однак у мене виникло відчуття, що Мартін Скорсезе хотів, щоб я сприймав Гюго цілком серйозно. Хоча це ще одна болюча сентиментальна історія про відважну сироту, яка повертає колір у життя сварливого старого сором'язливого. І я просто не міг.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Немає нічого, що мені більше подобається у фільмі, ніж здивування. І немає нічого, що я обурююся і опираюся більше, ніж відверто маніпулювати, голосно говорити, що відчувати і коли це відчувати. Хороший фільм робить такі речі тонко; поганий використовує ударні музичні сигнали та солодкі струни - і в цьому випадку, лисий, величезноокий, розпорошений сирота, який горестно дивиться на камеру - щоб вимагати пафосу та сказати глядачам, що вони жахливі люди, якщо вони не обслуговують його на вимогу. Тим не менш, я можу мати справу з сумними дітьми і сварливими дорослими, які роблять життя кращим один для одного - я дійсно вивчив Гавр цього року, який був по суті тим самим сюжетом без усієї симпатії - але я вважаю, що штучне середовище погано відбивається на штучних емоціях, і кожен робить іншого більш підробленим по черзі.<br/><br/>Давайте почнемо з цього. У нашому пропущеному відеоролику, ви і Ноель взяли Кита на захист тиранозавра, тому що ви відчували, що це було недостатньо реалістичним - занадто надуманим, занадто скупим, занадто багато, занадто далеко. Як це можливо, що ви не можете купити застряглий старий дивак, який ламає речі, коли він сердитий, але ви можете купити сироту, що живе всередині гігантського годинника залізничної станції і вирушає в примхливу подорож, щоб відремонтувати таємничий автомат, який, на його думку, може мати секрети від його померлого батька, але який замість цього веде його в примчудливе подорож самопізнання, в чарівну кіно? Ви ніколи не знаходили Г'юго безтурботним дизайном рококо, агресивним щипцем серцевих струн, або тачками з примхами, навіть трохи надмірними або важко ковтати?<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Скотт: Юнет і Лурман як вплив на Скорсезе?! Забудьте бути небайдужими, тепер ви навмисно тиснете мене гострою палицею. Якщо ви шукаєте натхнення для Гюго - насправді, якщо ви шукаєте емоційне ядро Гюго - ви повинні повернутися до дитинства Скорсезе на вулиці Елізабет в Маленькій Італії, де маленький хлопчик-астматик, не в змозі грати на вулиці з іншими дітьми, відступив до фантазій Олександра Корди, таких як «Багдадський злодій». Або, простіше кажучи, просто перейдіть прямо до самого джерела: Джордж Мельєс, чия «Подорож на Місяць» залишається великим вибухом усіх кінематографічних фантазій, того моменту, коли камера використовувалася не для документування світу, як він є, але будь-яке примхливе, чарівне, транспортне місце, яке режисер хоче винайти для нього. І ця традиція розвивалася і розширювалася протягом десятиліть, перш ніж такі люди, як Юнет і Лурман, отримали свої маленькі лапки на ньому.<br/><br/>І говорячи про Жюне, гарна спроба забрати мою риторичну зброю, але я все одно скажу: як можна любити Амелі, але знайти Гюго синтетичним і "надмірним" і "втомливо маніпулятивним"? Ви кажете, що Амелі і Мулен Руж відкупилися від "почуття власної безглуздості", де Скорсезе має на увазі, що ми сприймаємо Гюго серйозно, і я не думаю, що це так, принаймні в останньому пункті. Що Скорсезе відчуває очевидну пристрасть до фільмів, я думаю, тому ви б інтерпретували Г'юго як серйозного. Але для мене це ті почуття, які надають фільму емоційний баласт, якого немає у фільмах Лурмана та Юнета. Всі три фільми агресивно використовують чудеса CGI - і Скорсезе додає 3D до суміші, до чудового ефекту - але там, де ви і я відрізняємося, йдеться про проблему невагомості. Я згоден з тим, що CGI має ефект дистанціювання; світи, повністю складені з цифрового пластиліну, гнучкі до такої міри, що іноді не мають присутності. Ви згадали Г'юго у вашому "Переоціненому" записі для нашого Best Of Film piece як "CGI gimcrack" - ідеальний диск ... для іншого фільму.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Справедливо сказати, що Скорсезе побудував Хьюго навколо стандартного випуску, сюжету дитячої книги / фільму: сирота сумує за своїм татом, створює свій власний маленький світ фантазій, вривається в нового друга, переконує стару сукувату дурницю пом'якшити і, можливо, усиновити його. Але це лише сюжетний скелет, а Скорсезе дає багато плоті і крові. По-перше, ви не можете дивитися на самотнього хлопчика Гюго, який дивиться з годинникової вежі на вокзал Парижа, не думаючи про Скорсезе, іншого самотнього хлопчика, який дивиться з вікна своєї спальні на Елізабет-стріт. І навіть якщо ви не досить великий кіноботанік, щоб встановити цей зв'язок, я дійсно відчуваю, що подорож Хьюго полягає не в пошуку нової фігури батька, а в наполегливості з механічною магією, яка стоїть як спадщина його власного батька. Ось що таке кіно: Стійкість бачення, що дозволяє прийняти ілюзорну версію світу зі швидкістю 24 кадри в секунду — це наука і магія одночасно. Відносини Г'юго з Мельєсом не про те, що він затишно підходить до нового тата, але розділяє загальний ентузіазм, який старий занурив у гіркоту. Для мене це набагато більш унікальний кут на потенційно магазинному приміщенні.<br/><br/>Ви дійсно не знайшли жодного з Гюго чарівним? Навіть нечисленні недоброзичливці фільму, здається, готові визнати, що послідовності, що викликають історію кіно та студію Мельєса - з Майклом Стулбаргом як героїчним кінознавцем! - були приголомшливі. Це відчувалося, в кращому випадку, як нахабне стиснення моєї історії кіно 101 класу в коледжі, конденсуючи семестрове значення кліпів і контексту в щось між монтажем і анімованою спливаючою книгою. І це говорить про геніальний дизайн фільму, який переплітає факти і фантазії настільки красиво, що це одночасно історія Мельєса і народження кіно, і просто простий, розкішний кінематографічний диво, яке сам Скорсезе любив би в дитинстві. Слава Богу, Г'юго не слідує моделі Юнета/Люрманна і має «відчуття власної смішності». Як фентезійний цінитель себе, чи не сказав би ти, що є цінність в тому, щоб грати його прямо, серйозно і беззастережно, а не підмигувати аудиторії? Ви можете знайти Гюго хворобливо солодким, але я не думаю, що автентичність його почуття можна заперечити.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Таша: Так, я дійсно знайшла зачаровуючі частини Хьюго. (Зверніть увагу, як я відповідаю на ваше запитання, тоді як ви були занадто зайняті піною з апоплексією, щоб звернутися до моєї, хоча я припускаю, що це власна відповідь. Добре, «вплив» може бути перебільшенням справи - я просто мав на увазі, що візуальний стиль виглядав дуже знайомим. Хоча, як зазначив Кіт, коли ви підняли це особисто, Скорсезе не проти того, щоб черпати натхнення з візуальних ефектів інших людей, а також не застрахований від цього.) Перш за все, я був зачарований частинами, пов'язаними з передісторією Жоржа Мельєса, з його любов'ю до кіно, з роботою, яку він вклав у своє мистецтво, і радістю, яку він отримав від цього. Там дуже багато краси і веселощів в постановці сцени підводного двору з "Fairyland" Мельєса, і в послідовності в кінці, зосереджуючись на кадрах Мельєса. Дозвольте вам визнати, що зв'язок Гюго з Мельєсом через спільну любов до кіно - це приємний штрих. І мені подобається хороший фільм про кіномистецтво.<br/><br/>Але Гюго в першу чергу не про фільм, незважаючи на зв'язки Мельєса. На додаток до тем, які ви наводите, це також про те, щоб знайти свою мету, як персонажі явно, трудомістко пояснити один одному і нам. І це про видовище, і великі екшени, і погоні, і щасливі закінчення, де навіть розгніваний хуліган, і сором'язлива старша пара, і fergawdsakes, навіть капризна такса - все це до кінця поєднується з чарівними любовними інтересами. Йдеться про супер-дорогоцінну Герміону Грейнджер, яка є владною, веселою, розумною і хвалить магічні світи, вміщені в книгах. І все це дуже знайоме і потужне штучне.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Так, Скорсезе грає з архетипами. Проблема в тому, що я ніколи не відчував, що він наповнив їх чимось новим, свіжим або правдоподібним, незважаючи на його власну історію. Я б дуже віддав перевагу розповіді про молодого Скорсезе, який зростав з астмою - чимось маленьким і реальним, без величезних кімнат, повних CGI і золотих сяючих пилових мозолів і пророчих снів, і буйного дорослого тирана-охоронця з золотим серцем - все це величезна, надто дурниця. Ви продовжуєте посилатися на особисте походження Скорсезе і любов до кіно як доказ того, що він дійсно відчуває те, що він ставить на екран, але я не відчуваю його особистого дотику ні в чому з цього, за винятком моментів, які прямо про фільм. Основні емоції можуть бути реальними, але це не робить виконання менш хибним.<br/><br/>Ви кажете, що автентичність емоцій не можна заперечувати. Я не сумніваюся, що Скорсезе особисто відчував себе самотнім і ізольованим в дитинстві, але я не відчуваю самотності і ізоляції на екрані - я бачу купу перебільшених позначок (Хуго брудний, і його одяг носиться, і всі дорослі кричать на нього, і його регулярно переслідує страшна собака!) і великі удари, з криками і плачем. Для мене щирість більш переконлива і більш особиста, коли вона тиха і пряма; коли хтось кричить на мене свою думку, я припускаю, що він або дійсно сердитий, або просто намагається перевантажити мої почуття, щоб утримати мене від висловлювання власної думки. Гуго був одним довгим криком, наскільки я думав.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Чому я не отримав це відчуття підробки від Амелі, запитаєте ви? Насправді, я зробив. Я повністю визнаю, що Амелі і Мулен Руж є великими, маніпулятивними, штучними конструкціями в тому ж дусі, вимагаючи конкретних емоцій через певні проміжки часу і намагаючись продати ці емоції з важким емоційним і агресивним саундтреком. Жоден з них не продав мене за свої емоції як справжнє людське почуття. Те, що мені сподобалося в цих двох фільмах, було конструкцією, особливо сміховинні списки Амелі випадкових характеристик та досвіду для її акторського складу, а також музичні мішапи Мулен Руж та реконтекстуалізації. Мені часто продають історії, які роблять творчі або амбітні речі зі структурою, і обидва ці фільми кваліфікуються, де Г'юго є набагато більш лінійним, стандартним дитячим квестом.<br/><br/>Але, врешті-решт, для мене це дійсно зводиться до відчуття, що ці фільми - дурні, тоді як Г'юго потрібно сприймати серйозно в кожен тріаксний момент. Ви не думаєте, що це правда, але ви одночасно захищаєте її цілісність з точки зору абсолютно автентичної, вкоріненої в історії Скорсезе емоції, і говорите мені, що я неправий, і він не має на увазі, що це потрібно сприймати серйозно. Як ви поєднуєте ці два твердження? Що про фільм підказує вам, що він не призначений для того, щоб бути прийнятим за чисту монету? І чи можливо, що це просто ще один цікавий випадок Бенджаміна Баттона, схожий на ситуацію, коли я вважаю, що використання дітей у високобюджетних фільмах значною мірою смачним і мелодраматичним, тоді як ви, як тато, вважаєте, що це обходить ваш цинізм і йде прямо до вашого сімейного почуття?<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Скотт: Не впевнений, що я мав на увазі, що Скорсезе не має на увазі, щоб його сприймали серйозно; просто він вибрав примхливий транспортний засіб, через який можна висловити серйозну любов до фільмів. Коли ви кажете: "Але Гюго в першу чергу не про кіно, незважаючи на зв'язки з Мельєсом", я збентежений. Я визнаю, що ви знайдете багато елементів Г'юго надто знайомими і трудомісткими і повними Спілбергівських диво-емоцій - немає нічого, що я можу зробити, щоб сперечатися навколо цього сприйняття, яке поділяють інші сумнівники Г'юго. Іноді фільм означає зачаровувати і зачаровувати, і це не для деяких; у вас є Гюго, а у мене є Амелі, хоча я думаю, що останнє, навмисно штучне, як це є, означає для нас, щоб знайти його романтичним. (Замість того, щоб, скажімо, якийсь жахливий механічний пристрій, придатний для продовження Пила.)<br/><br/>Але сказати, що Г'юго не про кіно? Якщо це не про кіно, то це найбезглуздіша дискурсивна історія про те, про що ви думаєте, що я коли-небудь бачив. Відносини між Г'юго і Мельєсом є серцем фільму, і в основі цього лежить не просто зв'язок між відважним сиротою і жорстоким старим хлопцем з золотим серцем, а спільна близькість до інженерної магії - зокрема, магії фільмів. Я думаю, що Скорсезе і його співробітники знайшли спосіб висловити свій ентузіазм на початку кінематографа через фантазію, доступну для всіх віків. Наповнена архетипами дитяча казка - це просто корочка тут; кіно - це пиріг. (Ммм... пиріг.)<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Що стосується The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, я не бачу багато зв'язку, крім спроби викрити мене як захисника Benjamin Button як спосіб пошкодити мою довіру. (До речі, як статисти на цьому G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Я сказав вам, що позбавлений сну новий тато в мені був, можливо, вразливий для Бенджаміна Баттона, але я не можу уявити собі час, коли передумова старіння в зворотному напрямку не зрушить мене. І крім того, я не бачу, як Бенджамін Баттон має відношення до Г'юго як до фільму про дітей, оскільки це лише невеликий відрізок історії, яка охоплює набагато більшу траєкторію.<br/><br/>Так я переконав вас? Ймовірно, ні. Але я радий дізнатися, що Гюго не був повністю позбавлений чар для вас. Послідовності на Мел'єс режисер є тим, що поставило Гюго для мене - і в цьому, принаймні, ми можемо поділитися деяким кіно любові.<br/><br/>Реклама<br/><br/>Таша: Ні, я не можу сказати, що ви мене переконали, так само, як я вас переконала. Неможливо нікого переконувати у вісцеральній любові до чого-небудь, і це дійсно повинно бути так само неможливо говорити когось від вісцеральної любові. Здебільшого, ви дозволили мені побачити Г'юго в «Скотт-О-Віжн», що є цікавим досвідом; принаймні зараз я м'яко переконаний, що нам не вдалося якимось чином побачити абсолютно різні фільми, які так чи інакше мали одне й те ж ім'я та режисера.<br/><br/>Ми, звичайно, мали різний досвід, хоча, на мій погляд, зосередилися на різних аспектах виробництва: я все ще не бачу тему «фільм чудовий» як єдину нитку фільму, стільки, скільки один серед занадто багатьох. "Безглуздо дискурсивний" майже охоплює його, хоча я б кинув "часто непотрібно милий і дорогоцінний" поверх цього. У той час як ви зосереджені на смачній начинці пирога фільму, я відчуваю, що цей пиріг був покритий фунтом кристалізованого цукру, і я думаю, що це має значення, незалежно від основного повідомлення фільму або жменьки приголомшливих сцен. Дивіться також Бенджамін Баттон, якого я виховував не просто для того, щоб вас дратувати - я дійсно думаю, що у вас більше сентиментальної смуги, ніж у мене, щодо дітей у кіно, особливо коли вони використовуються більше як символи вразливості та невинності, ніж як людські персонажі. Гей, ви знаєте, який фільм зовсім не має милих широкооких мотузок, що приносять надію в цинічний світ? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Можливо, я піду дивитися ці додаткові Blu-ray. Я міг би використовувати вибух-інсулін, щоб компенсувати солодкість Хьюго. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | «Я сподівався, що моя дочка буде вільна від важких і тривожних часів»: історія Мі Мі як мами-біженці<br/><br/>Надія в часи кризи: історія дня матері<br/><br/>Джудіт Сантьяго*<br/><br/>Мі Мі почула, що солдати йдуть. Вона захопила свого сина і шалено приєдналася до решти селян, які бігли до тайсько-бірманського кордону, де знаходилося Управління Верховного комісара ООН у справах біженців (УВКБ). Після того, як переслідування солдатів закінчилося, Мі повернулася додому в своє маленьке село в Коечі, Бірма.<br/><br/>Протягом 1997-2000 років Мі і тисячі їй подібних жили під постійною загрозою насильства з боку бірманських солдатів. Багато людей знайшли тимчасовий притулок в джунглях і повернулися додому в своє село після того, як солдати покинули район, просто щоб зробити це знову через кілька днів. Приблизно раз на тиждень Мі та інші були в дорозі, щоб уникнути захоплення, згвалтування або смерті від солдатів.<br/><br/>Під час одного інциденту чоловік Мі побіг попереду своєї дружини, щоб забезпечити їжу для своєї сім'ї. Куля розбила частину його грудної клітки, залишивши його важко пораненим і в біді, коли він їхав до джунглів зі своєю сім'єю для безпеки.<br/><br/>Протягом трьох місяців чоловік Мі сховався і перевіз сім'ю з дратівливою раною на боці. Він не отримав ніякої медичної допомоги, за винятком догляду за Мі.<br/><br/>- Я боялася повернутися до Бірми, - сказала Мі через перекладача. - Я боялася померти. Я плакала і плакала кожен день, - продовжувала вона.<br/><br/>Чоловік Мі врешті-решт набрав достатньо сил, щоб п'ять днів йти до невеликого села в Таїланді, де вони дізналися про розташування лікарні та табору біженців. Коли Мі та її чоловік нарешті прибули до лікарні, він переніс негайну операцію, а потім одужав.<br/><br/>Символ надії<br/><br/>Життя в джунглях для тих бірманських солдатів було дійсно страшним і важким. Тимчасовим житлом стали тимчасові намети з бамбука з дахом і підлогою. Багато жінок, включаючи Мі, народжували дітей в джунглях. Тодішній шестирічний син Мі допомагав у доставці своїй сестрі на ім'я Ех Ку Хсер. Його ім'я означає любов - холод - солодкий. "Холод" в бірманській культурі означає так, щоб не пройти через вогонь життя, так як спека представляє неспокійні часи.<br/><br/>"Я сподівалася, що моя дочка буде вільна від важких і тривожних часів," сказала Мі. "Я не хотіла, щоб вона пройшла через те, що я пережила", продовжувала вона.<br/><br/>Для Мі народження дочки серед темряви, мук і страху було символом надії на нове життя.

Організація допомагає жінкам-біженці, які втекли з зон конфлікту, відновити своє життя за допомогою мистецтва виготовлення свічок. Му Кхо рекомендував Мі приєднатися до організації, і Мі з радістю погодився.<br/><br/>"Я була схвильована, щоб бути поза домом," сказала Мі, "Я була вихована, щоб повірити, що, оскільки я була жінкою, моя роль полягала в тому, щоб залишитися вдома і виховувати свою сім'ю", - продовжила вона. «Хоча багато бірманських жінок хочуть зробити більше для себе, їх часто заохочують залишатися домогосподарками».<br/><br/>Сьогодні Мі планує зайнятися виготовленням свічок для себе і підтримати своїх п'ятьох дітей, але вона висловила потребу спочатку вивчити англійську мову.<br/><br/>"У таборі тайських біженців у нас була освіта, але це було не так добре, - сказала Мі. - Коли я була дитиною, я хотіла ходити до школи, але мені сказали залишитися вдома, тому що я була жінкою.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Прецедентний есе<br/><br/>1562 слів - 7 сторінок<br/><br/>Позитивні дії - це державна політика, яка надає можливості меншинам, жінкам і будь-якій групі, яка стала жертвою дискримінації в минулому. Позитивні дії є результатом руху за громадянські права 1960-х років, який виріс з Закону про громадянські права 1964 року, який заборонив дискримінацію за ознакою раси, етнічної приналежності або статі. Це було рішення Верховного суду 1978 року «Регенти Каліфорнійського університету проти Бакке», яке дозволило використовувати переваги на основі раси як засіб сприяння різноманітності, що дозволило використовувати позитивні дії в політиці прийому. Він був створений з метою забезпечення рівних можливостей для представників меншин в освіті та ... перегляду середини документа ...<br/><br/>Однак, згідно з доповіддю 2007 року дослідницького центру Pew, підтримка позитивних дій серед американської громадськості істотно зросла в останні роки, з 58% в 1995 році до 70% в 2007 році. Прихильники позитивних дій роблять багато аргументів на підтримку позитивних дій, в надії змусити інших побачити справжнє благо, яке позитивна політика дій приносить нашому суспільству. Прихильники вважають, що позитивні дії - це більше процес, ніж політика прийому. Коледжі та університети беруть на себе додаткову ініціативу, щоб звернутися до груп меншин, заохочуючи їх застосовувати. Коледжі та університети пропонують додаткову фінансову допомогу та надають ресурси на кампусі, щоб допомогти поліпшити освіту коледжу студента. Прихильники також відзначають зростання кількості заявок меншин до коледжів та університетів частково через політику позитивних дій.<br/>Статистика довела, що коли позитивні дії усуваються, наприклад, коли це було в Берклі-коледжі та UCLA в 1998 році, прийом студентів з меншин впав на 61% і 36% відповідно, довівши, що позитивні дії відіграють важливу роль у процесі прийому студентів з меншин. Прихильники позитивних дій також вважають, що різноманітність у вищій освіті забезпечує кращу освітню атмосферу для всіх студентів, особисто та інтелектуально. Якби позитивні дії були ліквідовані, було б менше студентів меншин, які навчаються в коледжах, що призвело б до того, що різноманіття було б досить незначним. Політика позитивних дій також необхідна для того, щоб компенсувати століття расового, економічного та соціального гноблення. Особи з більш високим соціально-економічним статусом мають більше можливостей, ніж особи з нижчим соціально-економічним походженням. Прихильники вважають, що певні расові або етнічні групи знаходяться в невигідному становищі, тому що вони часто перебувають в сім'ях з низьким рівнем доходу і, отже, не піддаються впливу тих же ресурсів, що і студенти з вищих соціально-економічних класів. Адвокати підтримують поняття конкуренції між студентами на основі заслуг, але стверджують, що позитивні дії компенсують економічні відмінності. Випускники коледжів, які отримали вигоду від позитивних дій, також заявили, що вони отримали кращу роботу, заробили більше грошей і в цілому живуть краще життя через щасливі можливості, які вони отримали через позитивні дії.<br/>Прихильники позитивних дій постійно підкреслюють серйозну важливість позитивних дій, враховуючи їх внесок у покращення як досвіду коледжу, так і суспільства в цілому. Проте противники позитивних дій вважають, що прийшов час покласти край позитивним діям. Противники вважають, що позитивні дії були створені для забезпечення справедливої практики прийому, щоб внести зміни в тривалий період расової дискримінації. Вони вважають, що політика застаріла. "Прийшов час відключити прийняття рішень на основі раси", - говорить Уорд Коннерлі, бізнесмен з Сакраменто, Каліфорнія, і провідний організатор...<br/><br/>Знайдіть ще один тест на передчасність<br/><br/>754 слова - 4 сторінки тягаря, щоб продовжувати процвітати.

Глядачі могли вибрати свій досвід затемнення з доступом до експертних дискусій та телескопічних технологій або веселих заходів, таких як диск-гольф та сімейні ремесла.<br/><br/>Натураліст-в-резиденції USC Руді Манке відвідав глядачів на історичній підкові, щоб поділитися природою сонячного затемнення, що призвело до 2,5 хвилини повного, починаючи з 14:41 вечора.<br/><br/>Після того, як сонце повністю знову з'явилося, в університеті відбувся прийом Eclipse для підйомних випускників середньої школи та майбутніх аспірантів.<br/><br/>У другій половині дня в Школі бізнесу Дарла Мур відбулася безкоштовна публічна промова доктора Крейга Робертса, видатного професора та старшого фізика Аргоннської національної лабораторії, однієї з національних лабораторій Міністерства енергетики США для наукових та інженерних досліджень. У своїй дискусії «Відкладення частинки Бога на відпочинок» доктор Робертс обговорив бозон Хіггса і чому він не може бути використаний для ідентифікації джерела більш ніж 98 відсотків видимої маси Всесвіту.<br/><br/>Великий день, нарешті, підійшов до кінця на стадіоні Вільямс Брайс, де відвідувачі могли насолоджуватися зірками університету. Відкрита практика футбольної команди Gamecock 2017 була ідеальним завершенням феноменального дня.<br/><br/>Підсвічування історії<br/><br/>Відвідувачі кампусу могли спілкуватися разом з експертами затемнення, і всі близькі і далекі були запрошені поділитися цим унікальним досвідом. Дізнайтеся більше про те, як ми вітали цю історичну подію:<br/><br/>Офіційне місце перегляду NASA<br/><br/>Ми були удостоєні честі бути названим НАСА офіційним місцем перегляду. Глядачі на наших 15 станціях перегляду на кампусі мали доступ до експертів, пов'язаних з затемненням, та інших освітніх можливостей, безпечно насолоджуючись сонячним затемненням. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Дні народження<br/><br/>Деякі люди у вашій організації можуть не захотіти давати вам свою дату народження. Infoodle дозволяє видалити рік народження людини! Для цього:<br/><br/>При додаванні людини натисніть кнопку Сховати рік, щоб вилучити рік народження для людини.<br/><br/>Крім того, при редагуванні людини знайдіть поле дати народження для вашого сайту. Натисніть кнопку Редагувати, а потім натисніть кнопку Сховати рік і зберегти.<br/><br/>Так просто!<br/><br/>Примітка: Людина, у якої вилучений рік народження, не з'явиться в будь-яких звітах щодо вікових критеріїв і класифікується як дорослий, оскільки дата їх народження фактично встановлена на 1902 рік! Поле дати народження зазвичай знаходиться в розділі інформації, але може бути переміщено під іншою вкладкою вашим адміністратором. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Комбінації<br/><br/>Комбінації - це захист від удару, хореографічні реакції на різні типи атак. Вони мають багато імен у бойових мистецтвах, але (на моєму досвіді) у кожному мистецтві є їх версія. Це робить їх відмінними від форм, тому що є багато бойових мистецтв, які не мають форм. Що робить вправи партнера такими універсальними? Навіщо практикувати конкретну відповідь, коли (насправді) час, тип атаки, розмір нападника та сотні інших факторів зроблять так, що ви ніколи не будете використовувати всю цю хореографічну відповідь? І, нарешті, як ми можемо тренуватися для реальної оборонної ситуації і в той же час уникнути травм?<br/><br/>Універсальність комбінацій вражає, якщо не сказати більше. Наш стиль карате Кенпо має список 108 комбінацій, які можна вивчити. (Більшість студентів вивчають тільки 20-30) У бразильському джиу-джитсу ви витрачаєте цілі класи, практикуючи арм-бари і удушення, вивчаючи кожну тонкощі руху, в той час як ваш партнер пропонує мало або взагалі не чинить опору. Кожен боксер провів години перед сумкою і / або дзеркалом, кидаючи ту ж комбінацію ударів, поки їх тіло не рухається тільки рефлексом. Комбінації є універсальними, тому що у нас немає кращого способу ввести рух, а потім практикувати тонкі позиції, необхідні для їх роботи. Потрапляння в невелику точку тиску через одяг вимагає багато практики, ловля бару з контролем вимагає ретельно розміщеного стегна і підступної установки, а відмінна комбінація корисна тільки в тому випадку, якщо ви можете пройти її з збалансованого і захищеного положення. Чи можете ви придумати кращий спосіб отримати ці навички?<br/><br/>Існує безліч факторів, які визначають, як ви реагуєте на атаку, і чи в спаринг-матчі або в бою я ніколи не використовував повну комбінацію в своєму захисті. Чому ж тоді ми витрачаємо години на їх практику? Ми практикуємо ці хореографічні відповіді, тому що мета полягає не в тому, щоб витягувати комбінацію 8 кожен раз, коли ви бачите удар гачка, а щоб показати вам один спосіб блокування, а потім можливий спосіб слідувати за ним. Я ніколи не вирішував використовувати комбінацію 3 в реальній ситуації, але блок є одним з моїх ходів. Комбінації додають інструменти в ящик для інструментів, вони не виправляють автомобіль.<br/><br/>Останнє питання - це питання безпеки. Якщо ми практикуємо заради реальності, нам потрібно відтворити реальність. Як ми можемо запобігти травмі при цьому? Коли справа доходить до цього, мова йде про побудову довіри. Ми починаємо повільно і вчимося довіряти тому, що маємо контроль над собою. Ми вчимося довіряти тому, що наші партнери також мають контроль. З часом ми вчимося довіряти нашому контролю над нашим партнером і (трохи страшніше) ми вчимося довіряти контролю нашого партнера над нами. Зрештою (з великою практикою) ви можете рухатися на повній швидкості, кидаючи свого партнера, і бути кинутим, не побоюючись травми.<br/><br/>Комбінації є універсальними з певної причини; вони практикуються, щоб їх можна було розбити на частини, і ми залишаємося в безпеці, починаючи повільно і будуючи довіру. Як і у всьому іншому в бойових мистецтвах, комбінації мають багато причин для своєї практики та виконання. |
