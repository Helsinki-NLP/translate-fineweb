In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Spletna certifikacija CPR Blog<br/><br/>Datum: 23. julij 2014<br/><br/>Avtosomno dominantna intersticijska bolezen ledvic je redka zbirka bolezni, ki prizadenejo znane funkcije ledvic. Preprosto povedano, za stanje je značilno: razvije se bolezen ledvic in se podvrže presaditvi ledvic in drugim boleznim, povezanim s kislo koncentracijo v krvi in protinu. Teoretično se bo stanje pojavilo tudi, če je genetska sprememba podedovana od enega od staršev in se občasno pojavi, ko ni družinske anamneze.<br/><br/>Pogosta imena avtosomno dominantne intersticijske ledvične bolezni<br/><br/>Stanje ima tudi druga imena, in sicer: medularna cistična bolezen ledvic, čeprav se to ime ne uporablja toliko, ker večina ljudi, ki trpijo zaradi tega stanja, nima medularnih cist. Imenuje se tudi juvenilna hiperuricemična nefropatija. Bolezen ponavadi prizadene ljudi, stare od 20 do 50 let. Slednje stanje, kot je omenjeno, se pojavi pri majhnih otrocih, kar pomeni, da ga dobite od obeh staršev.<br/>Cistična bolezen ledvic je podedovano stanje, pri katerem ciste v središču vsake ledvice postopoma izgubijo sposobnost za pravilno delovanje. Ciste se nanašajo na nenormalne mehurje tekočine v ledvicah. Stanje dodatno prestraši ledvice, zaradi česar ne morejo koncentrirati urina in posledično proizvajajo preveč urina. Simptomi vključujejo prekomerno uriniranje, hrepenenje po soli, šibkost, zmedenost, krvavitev, utrujenost, pogoste kolcanje, nizek krvni tlak, slabost in bruhanje, glavobole, bledo kožo, zmanjšan občutek v rokah, hujšanje med mnogimi drugimi. Drugi zapleti vključujejo: anemijo, razjede, izgubo kostne gostote, neplodnost in druge težave, povezane s srcem.<br/>Njegova analiza vključuje krvne preiskave za preverjanje ravni natrija in splošnih funkcij ledvic, teste urina za preverjanje ravni koncentracije in drugih neravnovesij, rentgenske žarke za preverjanje velikosti ledvic, ki se lahko spremenijo zaradi povečane koncentracije urina, ledvično biopsijo in genetsko testiranje za preverjanje morebitnih genetskih sprememb, ki bi se lahko zgodile pravočasno.<br/>Medtem ko bolezen nima rezano in suho zdravljenje, se lahko osredotočite na nadzorne ukrepe, ki vključujejo vnos tekočin in soli za dopolnitev izgubljenega, ko bolezen napreduje v poznejše faze. To pomaga tudi pri zmanjševanju dehidracije. Drugi načini zdravljenja vključujejo jemanje predpisanih zdravil in spremembe prehrane ter minimalni vnos živil, ki vsebujejo fosfor in kalij. Nadaljnji zapleti lahko zahtevajo tudi presaditev ledvice. V bistvu to ni ozdravljiva bolezen, ampak obvladljiva, ko jo odkrijejo v zgodnjih fazah.<br/><br/>Pogost, vendar drugačen dejavnik avtosomno dominantne intersticijske ledvične bolezni<br/><br/>Nefronoftiza in medularna cistična bolezen ledvic sta združena predvsem zato, ker imata v bistvu enake značilnosti, vendar z majhno razliko v dednih vzorcih v primerjavi s prvimi, ki prizadenejo otroke, in slednjimi, ki prizadenejo mlade odrasle in starejše starostne skupine. Podobne značilnosti za oba so koncentracija urina, odpornega na ADH, ki vodi do poliurije in polidipsije, anemije in bolezni ledvic.<br/>Prvi zgoraj omenjeni pogoj je avtosomno recesivno obračunavanje 15% kroničnih bolezni in povzroča ESRD v zgodnjem otroštvu, medtem ko je slednji avtosomno dominanten z nekaj sporadičnimi novimi mutacijami in povzroča ESRD pri ljudeh, starih od 30 do 50 let. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes vs. Lockeov račun o stanju narave<br/><br/>Tema: FilozofijaBesede: 2539Strani: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes in Locke sta med najbolj vplivnimi političnimi filozofi, ki so kdaj pisali v angleščini. Stanje narave, ki je pred organizacijo kompleksnih družb, je skupna predpostavka, ki jo delita Hobbes in Locke, vendar jo razlagata na različne načine. Prvi vidi ljudi v njihovem naravnem stanju kot enako nevarne in svobodne, da si prizadevajo za svoje egoistične cilje, ki jih ne omejujejo obstoječe predstave o pravičnosti, zato je njegovo naravno stanje "vojna vsakega človeka proti vsakemu človeku" (Hobbes 76). Po drugi strani pa slednji vidi ljudi v njihovem prvotnem stanju kot enako dragocene in omejuje naravno svobodo z idejo pravičnosti, ki zahteva, da ne škodujemo drugim, kar omogoča opredelitev stanja narave kot »vzajemne pomoči in ohranjanja« in ne vojne (Locke 15). Ključna razlika med obema filozofoma o naravnem stanju je, da Locke uporablja etične premisleke, medtem ko Hobbes ne, in na koncu vodi Hobbes, da si predstavlja državo, ki izvaja neomejeno moč nad ljudmi, medtem ko Locke omejuje vlado z moralnimi načeli, ki jih šteje za naravni zakon.<br/><br/>Hobbes svoje predpostavke glede stanja narave utemeljuje na dejstvu, da so vsi ljudje približno enaki v svojih fizičnih in duševnih zmožnostih. Priznava, da lahko nekateri posamezniki pokažejo večjo fizično moč ali višji intelekt, vendar vztraja, da "če se vse šteje skupaj, razlika med človekom in človekom ni tako velika" (Hobbes 74). Ker so ljudje približno enakovredni po svojih zmožnostih, imajo tudi podobna upanja, da bodo dosegli svoje cilje in zadovoljili svoje potrebe (Hobbes 75). Kot logičen izid te enakosti, ko ljudje začnejo tekmovati za redke vire, se nihče ne more počutiti popolnoma varnega v svojem posestvu. Tudi če mogočna, zvita in sposobna oseba uspe podrediti »osebe vseh mož«, še vedno ne zagotavlja popolne varnosti (prim. Hobbes 75). Ker noben človek ne more pridobiti takšne superiornosti nad drugimi, ki ga naredi popolnoma imunega na njihovo intelektualno moč, se noben človek ne more počutiti popolnoma varnega, ko je obkrožen s svojimi enakimi. Hobbesova enakost v naravnem stanju je enakost strahu, kjer se vsi ljudje vidijo kot nevarni tekmeci.<br/><br/>Tako kot Hobbes, Locke meni, da so vsa človeška bitja v osnovi enaka, vendar temu izrazu pripisuje zelo drugačen pomen. Z njegovega vidika to ni enakost zmogljivosti, temveč enakost vrednosti. Po njegovem mnenju bi morali ljudje, ki so »promiskuitetno rojeni iz vseh istih prednosti narave«, logično uživati popolno enakost med njimi, saj ni nobenega razloga, da bi koga smatrali za bolj dragocenega po svoji naravi (Locke 8). Edina možna podlaga za to, da se nekateri ljudje imenujejo nad drugimi, bi bila, če bi Bog »s kakršnokoli očitno izjavo svoje volje postavil enega nad drugega« (Locke 8). Ker takšno božansko priznanje superiornosti ni prisotno, Locke sklepa, da se ne sme dvomiti o naravni enakosti vseh predstavnikov človeštva. Hobbes pristopi k enakosti pragmatično in poudarja, da so ljudje v svojem naravnem stanju enako nevarni, vendar Locke uporablja etični pristop in poudarja, da so ljudje enako dragoceni v Božjih očeh. To nesoglasje je le prva razlika med obema avtorjema, ki temelji na dejstvu, da Locke v svojo politično filozofijo vključuje Boga kot predpostavko, medtem ko Hobbes ne.<br/><br/>Druga značilnost Hobbesovega opisa naravnega stanja je njegova razlaga svobode. Po Hobbesovem mnenju stanje narave pomeni neomejeno svobodo, da naredi vse, kar je potrebno za nadaljnji obstoj. Filozof definira svobodo kot "odsotnost zunanjih ovir" pri uporabi lastnih sposobnosti za doseganje svojih ciljev (Hobbes 79). Glavni namen vsakega čutečega bitja je ohraniti njegov nadaljnji obstoj. Posledično je hobbesovska svoboda neomejena priložnost, da storimo vse, kar bi bilo po naši presoji najprimernejše za ohranitev življenja in premoženja (prim. Hobbes 79). Edina omejitev svobode je, da oseba ne more storiti ničesar, kar bi bilo v nasprotju z vzdrževanjem njenega življenja ali uničenjem »sredstev za njegovo ohranitev« (Hobbes 79). Poleg tega ni meja in vsakdo ima »pravico do vsega, tudi do telesa drugega«, če to prispeva k njegovemu preživetju. Tako je naravna svoboda, kot jo vidi Hobbes, odsotnost zunanjih ovir pri uresničevanju svoje pravice do vsega, da bi vzdrževali in zagotavljali svoj nadaljnji obstoj.<br/><br/>Locke prav tako podpira idejo naravne svobode, vendar, ne preseneča, pristopi k njej na način, ki se bistveno razlikuje od Hobbesove. Takoj, ko začne razpravljati o svobodi v naravnem stanju, takoj ugotavlja, da stanje svobode ne pomeni "države licence" (Locke 9). Filozof opredeljuje dve posebni omejitvi človekove svobode v naravnem stanju. Prva je identična tisti, ki jo je uvedel Hobbes: ne glede na to, kako svobodna in neodvisna je oseba, »ni svobodna, da bi se uničila« (Locke 9), vendar pa druga omejitev neposredno nasprotuje Hobbesovim predpostavkam. Po Lockeu ima vsako človeško bitje naravno dolžnost, da »ne škoduje drugemu v svojem življenju, zdravju, svobodi ali lastnini«. Tako kot pri svoji razlagi enakosti, avtor utemeljuje to trditev na etičnih in verskih temeljih: ljudje morajo ohraniti obstoj drug drugega, saj so vsi stvaritve istega »vsemogočnega in neskončno modrega stvarnika« (Locke 9). Tako je Lockeova svoboda v naravnem stanju veliko strožja od Hobbesove z uvedbo obveznosti, da se vzdrži škodovanja sebi in drugim.<br/><br/>Razlike med obema avtorjema se kažejo tudi v njunih poročilih o pravičnosti v naravnem stanju človeštva. Kar se tiče Hobbesa, je razmejitev pravičnih in nepravičnih praks zgolj stvar zakona. V naravnem stanju ni sodne prakse in edini zakon, ki ureja človeška bitja v njihovem prvotnem stanju, je naravni zakon, ki jih zavezuje le k iskanju osebne varnosti. Posledica tega je, da nič ne more biti nepravično v prvotnem stanju človeštva: »pojmi prave in napačne pravičnosti in nepravičnosti« nimajo mesta in pomena v odsotnosti strogo uveljavljenega zakona (prim. Hobbes 78). Dokler ljudje uporabljajo svojo skoraj neomejeno svobodo, da neusmiljeno tekmujejo med seboj za vire, do katerih so enako upravičeni, nimajo meril za razlikovanje med pravičnimi in nepravičnimi dejanji. Zato hobbesovsko stanje narave nasprotuje sami ideji pravičnosti, saj jo avtor razlaga zgolj kot funkcijo formaliziranega in uveljavljenega prava.<br/><br/>Locke pripisuje pravičnosti drugačen pomen in nanjo gleda ne toliko v zakonodajnem kot v etičnem smislu. Ta članek je že omenil, da Locke, za razliko od Hobbesa, uporablja etične pojme in na splošno svojo politično filozofijo utemeljuje na moralnih in ne zgolj praktičnih predpostavkah. Lockejev naravni zakon, za razliko od Hobbesovega, zavezuje človeška bitja, da skrbijo drug za drugega, namesto da bi preprosto pustili vsakogar, da se poskrbi zase. Posledično je v njegovem naravnem stanju prostor za pravičnost in krivičnost. Avtor sam opozarja na to dejstvo, ko opozarja, da nihče ne sme drugemu odvzeti sredstev za ohranitev njegovega življenja, "razen če gre za to, da se stori pravica do storilca" (Locke 9). Ta izjava razkriva z največjo jasnostjo, da po Lockeu obstaja pravičnost v stanju narave, poleg tega pa jo morajo ljudje dejavno ohranjati. Kriterij pravičnosti, ki ga Hobbesovo naravno stanje nima, je druga omejitev naravne svobode, ki jo je naložil Locke: dejanje je nepravično, če predstavlja neupravičeno grožnjo življenju in lastnini druge osebe.<br/><br/>Te razlike v obravnavanju enakosti, svobode in pravice ali krivice obeh avtorjev kulminirajo v njihovi interpretaciji odnosa med stanjem narave in stanjem vojne. Z Hobbesovega stališča sta sinonimi, saj je neusmiljena konkurenca edini logični rezultat postavljanja ljudi z enakimi sposobnostmi in podobnimi potrebami v okolje z omejenimi viri. Ta povezava je izrecno izražena: »Če si dva človeka želita iste stvari, ki ju kljub temu oba ne moreta uživati, postaneta sovražnika« in sta zato med seboj v vojni (Hobbes 75). Ker pa so ljudje številni in vsi imajo podobne sposobnosti in potrebe, se ta konkurenca ne manifestira le v posameznih interakcijah, ampak tudi na ravni človeštva kot celote. Dokler imajo vsi ljudje enake in neomejene pravice do vseh virov ter celo do teles in življenj drug drugega, je stanje narave vojna »vsakega človeka proti vsakemu človeku« (Hobbes 76). Ta mračna razlaga izhaja neposredno iz Hobbesovega prikaza naravnega stanja, ki ga urejajo izključno egoistični nagoni posameznikov.<br/><br/>Po drugi strani pa Locke razlikuje med stanjem narave in stanjem vojne in opozarja, da čeprav se lahko pojavijo hkrati, ni razloga, da bi se ena z drugo poistovetili. Lockeova definicija vojnega stanja je skoraj identična tisti, ki jo je ponudil Hobbes. Po Lockeu, "kdor poskuša dobiti drugega človeka v svojo absolutno moč, se s tem postavi v stanje vojne z njim" (14). Ta razlaga se popolnoma ujema s hobbesovskim prepričanjem, da univerzalna pravica vseh do vsega, vključno s telesi in življenji drugih ljudi, vodi v vojno stanje. Vendar pa Locke zavrača izenačevanje vojnega stanja in stanja narave ravno zato, ker zanika Hobbesovo razlago naravne svobode. Ker Lockeovo naravno stanje omejuje ljudi, da bi škodovali drug drugemu z drugo omejitvijo svobode, je poskus na svobodo druge osebe kršitev naravnega zakona. Medtem ko je za Hobbesa vojna privzeto stanje človeštva, jo Locke prikazuje kot izkrivljanje stanja narave in ne njene vladavine.<br/><br/>Te razlike v opisovanju države o naravi in njenih sestavnih delih, kot so svoboda, enakost, pravičnost in vojna, utirajo pot avtorjem, ki nasprotujejo prikazom vlade. Na podlagi svoje pesimistične ocene stanja narave avtor Leviathan sklepa, da v pogojih vojne ne more biti nobenega določenega upanja za "življenje časa, ki ga narava običajno dopušča ljudem" (Hobbes 80). Rešitev je postaviti univerzalno pravico do vsega in vsakomur pustiti »toliko svobode proti drugim ljudem, kolikor bi dovolil drugim ljudem proti sebi« (Hobbes 80). Udeleženci nastale družbene pogodbe vlagajo neomejene svoboščine, ki so se jim predali, v suverena – nosilca vrhovne oblasti, katerega namen je ohraniti doseženi status quo s kaznovanjem vseh prestopkov proti njemu. Suverena oblast je absolutna: vladar ima oblast, da »stori vse, kar se mu zdi potrebno«, da bi spodbujal mir med svojimi podložniki, tako da nihče ne bi napadal življenja ali lastnine drugega. Hobbes sklepa, da brez takšne neoporečne osebe, ki ima pravico storiti karkoli z podložniki, ne more biti miru in nobenega jamstva za varnost.<br/><br/>Medtem ko se Locke strinja s potrebo po ustvarjanju politično organiziranih družb, pa kljub temu nasprotuje Hobbesovi ideji o suvereni moči kot neomejeni in neoporečni. Kot je bilo že omenjeno, Lockeovo stanje narave ni niti približno tako grozno kot tisto, ki jo je naslikal Hobbes, zaradi obveznosti ljudi, da ohranijo ne le sebe, ampak tudi drug drugega. Zato potreba po socialni pogodbi ne izhaja iz strahu pred drugimi, temveč iz čistega udobja. Majhne skupnosti morda ne potrebujejo številnih zakonov za reševanje konfliktov in »uradnikov za nadzor procesa«, vendar večja združenja menijo, da je priporočljivo ustanoviti vlade v ta namen (Locke 57). Vendar pa moč vlade ne more biti neomejena, ker bi povzročila, da bi bili podložni "nestalni, negotovi, neznani, samovoljni volji drugega človeka" (Locke 17). Takšna vlada bi pomenila dvojno kršitev naravnega prava. S strinjanjem z absolutno močjo druge osebe nad svojim življenjem bi subjekt kršil svojo prvo omejitev, ki prepoveduje, da bi se poškodoval. Kar se tiče vladarja, bi uničenje svobode druge osebe pomenilo neposredno škodo in bi bilo zato v nasprotju z drugo omejitvijo.<br/><br/>Kot neposredno nadaljevanje njegovega primera za neomejeno vladno oblast, Hobbes zanika delitev oblasti kot načelo. Po njegovem mnenju ima suveren, ko je enkrat ustanovljen, »vso moč predpisovanja pravil«, ki urejajo življenje podanikov ali, na kratko, zakonodajno oblast (prim. Hobbes 114). Suveren si pridržuje tudi pravico »zaslišati in odločati o vseh sporih« – to je sodno oblast (prim. Hobbes 114). Nazadnje, ker je celoten namen suverena prisiliti podanike, da se vzdržijo škodovanja drug drugemu, ni dvoma, da je izvršilna oblast tudi njegova izključna pravica. Ločitev oblasti kot koncept je Hobbesovi tuja zaradi njegovih pogledov na stanje narave. Ustvarjanje politične entitete, v kateri bi se izvršilna, zakonodajna in sodna veja med seboj nadzorovala – to je tekmovala – bi pomenilo ponovno vzpostavitev Hobbesovega stanja narave kot vojne na višji ravni. Ker ljudje sklenejo družbeno pogodbo in ustanovijo vlado, da bi za seboj postavili stanje narave, ga ne bi ponovno vzpostavili v drugačni obliki, je Hobbesova ločitev oblasti neposredno protislovna.<br/><br/>Po drugi strani pa Locke sprejema ločitev oblasti kot temeljno načelo svoje politične teorije. Njegov razlog za ločitev je očiten v razpravi o mejah zakonodajne oblasti. Kot pravi Locke, bi bilo komaj priporočljivo, »da bi imele iste osebe, ki imajo moč, da sprejemajo zakone, tudi v svojih rokah moč, da jih izvršujejo«. Filozof opozarja na nepopolnost človeške narave in neločljivo željo, da bi se »ujeli v moči« kot razlog za ta previdnostni ukrep (Locke 76). Tako kot v Hobbesovem primeru tudi Lockeova razlaga delitve moči izhaja neposredno iz njegove interpretacije naravnega stanja. Če že obstaja pravičnost v naravi in jo ljudje lahko razumejo, je vsaka vlada neizogibno podvržena istemu naravnemu zakonu. Ker absolutna oblast nad ljudmi krši obe omejitvi tega zakona, je priporočljivo, da jo ločimo in razdelimo, da bi vlada ustrezno delovala.<br/><br/>Ta članek je pokazal, da medtem ko so razlike med Hobbesovimi in Lockeovimi poročili o naravnem stanju človeštva številne, na koncu predstavljajo prisotnost odsotnosti moralnih predpostavk. Hobbes vidi naravno stanje kot stanje neomejene svobode, kjer ljudje, ki so obdarjeni z enakimi sposobnostmi in niso vezani na nobene moralne pojme, kot je pravica, nenehno tekmujejo za vire. Locke razlaga enakost in svobodo bolj etično kot praktično in meni, da je vojna izkrivljanje naravnega stanja, saj naravni zakon zavezuje ljudi, da ne škodujejo drug drugemu. Hobbes vztraja na vsemogočnem vladarju, saj v odsotnosti etičnih omejitev nobena druga avtoriteta ne bi mogla prisiliti ljudi, da ne škodujejo drug drugemu. Vendar pa bi bilo po Lockejevem mnenju podelitev neomejenih pooblastil vladi v nasprotju z etičnimi omejitvami, ki so vgrajene v zakon narave, zato se zavzema za ločitev oblasti, za razliko od Hobbesa. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Modna policija: Katera igra prestolov je bruhala<br/><br/>Kanadsko-francoski pevec Abbas Hasan dal slepo prizadevanje, da zasenči vse človeštvo na Fashion Parade 2014. Nič narobe s tem, razen varnosti je prednostna naloga in glasbenik je nevarnost za zdravje tukaj.<br/><br/>Želi biti zvezda. Na žalost ni dobil obvestila, v katerem so obupanim in zloglasnim povedali, da je zvezda metafora. Ni vam treba izgledati kot zvezda in dobesedno zažgati naš vid. Prav tako je združenje All Pakistan Aunty Association uradno vložilo pritožbo zoper njega. Lokalni trg je izsušil ponarejene kristale in pošasti. Nimajo ničesar, kar bi nosili za svoje dvotedenske visoke čaje in trdijo, da je kriv. Očitno je obleka navdihnjena z Igro prestolov. Ali se lahko, prosim, drži komponiranja žalostnih pesmi o mrtvem psu svojega soseda, namesto da bi konceptualiziral obleke? Ali pa je to travma izgube psa, katerega smrt očitno ni končana, saj še vedno nosi truplo.<br/><br/>Polnilni list Outfit<br/><br/>Nihče ne more odločiti, kje se začne obleka in kje se Abbas konča. Vi strmite v očaranosti, potopite se v globoko brezno in se sprašujete, zakaj nosi usnjene hlače. Čigav konj je ubil, da bi ukradel sedlo, prekrito čez ramena? Je bil v zaporu tik pred pojavom rdeče preproge in je pozabil sneti verige? Kako bo preživel sintetično usnje in izpuščaj po sequinu, ki mora biti smrtonosen v tako visokem odmerku? Zakaj sem še vedno živ?<br/><br/>Ideja<br/><br/>Njegov navdih je bil navidezno Igra prestolov, vendar je na koncu izgledal, kot da je bil vržen iz vikingske restavracije. Če bi naletel na katerega od likov iz predstave, bi bil ubit v prvih petih sekundah prve epizode.<br/><br/>Duševno zdravje ali pomanjkanje: Nekdo ga pripelje k svetovalcu ASAP! Zdi se, da je pod predpostavko, da nosi mrtvega psa pomeni, da je edini prijatelj, ki ga je imel v svojem življenju, še vedno živ. Dragi Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Zanikanje ni reka v Egiptu<br/><br/>2. Vaša mučena psiha ne pomaga vaši glasbi, zato poiščite pomoč<br/><br/>3. Poskusite namišljene prijatelje<br/><br/>Izvlecite ga!<br/><br/>Vsi na sedežu modne policije smo hudo travmatizirani. Abbas je nekdo, ki nam ni bil všeč, ko smo ga aretirali. Trenutno je v priporu in se poskuša maščevati tako, da se obleče iz drugih fantazijskih predstav. Samo bleščice se je lepil, da bi izgledal kot Edward Cullen iz Twilight. Kot sporočilo javne službe in da bi preprečili nadaljnje živčne zlome, smo mu dali naslednje primere moških z rdeče preproge istega dogodka.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Ko ste v dvomih, igrajte varno. Pevec izgleda kot vaš povprečni stric v shaadi. Navadna črna obleka brez dodatkov, tudi če je malo nesorazmerna, je izvedljiva. Zohaibov videz je zmešan v vse in nič, in ko nimate modnega občutka ali denarja za najem stilista, je to v redu. Ne nosi tveganja za srčni zastoj za sodelavce na dogodku. Glede na Abbasovo občutljivo duševno stanje, bi si moral prizadevati za ta pogled, vedno in za vedno.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Nekega dne, po desetletjih terapije, si Abbas lahko prizadeva, da bi nosil obleko, kot je obleka Alija Zafarja. Ali je bil zelo blizu, da bi izgledal kot mojster D v francoski restavraciji s svojo belo poletno jakno s črnimi reverji, vendar ga srajca shrani, ne glede na saten. Njegove hlače bi bile smešne, če ne bi bile zložene na gležnjih. Čevlji so tisto, kar hipster chic happy ends so narejeni iz. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Določanje hidravličnih lastnosti tal z različnimi vlažnimi tekočinami : Diplomsko delo, predloženo v delnem izpolnjevanju zahtev za magisterij znanosti na Univerzi Lincoln<br/><br/>Povzetek<br/><br/>Hidravlične lastnosti tal, kot so hidravlična prevodnost, zadrževanje vode in razmerja rastlinske vode, prevladujejo v procesih gibanja vode. Na primer, infiltracija, izhlapevanje in pretok vode v tleh. Kot razširjen pojav v tleh, odpornost tal na vodo spreminja hidravlične funkcije tal tako, da se upira toku vode v tla. Poleg tega hidravlične lastnosti niso odvisne samo od pore sistema tal, ampak tudi vplivajo na fizikalno-kemijske lastnosti pore površin. V primerjavi z vodo, etanol ne vpliva na vodoodbojnost zaradi svoje nižje površinske napetosti. Namen uporabe etanola je odpraviti učinek odpornosti tal na hidravlične lastnosti. Vendar pa lahko uporaba čistega etanola v naravnih tleh razgradi organske snovi v tleh in povzroči spremembe fizikalnih lastnosti. Zato so lahko vodne raztopine etanola alternativna možnost, vendar pa izvedljivost uporabe vodnega etanola za določanje krivulje zadrževanja tekočine v tleh ostaja neznana. Namen te študije je preveriti izvedljivost vodnih raztopin etanola (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % in 100 % v/v) za določitev krivulje zadrževanja tekočine pod majhnim razponom tlaka, ki se uporablja v vzorcih grobega peska z različno vlažilnostjo in organsko spremenjenimi naravnimi tlemi (Templeton mult ilo (TSL)) s stopnjo komposta, biopreg, komuna in mle. Rezultati so pokazali, da je bila desorpcija preskusnih vodnih raztopin etanola v primerjavi z vodo za približno 1 do 3-krat hitrejša na podlagi vsebnosti tekočine pri enakem tlaku in času za doseganje vsakega ravnovesja. Rezultati peščenega poskusa so pokazali, da so bile pri koncentraciji vodne raztopine etanola pod 50 % izgube zaradi izhlapevanja manjše od 1 %, relativne razlike med preskusno tekočino in vodo pa manjše od 10 %. Vendar so bile izgube zaradi izhlapevanja 11,06 % in 24,6 %, relativne razlike pa so bile približno 15 % in 30 % v 50 % oziroma 100 % raztopini etanola. Nasprotno pa organske spremembe v blatu Templeton ne samo povečajo sposobnost zadrževanja vode, ampak tudi zmanjšajo izgube izhlapevanja. Izgube izhlapevanja v TSL tleh in TSL tleh z organskimi spremembami so bile 1 % v raztopinah z manj kot 50 % vsebnostjo etanola. Izgube izhlapevanja 50 % in 100 % etanola so bile 2,8 % oziroma 2,9 %. Relativne razlike med vodo in preskusno tekočino so bile podobne peščenemu poskusu, ko so bile preskusne koncentracije tekočine pod 50 %. Vendar so bile relativne razlike v 50-odstotni in 100-odstotni raztopini etanola manjše kot v vzorcu peska s približno 10 % oziroma 15 %. Poleg tega je analiza relativne razlike pokazala, da imajo skoraj vse vodne raztopine etanola pri enakem dobavljenem tlaku nižjo volumetrično vsebnost tekočine v primerjavi z vodo, kar je odsev vodnih raztopin etanola, ki se absorbirajo hitreje kot voda pod enakim tlakom. Zato bi se 10 % do 40 % raztopin etanola lahko štelo za alternativo za določanje hidravličnih lastnosti tal zaradi njihove hitrejše stopnje desorpcije in brez vpliva odpornosti tal na vodo. Zaradi izhlapevanja in raztapljanja organskega materiala vodne raztopine etanola nad 50% koncentracije niso bile primerne za grob pesek ali srednje teksturirano zemljo.... [Pokaži celoten povzetek] |
