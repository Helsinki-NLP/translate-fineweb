So an abundant and essential source of energy that would be used in space for the space colony would be solar radiation by developing satellite solar power stations. To live in space, humans must be protected from the fierce intensity and penetrating wavelengths of unattenuated sunlight, but this same energy is one of the primary resources of space. The colony will have to have enough energy to maintain a fairly uniform temperature even though it is apace. The sun shines twenty-four hours a day and is not dimmed by an atmosphere. Shaded materials not exposed to direct sunlight will almost be at absolute zero. While the temperature in closed bodies exposed to the sun can soar above the boiling point. The colony will need to have both heaters and air conditioners. On the other hand, this sun's energy can be converted into electricity in the colonies. It will be converted with ten percent efficiency to electrical power which is sold at a rate of .012 kw/hr, a square kilometre of space would return more than $14,000,000 each year. Converting solar power to electricity in space, we would build satellite solar power stations that would intercept the sunlight and convert it into electricity. The satellite solar power stations would intercept enough sunlight to replace five nuclear reactors or coal plants. The stations could be as big as nine miles long and four miles wide and it would only weigh twenty thousand tons. It would be built with hollow triangular girders made of aluminum that is very fast and easy to build . Solar power satellites are a pollution free way to generate electricity and cost no more than coal or nuclear energy. There has been twomajor designed stations made so far.

Torej bi bil obilen in bistven vir energije, ki bi se uporabljal v vesolju za vesoljsko kolonijo, sončno sevanje z razvojem satelitskih sončnih elektrarn. Da bi živeli v vesolju, je treba ljudi zaščititi pred močno intenzivnostjo in prodornimi valovnimi dolžinami nezadostne sončne svetlobe, vendar je ta ista energija eden od primarnih virov vesolja. Kolonija bo morala imeti dovolj energije, da bo ohranila dokaj enakomerno temperaturo, čeprav je hitro. Sonce sije štiriindvajset ur na dan in ni zatemnjeno z atmosfero. Zasenčeni materiali, ki niso izpostavljeni neposredni sončni svetlobi, bodo skoraj na absolutni ničli. Temperatura v zaprtih telesih, izpostavljenih soncu, se lahko dvigne nad vrelišče. Kolonija bo morala imeti tako grelnike kot klimatske naprave. Po drugi strani pa se lahko ta sončna energija pretvori v elektriko v kolonijah. Pretvoril se bo z desetodstotno učinkovitostjo v električno energijo, ki se prodaja po stopnji 0,012 kw / h, kvadratni kilometer prostora pa bi vsako leto vrnil več kot 14.000.000 $. S pretvorbo sončne energije v elektriko v vesolju bi zgradili satelitske sončne elektrarne, ki bi prestregle sončno svetlobo in jo pretvorile v elektriko. Satelitske sončne elektrarne bi prestregle dovolj sončne svetlobe, da bi nadomestile pet jedrskih reaktorjev ali elektrarn na premog. Postaje bi lahko bile dolge devet milj in široke štiri milje in bi tehtale le dvajset tisoč ton. Zgrajen bi bil z votlimi trikotnimi nosilci iz aluminija, ki je zelo hiter in enostaven za izgradnjo . Sončna energija sateliti so onesnaževanje brez način za proizvodnjo električne energije in ne stanejo več kot premog ali jedrska energija. Doslej sta bili izdelani dve glavni zasnovani postaji.

| With the role of the media being crucial<br/><br/>With the role of the media being crucial in the promotion of development the Tonga also sought to curtail the media blackout by establishing a community radio station. In 2007 they established the Tonga on air. It was meant to cater for the Tonga who had not been receiving coverage from the state media. The establishment of the radio station was a move aimed at providing the Tonga with access to information and giving Tonga arts and culture exposure. Mudimba points out to the significance of the radio station basing on the fact that the Tonga did not have any radio or television signal for years and that the establishment of Tonga on air would give the BaTonga community the chance to be informed as well as the chance to reach out to the general populace.<br/>The establishment of the radio at Sinazongwe was aided by a team of Austrian radio activists was primarily aimed at improving communication and access to information in the marginalised remote area. The station was at Sinanzongwe Basic School and had the capacity to cover a radius of 20 kilometres reaching out to approximately 10000 people and was meant to serve the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi<br/>For a marginalised community like the Tonga a community radio station can be used as a means for articulation and self-representation which not only helps in strengthening self-consciousness , identity , and culture but it is also an apparatus of communication which contributes to the emancipation and autonomy of a people in a region dominated by political crisis and gives impulse to a vivid public discourse on culture , society and politics. In that way a community radio station will is broad promoter of public discourse.. it facilitates for equal medial participation as it is open to more democratic and self-organised as it is open to the community. The Tonga on air project has also facilitated for the re-joining of families which were once separated by the construction of the Kariba dam. A community radio station also influences change in media policy as it forwards. The radio station also helped in bridging the information gap. It also offers educational programmes in Tonga thus it is very audible to the targeted community<br/>Establishment of a Community Museum<br/>Also as a way of promoting and developing Tonga language and culture the BaTonga also established a community museum at Binga centre. The museum has played a significant role in revitalising Tonga language and culture. BaTonga Museum (2012) the museum known as BaTonga Museum was established in 2000 with the help as a concerted effort between the Tonga community and MS Zimbabwe a Danish non-governmental organisatiion.as highlighted above in community ladened with stereotypes and misconceptions which have led to the near extinction of Tonga language and culture the museum serves as a platform to rewrite the history of the Tonga through the various programmes it carries out. BaTonga Museum (2002) the main objective of the museum is to demystify Tonga culture and create awareness about the Tonga locally, nationally and internationally.it also seeks to rebuild self-esteem and dignity amongst the Tonga. Furthermore besides promoting and preserving Tonga language and cultural material the museum also works in support of the livelihoods of Tonga artists by buying artefacts for display in the gallery. Since ones culture is also conveyed through arts the museum has played a very significant role in this respect. The museum also hosts a number of cultural events which are e With the above objectives in mind the establishment of BaTonga Museum by the Tonga community can be deemed a good developmental initiative as it helps to promote the recognition of the Tonga people. According to Chikozho the curator of the museum the museum has made a major contribution towards the restoration of the Tonga social fabric. He attributes his assertion to the role the museum has played in Binga district and in Zimbabwe at large. The museum has acted as a source of information to both the Tonga and the general populace. By taking responsibility of buying Tonga cultural material the museum has both supported Tonga livelihoods and the promotion and preservation of Tonga culture. Previously Tonga artefacts were being sold on the informal market and exported out of the country at low costs and were sold at very huge prices and in some instances they would be given alien names which meant that the Tonga were being exploited. Such a scenario did not do the Tonga good thus the museum's role in protecting Tonga cultural material is a way of promoting development amongst the Tonga through promoting their culture. The museum is also a resource centre as everyone whom wishes to learn about Tonga culture is referred to it in as far as Tonga history and culture is concerned.<br/><br/>The Introduction ICT amongst The Tonga<br/>The Tonga through the help of donors has also made efforts to promote access to modern technology by introducing ICT to the Tonga community. They launched the Tonga Online project in 2001. The establishment of the project was facilitated by the Kunzwana Trust which worked with the Austrian Zimbabwean friendship association. Since its launch the Tonga online project has primarily focused on promoting a Tonga voice over the internet. The projects objectives are to provide the Tonga access to the worlds most advanced communication tools which will enable them to represent themselves to the outside world and reflect upon the social, political and economic environment of both the global village in which the Tonga live.<br/>The project derives its name mulonga from the Zambezi River. The name reflects the history and aspirations of the Tonga people. The name constantly revokes memories of how the Tonga were displaced to make way for the construction of the Kariba dam which has seen them becoming a marginalised group in Zimbabwe. Even well after their relocation the Tonga are being passed by huge commercial benefits from tourism and electricity that are being extracted from their former habitat which was transformed into a vast expanse of water known as the Kariba dam . The Tonga Online project seeks to establish and expand communication technology with and amongst the Tonga on both sides of the Zambezi by joining them in with information communication technology. A number of school based information technology centres have been established in Binga district have been established in Binga district namely at Binga High School and at Manjolo and these have catered for the larger Tonga community with more schools being earmarked for the project<br/>Access to information has become a great question of political rights hence the importance of the Tonga Online project as a tool to spearhead awareness continuity empowerment and local development amongst the Tonga people. The educational significance of the Tonga online project is very significant especially for those in a remote part of the country like Binga where there are no institutions of higher learning<br/>The project also reflects the digital divide and other uneven developments; in the global village. These gaps and imbalances are not only a question of access to resources but also to have the capacity to use these modern day communication tools. In a world where access to information has become a universal human right the Tonga online project tends to support higher levels of human development<br/>The use of the global village has created a platform of for the Tonga to promote their culture through the internet. Currently the internet is one of the most convenient modes of communication and the Tonga Online project is a platform that can be used to give the Tonga a voice on the internet. It has been used as a platform by the Tonga to interact with other cultures hence it has been a medium of cultural exchange thus promoting the recognition of the Tonga<br/><br/>We Will Write a Custom Essay Specifically For You For Only $13.90/page! | Vloga medijev je ključnega pomena<br/><br/>Ker je bila vloga medijev ključnega pomena pri spodbujanju razvoja, je Tonga skušala tudi zmanjšati medijsko zatemnitev z ustanovitvijo radijske postaje v skupnosti. Leta 2007 so ustanovili Tongo v zraku. Ustanovitev radijske postaje je bila poteza, namenjena zagotavljanju Tongi dostop do informacij in dajanje Tonga umetnosti in kulturne izpostavljenosti. Mudimba opozarja na pomen radijske postaje, ki temelji na dejstvu, da Tonga že leta ni imela radijskega ali televizijskega signala in da bi vzpostavitev Tonge na zraku dala skupnosti BaTonga priložnost, da je obveščena, pa tudi priložnost, da doseže splošno prebivalstvo.<br/>Ustanovitev radia v Sinazongweju je podprla ekipa avstrijskih radijskih aktivistov, katere glavni cilj je bil izboljšanje komunikacije in dostopa do informacij na marginaliziranih oddaljenih območjih. Postaja je bila v osnovni šoli Sinanzongwe in je imela zmogljivost pokrivati polmer 20 kilometrov, ki sega do približno 10.000 ljudi in je bil namenjen za služenje Tonga na obeh straneh Zambezi.<br/>Za marginalizirano skupnost, kot je Tonga, se lahko radijska postaja Skupnosti uporablja kot sredstvo za artikulacijo in samoreprezentacijo, ki ne pomaga le pri krepitvi samozavesti, identitete in kulture, temveč je tudi komunikacijski aparat, ki prispeva k emancipaciji in avtonomiji ljudi v regiji, v kateri prevladuje politična kriza, in daje spodbudo živahnemu javnemu diskurzu o kulturi, družbi in politiki. Na ta način je radijska postaja v skupnosti širok promotor javnega diskurza.. omogoča enakopravno medijsko udeležbo, saj je odprta za bolj demokratično in samoorganizirano, saj je odprta za skupnost. Projekt Tonga o zraku je prav tako olajšal ponovno združitev družin, ki so bile nekoč ločene z gradnjo jezu Kariba. Skupnostna radijska postaja vpliva tudi na spremembo medijske politike, ko gre naprej. Radijska postaja je pomagala tudi pri premostitvi informacijske vrzeli. Ponuja tudi izobraževalne programe v Tongi, zato je zelo slišno za ciljno skupnost<br/>Ustanovitev skupnostnega muzeja<br/>Kot način promocije in razvoja tonga jezika in kulture je BaTonga ustanovila tudi skupnostni muzej v centru Binga. Muzej je igral pomembno vlogo pri oživitvi tonga jezika in kulture. Muzej BaTonga (2012) muzej, znan kot muzej BaTonga, je bil ustanovljen leta 2000 s pomočjo usklajenega prizadevanja med skupnostjo Tonge in MS Zimbabve, dansko nevladno organizacijo. Muzej BaTonga (2002) Glavni cilj muzeja je demistifikirati kulturo Tonge in ustvariti ozaveščenost o Tongi na lokalni, nacionalni in mednarodni ravni. Poleg spodbujanja in ohranjanja tonga jezika in kulturnega gradiva muzej deluje tudi v podporo preživljanju tonga umetnikov z nakupom artefaktov za razstavo v galeriji. Ker se kultura prenaša tudi skozi umetnost, je muzej pri tem odigral zelo pomembno vlogo. Muzej gosti tudi številne kulturne prireditve, ki so e Z zgoraj navedenimi cilji v mislih ustanovitev muzeja BaTonga s strani skupnosti Tonga se lahko šteje za dobro razvojno pobudo, saj pomaga spodbujati priznanje ljudstva Tonga. Po besedah Chikozhoja, kustosa muzeja, je muzej pomembno prispeval k obnovi socialnega tkiva Tonge. Svojo trditev pripisuje vlogi, ki jo je muzej igral v okrožju Binga in v Zimbabveju na splošno. Muzej je deloval kot vir informacij tako za Tonga in splošno prebivalstvo. Z prevzemom odgovornosti za nakup kulturnega gradiva Tonga je muzej tako podprl preživetje Tonga ter promocijo in ohranjanje kulture Tonga. Prej so se artefakti Tonge prodajali na neformalnem trgu in izvažali iz države po nizkih stroških in so se prodajali po zelo visokih cenah, v nekaterih primerih pa bi jim dali tuja imena, kar bi pomenilo, da se Tonga izkorišča. Tak scenarij ni dobro Tonga zato je vloga muzeja pri zaščiti kulturnega gradiva Tonga je način za spodbujanje razvoja med Tonga s spodbujanjem njihove kulture. Muzej je tudi vir center, kot vsakdo, ki želi izvedeti o kulturi Tonga se nanaša na to, kar zadeva zgodovino in kulturo Tonga.<br/><br/>Uvedba IKT med Tongo<br/>Tonga s pomočjo donatorjev si je prizadevala tudi za spodbujanje dostopa do sodobne tehnologije z uvedbo IKT za tongaško skupnost. Projekt Tonga Online so začeli leta 2001. Ustanovitev projekta je omogočil sklad Kunzwana, ki je sodeloval z avstrijskim združenjem prijateljstva v Zimbabveju. Od začetka spletnega projekta Tonga se je osredotočil predvsem na promocijo glasu Tonge prek interneta. Cilji projektov so zagotoviti Tongi dostop do najnaprednejših komunikacijskih orodij na svetu, ki jim bodo omogočili, da se zastopajo v zunanjem svetu in razmišljajo o socialnem, političnem in gospodarskem okolju tako globalne vasi, v kateri živijo Tonga.<br/>Projekt izhaja iz imena mulonga iz reke Zambezi. Ime odraža zgodovino in težnje ljudstva Tonga. Ime nenehno preklicuje spomine na to, kako so bili Tonga razseljeni, da bi naredili prostor za gradnjo jezu Kariba, ki je videl, da so postali marginalizirana skupina v Zimbabveju. Tudi po njihovi selitvi Tonga prehaja skozi ogromne komercialne koristi od turizma in električne energije, ki se pridobivajo iz njihovega nekdanjega habitata, ki se je spremenil v ogromno vodno površino, znano kot jez Kariba. Projekt Tonga Online si prizadeva vzpostaviti in razširiti komunikacijsko tehnologijo s Tongo in med njo na obeh straneh Zambezija, tako da se jim pridruži z informacijsko komunikacijsko tehnologijo. Številni centri za informacijsko tehnologijo, ki temeljijo na šolah, so bili ustanovljeni v okrožju Binga, in sicer v srednji šoli Binga in v Manjolu, in ti so poskrbeli za večjo skupnost Tonga z več šolami, namenjenimi za projekt<br/>Dostop do informacij je postalo veliko vprašanje političnih pravic, zato je pomen projekta Tonga Online kot orodje za vodenje ozaveščenosti kontinuiteto opolnomočenje in lokalni razvoj med prebivalci Tonga. Izobraževalni pomen spletnega projekta Tonga je zelo pomemben, še posebej za tiste, ki živijo v oddaljenem delu države, kot je Binga, kjer ni visokošolskih ustanov.<br/>Projekt odraža tudi digitalno vrzel in druga neenakomerna gibanja v globalni vasi. Te vrzeli in neravnovesja niso le vprašanje dostopa do virov, temveč tudi zmožnost uporabe teh sodobnih komunikacijskih orodij. V svetu, kjer je dostop do informacij postal univerzalna človekova pravica, se spletni projekt Tonga nagiba k podpori višjih stopenj človekovega razvoja.<br/>Uporaba globalne vasi je ustvarila platformo za Tonga za promocijo svoje kulture prek interneta. Trenutno je internet eden izmed najbolj priročnih načinov komunikacije in Tonga Online projekt je platforma, ki se lahko uporabijo, da Tonga glas na internetu. Tonga ga je uporabljala kot platformo za interakcijo z drugimi kulturami, zato je bil medij kulturne izmenjave in tako spodbujal priznanje Tonge.<br/><br/>Napisali bomo esej po meri posebej za vas za samo $ 13.90 / stran! |

| Computer Networks – ARP<br/><br/>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure for mapping a dynamic Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a Media Access Control or MAC address.<br/><br/>The job of the ARP is essentially to translate 32-bit addresses to 48-bit addresses and vice-versa. This is necessary because in IP Version 4 (IPv4), the most common level of Internet Protocol (IP) in use today, an IP address is 32-bits long, but MAC addresses are 48-bits long.<br/><br/>ARP works between network layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). The MAC address exists on layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer, while the IP address exists on layer 3, the network layer.<br/><br/>ARP can also be used for IP over other LAN technologies, such as token ring, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and IP over ATM.<br/><br/>In IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses, ARP has been replaced by the Neighbor Discovery protocol.<br/><br/>How ARP works<br/><br/>When a new computer joins a LAN, it is assigned a unique IP address to use for identification and communication. When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular LAN arrives at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a MAC address that matches the IP address. A table called the ARP cache maintains a record of each IP address and its corresponding MAC address.<br/><br/>All operating systems in an IPv4 Ethernet network keep an ARP cache. Every time a host requests a MAC address in order to send a packet to another host in the LAN, it checks its ARP cache to see if the IP to MAC address translation already exists. If it does, then a new ARP request is unnecessary. If the translation does not already exist, then the request for network addresses is sent and ARP is performed.<br/><br/>ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines know they are using that particular IP address. When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.<br/><br/>Host machines that don't know their own IP address can use the Reverse ARP (RARP) protocol for discovery.<br/><br/>An ARP cache size is limited and is periodically cleansed of all entries to free up space; in fact, addresses tend to stay in the cache for only a few minutes. Frequent updates allow other devices in the network to see when a physical host changes their requested IP address. In the cleaning process, unused entries are deleted as well as any unsuccessful attempts to communicate with computers that are not currently powered on.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing and ARP cache poisoning<br/><br/>Any LAN that uses ARP must be wary of ARP spoofing, also referred to as ARP poison routing or ARP cache poisoning. ARP spoofing is a device attack in which a hacker broadcasts false ARP messages over a LAN in order to link an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server within the network. Once a link has been established, the target computer can send frames meant for the original destination to the hacker's computer first as well as any data meant for the legitimate IP address.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing can have serious impacts on enterprises. When used in their simplest form, ARP spoofing attacks can steal sensitive information. However, the attacks can also go beyond this and facilitate other malicious attacks, including: | Računalniška omrežja – ARP<br/><br/>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) je postopek za preslikavo dinamičnega naslova internetnega protokola (IP naslov) na stalni fizični naslov stroja v lokalnem omrežju (LAN). Naslov fizičnega računalnika je znan tudi kot nadzor dostopa do medijev ali MAC naslov.<br/><br/>Naloga ARP je v bistvu prevajanje 32-bitnih naslovov na 48-bitne naslove in obratno. To je potrebno, ker je v različici IP 4 (IPv4), najpogostejša stopnja internetnega protokola (IP), ki se danes uporablja, naslov IP dolg 32 bitov, vendar so naslovi MAC dolgi 48 bitov.<br/><br/>ARP deluje med omrežnimi plastmi 2 in 3 modela medsebojne povezave odprtih sistemov (model OSI). Naslov MAC obstaja na plasti 2 modela OSI, plast podatkovne povezave, medtem ko IP naslov obstaja na plasti 3, omrežni plasti.<br/><br/>ARP se lahko uporablja tudi za IP nad drugimi LAN tehnologijami, kot so žetonski obroč, podatkovni vmesnik s porazdeljenimi vlakni (FDDI) in IP preko bankomata.<br/><br/>V protokolu IPv6, ki uporablja 128-bitne naslove, je bil ARP nadomeščen s protokolom Neighbor Discovery.<br/><br/>Kako deluje ARP<br/><br/>Ko se nov računalnik pridruži omrežju LAN, mu je dodeljen edinstven naslov IP, ki ga uporablja za identifikacijo in komunikacijo. Ko dohodni paket, namenjen gostiteljskemu računalniku v določenem LAN, prispe na prehod, prehod zahteva od programa ARP, da poišče naslov MAC, ki se ujema z naslovom IP. Tabela, imenovana predpomnilnik ARP, hrani zapis vsakega naslova IP in njegovega ustreznega naslova MAC.<br/><br/>Vsi operacijski sistemi v omrežju IPv4 Ethernet hranijo predpomnilnik ARP. Vsakič, ko gostitelj zahteva naslov MAC, da pošlje paket drugemu gostitelju v LAN, preveri predpomnilnik ARP, da preveri, ali že obstaja prevod naslova IP v MAC. Če se to zgodi, potem nova zahteva ARP ni potrebna. Če prevod še ne obstaja, se pošlje zahteva za omrežne naslove in se izvede ARP.<br/><br/>ARP oddaja paket zahtev vsem strojem v LAN-u in sprašuje, ali kateri od strojev ve, da uporablja ta določen IP naslov. Ko stroj prepozna naslov IP kot svoj, pošlje odgovor, tako da lahko ARP posodobi predpomnilnik za prihodnjo referenco in nadaljuje s komunikacijo.<br/><br/>Gostiteljski računalniki, ki ne poznajo svojega naslova IP, lahko za odkrivanje uporabijo protokol Reverse ARP (RARP).<br/><br/>Velikost predpomnilnika ARP je omejena in se občasno očisti vseh vnosov, da se sprosti prostor; pravzaprav naslovi ponavadi ostanejo v predpomnilniku le nekaj minut. Pogoste posodobitve omogočajo drugim napravam v omrežju, da vidijo, kdaj fizični gostitelj spremeni svoj zahtevani naslov IP. V postopku čiščenja se izbrišejo neuporabljeni vnosi in neuspešni poskusi komuniciranja z računalniki, ki trenutno niso vklopljeni.<br/><br/>Zastrupitev z ARP predpomnilnikom<br/><br/>Vsaka LAN, ki uporablja ARP, mora biti previdna pred ARP spoofingom, imenovanim tudi ARP strupeno usmerjanje ali zastrupitev predpomnilnika ARP. ARP spoofing je napad na napravo, v katerem heker oddaja lažna sporočila ARP preko omrežja LAN, da bi povezal naslov MAC napadalca z naslovom IP legitimnega računalnika ali strežnika v omrežju. Ko je povezava vzpostavljena, lahko ciljni računalnik najprej pošlje okvirje, namenjene prvotnemu cilju, na računalnik hekerja, kot tudi vse podatke, namenjene legitimnemu IP-naslovu.<br/><br/>ARP spoofing ima lahko resne posledice za podjetja. Če se uporablja v najpreprostejši obliki, lahko ARP spoofing napadi ukradejo občutljive informacije. Vendar pa lahko napadi presegajo to in olajšajo druge zlonamerne napade, vključno z: |
