| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Zgodovinska soseska Leclaire, nekoč imenovana Edwardsville's "predmestje na jugu", je bila ustanovljena kot zadružna skupnost leta 1890 in je ostala ločena vas, dokler ni bila priključena mestu Edwardsville leta 1934. Časopisi in revije v Združenih državah Amerike in Evropi poročajo o Leclairovem poskusu, zlasti v prvih 20 letih njegovega obstoja. Leta 1979 je bila zaradi svoje edinstvene zgodovine nekdanja vas vpisana v nacionalni register zgodovinskih krajev.<br/><br/>Leclaire je ustanovil Nelson Oliver Nelson, proizvajalec vodovodnih instalacij v St. Louisu, ki je že vrsto let poskušal izboljšati položaj delavskega razreda. Nelson je želel izboljšati delovne pogoje za svoje zaposlene in zagotoviti stanovanja v bližini tovarn, tako da bi delavci in njihove družine lahko enostavno sodelovali v rekreativnih in izobraževalnih programih, ki jih podjetje ponuja brezplačno. Pred letom 1890, ko je bil še vedno v St. Louisu, so proizvodna in distribucijska podjetja N. O. Nelson Company začela zagotavljati delitev dobička skupaj z izobraževalnimi in rekreativnimi priložnostmi. Leclairov zadružni eksperiment bi prinesel dodatne koristi.<br/><br/>Ko so Nelsonovi zaposleni navedli, da se želijo preseliti na podeželje, so se predstavniki podjetja obrnili na voditelje majhnih mest v več skupnostih v Missouriju in Illinoisu v bližini njihovega sedeža v St. Iskali so primerno nepremičnino za gradnjo novih tovarn in vzorčne vasi. Južno od Edwardsvillea so našli 125-akrno zemljišče z dostopom do vode, premoga in prevoza. Lokalni poslovneži so hitro ukrepali, da bi ponudili finančno spodbudo. V manj kot treh tednih je skupnost zbrala sklad v višini 20.000 $ iz posameznih prispevkov med 1 in 1000 $, da bi Nelson izbral Edwardsville za svoje podjetje.<br/><br/>Mestni voditelji so upali, da bodo našli nepremičnine znotraj mestnih meja Edwardsvillea, toda ko ni bilo mogoče najti primernega mesta, so bili prepričani, da bo naložba Nelson južno od mesta kmalu postala del Edwardsvillea. Čeprav je Nelson izpolnil vse pogoje za gradnjo in ustvarjanje delovnih mest v svoji pogodbi, bi bilo 44 let pred priključitvijo Edwardsvilleu. Leclaire, omejen z Madison / Brown Avenues na vzhodu, železniške proge na zahodu, Hadley / McKinley Avenues na jugu in Wolf Street na severu, je ostala neodvisna vas od 1890 do 1934. V tem času si je pridobil ugled za inovacije v poslovnem, izobraževalnem in stanovanjskem načrtovanju.<br/><br/>Vas Leclaire na zemljevidu Edwardsville iz leta 1931<br/>Z vljudnostjo Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsonova odločitev za izgradnjo vasi ni bila narejena iz hira. Do poznih 1880-ih je bil mednarodni vodja na področju sodelovanja in delitve dobička, izmenjal je družbene teorije z drugimi po vsem svetu, hkrati pa širil svoje poslovanje v St. Svojo eksperimentalno vasico je poimenoval po pariški deliteljici dobička Edme Jean Leclaire, vendar je obiskal številne druge družbene vizionarje, ki so zagotavljali informacije in navdih. Z zbiranjem najboljših idej iz teh primerov je Nelson ustanovil Leclaireja, da bi po njegovih besedah »dal delo, spodbujal inteligenco, zagotavljal rekreacijo, negoval lepoto in gradil domove«. To so bili vsi dejavniki, ki jih je določil, da so potrebni za moške, da vodijo izpolnjeno življenje. Kasnejši pisatelji so te besede uporabili za oblikovanje Leclairovih temeljnih načel: delo, domovi, izobraževanje, rekreacija in lepota, vendar z dodatnim pomembnim načelom svobode.<br/><br/>Delo<br/><br/>Delo bi lahko šteli za najpomembnejši od teh dejavnikov, saj brez tovarniških delovnih mest v Leclaireju ne bi bilo vasi. Stavbe tovarne opeke je zasnoval arhitekt E. A. Cameron, da bi zagotovile naravno svetlobo, prezračevanje poleti in ogrevana tla pozimi. Vzpostavljen je bil sistem za gašenje požarov in čeprav industrijske nesreče niso bile odpravljene, so bila vložena vsa prizadevanja za zagotovitev varnosti delavcev. Pokrite z bršljanom opečne stavbe so obkrožale dobro urejene trate in cvetlični vrtovi, ki so kompleksu dajali videz kampusa. Leta 1894 je New York World novinarka Nellie Bly imenovala stavbe "idealna popolnost stavb za človeka, da bi delal v".<br/><br/>Proizvodni kompleks N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company v Leclaireju<br/>Prijatelji Leclaire<br/><br/>Politike podjetja Nelson so bile zasnovane za zaščito finančne stabilnosti zaposlenih. Delavci bi lahko zaslužili delež dobička in imeli glas v podjetju, če bi se odločili za to možnost. Načrt delitve dobička je zaposlenim Nelson dal ponos lastništva, kar je privedlo do podporne delovne sile. V preteklih letih je bilo nekaj kratkotrajnih stavk delavcev, vendar so bile težave z delom večinoma redke. Delavci so imeli tudi primeren delovni čas in konkurenčne plače.Obstajal je skrbniški sklad, ki je zagotavljal pokojnine in bolniški dopust, pa tudi vdovske pokojnine, če delavec umre, ne glede na to, ali je smrt povezana z njegovo zaposlitvijo ali ne.<br/><br/>Sedež podjetja za N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) je ostal v St. Louisu, vendar se je celotno N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company preselilo v Leclaire. Proizvodno podjetje je bilo razdeljeno na trgovine, ki so izdelovale različne izdelke. Leta 1900 so trgovine postale neodvisne družbe za davčne namene, vendar so bile vse še vedno v lasti N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Trgovine so vključevale Kabinet Mill, kjer so izdelovali lesne izdelke od omare do mlina. Usposobljeni obrtniki, ki so delali tukaj, so izpolnili tudi posebne pogodbe, vključno z blagajniškimi kletkami za lokalno banko in oltarjem, ki se še vedno uporablja v škofovski cerkvi svetega Andreja v Edwardsvillu. Marble Shop je bil specializiran za arhitekturni marmor, ki so ga izrezale in namestile Nelsonove posadke v domovih, podjetjih in celo državnih prestolnicah po vsem srednjem zahodu. Strojna delavnica, ki je postala Bignall in Keeler, je izdelala stroje za cevno montažo, črpalke, merilnike in različna mehanska orodja, ki se pričakujejo v vodovodni trgovini. Sredi 1890-ih so se razvejali tudi za izdelavo specializiranih predmetov, kot je kolo Leclaire. Trgovina z medenino je vključevala livarno, kjer so izdelovali različne vodovodne cevi in orodja. Ti primeri predstavljajo le nekaj dela, opravljenega v tovarnah Leclaire. Logotip podjetja je bil stiliziran "NONCO", ki ga je še danes mogoče videti na vodovodnih napeljavah in nekaterih požarnih hidrantih v Edwardsvillu.<br/><br/>Domovi<br/><br/>Preden je bilo mogoče zgraditi hiše, je bilo potrebno stanovanje za delavce, ki so dokončali tovarniške stavbe, kot tudi gradnjo domov. Da bi zadovoljili te potrebe, je podjetje zgradilo "Klubsko hišo", veliko stavbo, ki je služila številnim namenom. Poleg namestitve je bila to prva izobraževalna stavba v skupnosti in je vsebovala dobro opremljeno knjižnico.<br/><br/>Gradnja stanovanjskega dela Leclaireja se je začela takoj po ustanovitvi vasi junija 1890. Julius Pitzman, inovativni krajinski arhitekt, ki je postavil prve parcele v Leclairu, jih je ustanovil s številnimi zaščitnimi zavezami. Zaveze so predvidevale široke, ukrivljene ulice, velike lote in omejitev, ki je omejila nepremičnine samo na stanovanjske ali izobraževalne namene. Podjetje je tlakovalo ulice, zagotavljalo električne ulične luči, vgradilo pločnike in posadilo na stotine dreves vzdolž ulic Leclaire. Kasnejši deli Leclaireja so bili postavljeni s konvencionalno zasnovo mreže in manjšimi serijami, vendar so še vedno vključevali omejitve.<br/><br/>Viktorijanska koča Leclaire leta 1907<br/>Izvirnik: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Sprva so bile hiše zgrajene s strani podjetja in nato prodane po skorajšnjih stroških zaposlenim Nelson, da bi spodbudili lastništvo doma. Če je delavec zbolel in ni mogel narediti svoje hipoteke, so bila plačila začasno ustavljena, dokler se ni vrnil na delo. Hiše so bile ponujene v različnih oblikah hiš in podjetje je oglaševalo, da nista bila dva stanovanja podobna. Najstarejše hiše so bile predvsem viktorijanske koče, ki so prihajale z elektriko in tekočo vodo. Prebivalci so lahko kupili hišo, zgrajeno v podjetju, ali kupili prazno parcelo in sami zgradili hišo, če je arhitekturna zasnova ustrezala standardom podjetja.<br/><br/>V kasnejših letih so bile parcele prodane vlagateljem, ponavadi prebivalcem Edwardsvillea, številne domove pa so v 1920-ih zgradili lokalni izvajalci, ki so jih nato prodali prebivalcem območja.<br/><br/>Izobraževanje<br/><br/>Nelson je verjel v izobraževanje za vse, vključno z delavskim razredom. Izobraževalno programiranje se je začelo z vrtcem v Klubski hiši leta 1892 in se nadaljevalo v novi izobraževalni stavbi na Holyoake Road 722. Ta stavba, ki se običajno imenuje "Šolska hiša", je zagotavljala veliko dvorano za sestanke in programe, vendar je imela premične predelne stene, ki so jo čez dan razdelile v učilnico. V večernih urah so potekali plesi, sestanki ali programi Leclaire Self-Culture Club, ki so vključevali tedenska predavanja profesorjev Univerze Washington ali narodno znanih govornikov, ki so bili, kot N. O. Nelson, del gibanja za družbeno izboljšanje na prelomu stoletja. Med njimi so bili Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Zlato pravilo" Jones in avtorica Charlotte Perkins Gilman, med drugim.<br/><br/>Otroci vpisani v vrtec Leclaire leta 1913<br/>Izvirnik: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>V desetih letih po izgradnji izobraževalne stavbe leta 1895 je potekala vrsta izobraževalnih poskusov, vključno z industrijsko šolo, fakulteto, nočno šolo in akademijo. Najzgodnejši in najdaljši življenjski cilj je bil jutranji vrtec, ustanovljen leta 1892, ki je uporabljal Fröbelov model. Ta dvoletni program je bil brezplačen za vse, vključno z otroki Edwardsville, vse do leta 1931, ko je podjetje iz finančnih razlogov začelo zaračunavati šolnino študentom, ki niso bili otroci zaposlenih. Nelson Manufacturing je upravljal vrtec do leta 1934, ko je bila stavba predana šolskemu okrožju Edwardsville za nominalno pristojbino.<br/><br/>Rekreacija<br/><br/>Čolni na jezeru Leclaire leta 1915<br/>Izvirnik: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreacija je bila pomembna značilnost Leclaire. Podjetje je zagotovilo športne objekte za baseball, tenis in pozneje nogomet. Zgrajena je bila bowling in biljard dvorana, pozimi pa je bilo jezero za čolnarjenje, plavanje, ribolov ali drsanje. Park Leclaire je bil opremljen s čolnarskimi hišami, moškimi in ženskimi kopališči ter velikim paviljonom. Prebivalci so organizirali plese, seno, črkovanje čebel in druge dejavnosti, družba pa je sponzorirala skupino, ki je redno igrala na zabavah v vasi ali v Edwardsvilleu. Tako kot izobraževalne funkcije v klubski hiši in šolski hiši, so bili rekreacijski objekti v Leclaireju odprti za vse in so bili pogosto destinacija za obiskovalce Edwardsvillea in celo St.<br/><br/>Lepota<br/><br/>Zgodnja fotografija jezera Leclaire<br/>Izvirnik: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Zadnji dejavnik, ki ga je Nelson imel za pomembnega za zadovoljujoče življenje, se je nanašal na okolje. Cenil je lepoto in čistočo, ki jo je mogoče najti na podeželju, in spodbudil vse v Leclaireu, da bi polepšali svojo lastnino s sajenjem vrtov in sadovnjakov. Nelson sam je vodil z zgledom, tako da je podjetje rastlinjak zagotovil brezplačne rože in tekmovanja so potekala za najlepše dvorišča. Leclaire je bil postavljen tako, da je celotna vas imela park, kot je nastavitev še danes očitna.<br/><br/>Svoboda<br/><br/>Trgovina Leclaire Cooperative<br/>Izvirnik: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson je navedel pet temeljnih načel za Leclaire, sodobni pisatelji pa dodajo še šesto: Svoboda. Vsi programi, ki jih ponuja podjetje, so bili na voljo tako zaposlenim kot lokalnim prebivalcem, vendar noben ni bil obvezen. Svoboda izbire, ali bodo sodelovali v programih podjetja, je bila v celoti odvisna od posameznika. Prebivalci Leclaireja so lahko delali za Nelson Manufacturing ali drugje, delavci pa niso bili dolžni živeti v Leclaireju. Sodelovanje v rekreativnih in izobraževalnih programih je bilo tudi neobvezno. Obstajala je tudi poslovna trgovina, kjer so zaposleni lahko nakupovali, vendar za razliko od drugih mest v podjetju nihče ni bil zadolžen do podjetja. Trgovina Leclaire je bila zadruga, kjer so članom zaračunavali poštene tržne cene, nato pa so jim četrtletno izplačevali dividende.<br/><br/>Družbeno mesto drugačno<br/><br/>Vse te ugodnosti so Leclaire naredile edinstvenega v drugih mestih podjetja, vendar so bili tudi posamezni primeri, ko je podjetje pokazalo sočutje in skrb za zaposlene. Podjetje je zaprlo tovarne in najemalo izletniške vlake, da so delavce in njihove družine odpeljali v St. Louis za en dan na svetovnem sejmu v St. Ko je bil denar tesen, je Nelson občasno dal dodaten denar v vsako plačno ovojnico, da bi delavcem olajšal življenje, in če je uvedel program, s katerim se moški niso strinjali, so ga izgovarjali in, kolikor pogosto ne, Nelson se je obrnil.<br/><br/>Rojen v Lillesandu na Norveškem leta 1841, je bil N. O. Nelson zapleten človek. Bil je kapitalist, ki je verjel v svobodno podjetništvo, pa tudi socialist, privrženec "zlatega pravila" in domoljub, ki je služil Uniji v državljanski vojni. Do leta 1900 je bil multimilijonar, toda do svoje smrti leta 1922 je vse to dal za izboljšanje delavskega razreda.<br/><br/>Čeprav Leclaire ni bil edini Nelsonov družbeni eksperiment, velja za njegov najuspešnejši poskus. Druga velika prizadevanja za socialno izboljšanje so vključevala verigo zadružnih trgovin v New Orleansu, vrtec za otroke črnih zaposlenih v njegovem Bessemerju v Alabami, tovarne in dom za potrošniške izdelke v Indiu v Kaliforniji.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire je bil mednarodno znan kot vreden in uspešen eksperiment. Opisala ga je v New York Worldu večkrat, še posebej pa novinarka Nellie Bly leta 1894, ki je obširno pisala o vzornem mestu, kjer je "vprašanje dela rešeno in vsi srečni v majhni vasi blizu St. Los Angeles Times je redno poročal tudi o N. O. Nelsonu, kakor tudi Chicago Daily Tribune in številne druge publikacije.<br/><br/>Leta 1915 je Nelson v govoru na Leclairovem praznovanju 15. obletnice dejal: "Leclaire vam širi široko odprto gostoljubje in vam danes ponuja lahkotnost in udobje ter lepoto in navdih, ki jih uživamo vsak dan." Od tega dne je minilo več kot stoletje, vendar vabilo še vedno stoji. Prebivalci in raziskovalci so vabljeni, da se seznanijo z zgodovino Leclaireja in razmislijo o lekcijah, ki bi se jih lahko naučili za izboljšanje prihodnjih generacij.<br/><br/>Ena od nekdanjih stavb proizvodnega kompleksa v letu 2019, ki zdaj služi kot kampus N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Avtor Obiski prek Zoom ali Skype<br/><br/>Veselim se obiska s svojimi učenci preko Zoom ali Skype! Skype je odlična možnost za šole / razrede, ki ne prinašajo osebno avtorjev, ampak ki želijo raziskati knjige in poezijo, se povezati z avtorjem in postavljati vprašanja ena na ena.<br/><br/>Stroški<br/><br/>Ponujam 30-45-minutne Zoom ali Skype obiske s šolami za 125 dolarjev na sejo (ali 200 dolarjev za dve seji, ki potekata v treh urah zjutraj ali popoldne; 325 dolarjev za tri seje v enem dnevu; 425 dolarjev za štiri seje v enem dnevu). V vsaki seji poskušam otroke čim bolj aktivno vključiti. Ne, to ni enaka vrsta povezave, kot jo ponuja osebni obisk, vendar je še vedno lahko navdihujoča in motivirajoča za otroke!<br/><br/>Kaj počnem<br/><br/>Vsaka seja za do 50 študentov vključuje:<br/><br/>5 minut tehničnih nastavitev<br/><br/>3 segmenti po 10 minut vsak — Izbirate lahko med:<br/><br/>Kako sem postal pisatelj<br/><br/>Pisanje te knjige (ti izbereš, na katero knjigo se bom osredotočil)<br/><br/>Branje (nekatere pesmi berem in otroci mi pomagajo prebrati druge)<br/><br/>Predstavitev v razredu (vaši učenci so mi dali branje ali predstavo - zelo hvaležno občinstvo!)<br/><br/>Pisanje pesmi skupaj<br/><br/>Vprašanja in odgovori<br/><br/>5 minut sproščanja/pozdravljanja<br/><br/>Prav tako klepetam z razredi pred-službenih učiteljev ali skupinami učiteljev v službi o poeziji in pisanju.<br/><br/>Nasveti za odličen virtualni obisk<br/><br/>Nasveti za uspešen virtualni obisk<br/><br/>Eden od mojih ciljev za virtualne šolske obiske je ujeti interaktivnost, ki naredi obiske v osebi uspešne in zabavne. Toda resnica je, da je včasih težko biti virtualno interaktiven! Čas se morda ne sinhronizira pravilno, zaradi česar je branje skupaj izziv, in res mi je težko slišati posamezne študente, razen če pridejo in govorijo neposredno v mikrofon / računalnik. Toda po nekaj poskusih in napakah sem odkril nekaj načinov za najboljše možne virtualne obiske. Tukaj so: 10 načinov, kako narediti moj obisk s svojimi učenci veliko izkušnjo!<br/><br/>Pred obiskom<br/><br/>Naj bodo otroci čim bolj navdušeni nad obiskom. Obiščite mojo spletno stran z njimi. Preberite nekaj mojih knjig z njimi. Zberite nekaj vprašanj, ki jih imajo študenti zame. Vse, kar naredite pred časom, da se počutite kot velik posel, bo šlo daleč do sodelovanja študentov.<br/><br/>Postavite video kamero ali prenosni računalnik s spletno kamero, tako da lahko vidim čim več občinstva. Težko je oceniti udeležbo študentov, ko vidim le nekaj študentov.<br/><br/>Omejite vsako skupino na 50 študentov. Neverjetno težko je vključiti velike skupine prek videoposnetka.<br/><br/>Hitro se bom premaknil od teme do teme ali pesmi do pesmi. Spomnite študente, da bodo morali pozorno poslušati, da bi razumeli, kaj se dogaja.<br/><br/>Občasno naredim malo Reader's Theater s študenti. Če vam pošljem skriptirane študentske dele pred časom, natisnite kopijo za vsako sejo in po potrebi razrežite na kose.<br/><br/>Med obiskom<br/><br/>Ko razpravljam o knjigi, če imate to natisnjeno knjigo, prosim, držite jo za študente, da jo vidijo.<br/><br/>Ti si moj zastopnik. Pogosto ne morem poklicati študentov in slišati posameznih odgovorov. Zato bi lahko rekel: "Dobili bomo 3 ideje. Dvigni roko, če imaš idejo." Nato prevzamete, pokličete tri študente in sporočite te odgovore vsem v sobi in meni.<br/><br/>Izberite samozavestne, odhajajoče študente za skriptirane študentske dele (če jih pošljem vnaprej). Med svojimi obiski v šoli poskušam pritegniti nekaj manj samozavestnih učencev, vendar sem ugotovil, da to ne deluje tako dobro med virtualnimi obiski, ker jih ne morem slišati.<br/><br/>Naj učenci z govornimi deli sedijo spredaj, ko je čas, naj vstanejo in jih opomnijo, naj govorijo glasno.<br/><br/>Pri virtualnih obiskih je upravljanje vedenja izključno na vas. Pogosto ne morem natančno videti, kaj se dogaja, zato vas prosimo, da se vključite, kot je potrebno. Če pride do velike motnje, me samo prosite, da se za trenutek držim, da ne bom klepetal, medtem ko nihče ne bo pozoren:>)<br/><br/>Svobodno me fotografirajte na zaslonu in delite na socialnih medijih - čeprav so moje slike pogosto smešne, ker med branjem ustvarjam smešne obraze ali kaj podobnega!<br/><br/>Če imate kakršna koli vprašanja, prosimo, vprašajte, bodisi pred ali med obiskom!<br/><br/>Načrtovanje virtualne seje<br/><br/>Vas zanima načrtovanje virtualnega obiska z mano? Samo pošljite mi e-pošto, da določite datum, in bomo šli od tam |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arhiv novic<br/><br/>Nova knjiga raziskuje načine za spopadanje z izzivi HIV<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis z Marjorie Human, ki je oblikovala naslovnico knjige, Delovanje na HIV.<br/><br/>Pandemija HIV je pri ljudeh prinesla najboljše in najslabše v smislu odziva, po eni strani je spodbudila stigmo in nasilje, po drugi strani pa je prinesla konstruktivne in podporne odzive različnih posameznikov in skupin. Dennis Francis, dekan Pedagoške fakultete Univerze Svobodne države, raziskuje, kako se drama lahko uporabi za spodbujanje vitalnih družbenih sprememb, pa tudi individualnih vedenjskih sprememb.<br/><br/>Delovanje na področju HIV-a ponuja sistematično raziskovanje drame kot pristopa k razpravi o HIV/AIDS-u in z njim povezanih stališčih in vedenju. Knjiga je znanstveno besedilo in vključuje delo približno dvajsetih izjemno ustvarjalnih avtorjev. Avtorji knjige so med drugim prof. Hazel Barnes (Univerza Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Univerza Stellenbosch) in Yvonne Sliep iz Univerze KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Ta projekt se je začel leta 2009 in mi je vzel veliko časa, da sem združil delo izjemno ustvarjalnih avtorjev. Raziskava, ki jo sporočamo v knjigi, je izvirna in pravočasna ter pomembno prispeva k pogovorom o vlogi in pomenu drame pri reševanju vprašanj HIV-a in aidsa," pravi prof. Francis. |
| Transcript of Testing the Effect of Ghost Traps on the Blue Crab, Callinectis Sapidus , in Barnegat Bay<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16 September 2008<br/><br/>I chose to use the Blue crab, Callinectus sapidus, for my experiment because it is abundant here in Barnegat Bay and it is relatively easy to catch.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus is a swimming crab Important to commercial soft-shell crabbers, both commercial and recreational (Jivoff 2008)Main method of crabbing is basic crab trap<br/><br/>Ghost traps occur when a trap is lost yet continues to catch organisms (Breen 1990)John Wnek says there are easily 2,000 in Barnegat BaySince C. sapidus is so aggressive (Pollock 1998) , what happens when they get stuck in cage with no food and what impact does this have?<br/><br/>If caught in a ghost trap, C. sapidus will have cannibalistic tendencies until the last one has died off from starvation.<br/><br/>How do we duplicate a ghost trap in the lab?Create ghost trap by closing of entrances with wire mesh and zip tiesOnce specimen are loaded, close off top with zip ties<br/><br/>Crab entrance closed off with wire mesh<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeCameraZip Ties<br/><br/>How do we get crabs?Trap some a few days early and starve themOnce ready to begin, collect new crabs from trapsAdd directly to ghost trap with 2 from starved tank<br/><br/>Six crabs total, one missingFound small space to escape due; patched up with zip tieTwo crabs deadOne just has claws leftOther missing both paddles and one claw<br/><br/>Four crabs alive and intactLarger dead crab has no changeSmaller dead crab has only section of carapice left<br/><br/>Last day of experimentTook two samplesNo change from second day in first sampleSecond observation, larger carapice separated from rest of body/claw<br/><br/>Based on the results, I reject my null hypothesis that the crabs will simply be in the trap. The results show that they cannibalized two crabs in the trap, then, at least for the duration of my test, were satiated.<br/><br/>Ghost traps do affect the organisms stuck in them, namely C. sapidus.C. sapidus has no problem resorting to cannibalism when no other food source is available.Cannot extrapolate my data over whole bay. | Prepis preizkušanja učinka pasti duhov na modro rako, Callinectis Sapidus , v zalivu Barnegat<br/><br/>Michael FranklinMarine Field Methods16. september 2008<br/><br/>Za svoj poskus sem se odločil uporabiti modro rakovice, Callinectus sapidus, ker je tukaj v zalivu Barnegat v izobilju in ga je relativno enostavno ujeti.<br/><br/>Callinectes sapidus je plavanje rakovice Pomembno za komercialne rakovice z mehko lupino, tako komercialne kot rekreativne (Jivoff 2008)Glavna metoda rakovice je osnovna past za rakovice<br/><br/>Duh pasti se pojavijo, ko je past izgubljena, vendar še vedno ujame organizme (Breen 1990)John Wnek pravi, da je v Barnegat Bayu zlahka 2.000 Ker je C. sapidus tako agresiven (Pollock 1998) , kaj se zgodi, ko obtičijo v kletki brez hrane in kakšen vpliv ima to?<br/><br/>Če se ujame v duhovno past, bo C. sapidus imel kanibalistične težnje, dokler zadnji ne umre od lakote.<br/><br/>Kako podvojiti past duha v laboratoriju?Ustvarite past duha z zapiranjem vhodov z žično mrežo in zadrgoKo se vzorci naložijo, zaprite vrh z zadrgo<br/><br/>Rakov vhod zaprt z žično mrežo<br/><br/>Crab TrapWire MeshWire CuttersRopeKameraZip vezi<br/><br/>Kako dobimo rakovice?Past nekaj dni zgodaj in jih stradajoKo ste pripravljeni začeti, zbrati nove rakovice iz pastiDodaj neposredno v past duha z 2 iz lačen tank<br/><br/>Šest rakov skupaj, ena manjkaNašli smo majhen prostor, da bi pobegnili; zakrpali z zadrgoDve raki mrtviEden je šele ostal krempljeDrugi manjkajo obe vesla in en kremplj<br/><br/>Štirje rakovi živi in nedotaknjeniVečji mrtev rak nima spremembeManjši mrtev rak ima le del karapike.<br/><br/>Zadnji dan poskusaVzel dva vzorcaBrez sprememb od drugega dne v prvem vzorcuDrugo opazovanje, večji karapike ločen od preostalega telesa/kremplja<br/><br/>Na podlagi rezultatov zavračam svojo ničelno hipotezo, da bodo raki preprosto v pasti. Rezultati kažejo, da so v pasti kanibalizirali dve raki, nato pa so bili vsaj za čas mojega testa nasičeni.<br/><br/>Duhovne pasti vplivajo na organizme, ki so obtičali v njih, in sicer C. sapidus.C. sapidus nima težav z zatekanjem k kanibalizmu, ko ni na voljo nobenega drugega vira hrane. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Odkar se je Lara Croft prvič pojavila v igri Tomb Raider (1996), so njeni podvigi kot pustolovski in hitri raziskovalec odmevali z igralci, kar ji je prineslo mesto v panteonu velikih likov pop kulture. Iz tega razloga bomo svet Lare Croft postavili v Storyworld Spotlight od 22. decembra 2021 do 6. marca 2022.<br/><br/>Oblikovanje Croft<br/><br/>Laro Croft je leta 1996 ustvaril studio Core Design v Derbyju (Združeno kraljestvo). Studio je iskal glavni lik za prihajajočo 3D pustolovščino za PlayStation 1. Igra v perspektivi tretje osebe, kjer bi igralci videli glavnega lika v celoti skozi vsako sceno.<br/><br/>Ker je bila igra o "razbijanju skrivnostnih grobnic globoko pod piramidami", bi moral glavni lik videti pustolovski in imeti možgane, da preživijo zapletene misije. Po nekaj razmisleku se je rodila Lara Croft, mlada, višji razred in popolnoma britanska ženska, ki je bila tako skrivnostna in inteligentna, kot je bila trmasta in samozavestna.<br/><br/>Uspeh in polemika<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) je bil separativni uspeh za Core Design, ki se je hitro podvojil pri gradnji Tomb Raider 2 (1997) in 3 (1998). Velik del uspeha je bil pripisan vodilni dami iger, ki je našla občudovalce tako pri moških kot pri ženskah.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Nepremičnine Beseda dneva: Možnost<br/><br/>Opcija: sporazum, da se za določeno obdobje ohrani odprta ponudba za prodajo ali najem nepremičnin. Možnost se lahko uporabi, na primer, da se kupcu omogoči čas za reševanje vprašanj financiranja, naslova, območja in izvedljivosti, preden se kupec zaveže k nakupu. Možnosti se pogosto uporabljajo v procesu sestavljanja zemljišča. Opcijo je treba podpreti z dejanskim upoštevanjem, ločeno in neodvisno od nakupne cene nepremičnine. Sama uvodna izjava ni zadostna, razen v primeru najemne opcije, pri kateri so določbe najema same po sebi zadostne za utemeljitev te opcije. Opcija samo ustvarja pogodbeno pravico; ne daje opciojemalcu nobene nepremičnine v nepremičnini. V času podpisa opcije lastnik ne proda nepremičnine, niti kupec ne kupi nepremičnine. Čeprav je lastnik dolžan prodati, če ga kupec obvesti, kupec ni dolžan kupiti. Možnost nakupa je znana tudi kot klic; možnost prodaje je znana kot pot. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Prednosti karotenoidov za kožo<br/><br/>Ste že slišali za karotenoide? Te močne fitokemikalije so pigmentirane sestavine, ki jih najdemo v rastlinah, ki dajejo cvetje, sadje in puščajo svoje rumene, oranžne in rdeče barve.<br/><br/>Od tridesetih let prejšnjega stoletja so znanstveniki identificirali približno 800 karotenoidov in približno 40 jih najdemo v človeškem telesu, vključno z zunanjo plastjo povrhnjice, usnjice in podkožne maščobe. Najpogostejši karotenoidi so beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaksantin, likopen in astaksantin. Več o astaksantinu lahko preberete tukaj.<br/><br/>Na vsebnost karotenoidov v koži vplivajo številni dejavniki, vključno z vnosom sadja in zelenjave, njihovo biološko uporabnostjo iz različnih živil, prehranskimi dopolnili, izpostavljenostjo UV-žarkom, onesnaženostjo zraka, uživanjem alkohola, kajenjem in stresom.<br/><br/>Kako karotenoidi pomagajo koži?<br/><br/>Karotenoidi so nekateri od najbolj znanih antioksidantov za kožo in imajo tudi pomembne funkcije kot protivnetna sredstva.<br/><br/>Zdravo staranje in popravilo kože<br/><br/>Antioksidanti so bistvenega pomena za zdravo kožo, saj pomagajo preprečiti poškodbe prostih radikalov v celicah. Poškodbe prostih radikalov povzroča prezgodnje staranje in pojav različnih vrst kožnega raka. Karotenoidi, skupaj z vitaminom E, vitaminom C in Co encimom Q10, so pomembni dermalni antioksidanti.<br/><br/>Zaradi svoje antioksidativne aktivnosti karotenoidi podpirajo in spodbujajo proizvodnjo kolagena in elastina v koži. To pomaga povečati gostoto, debelino, elastičnost in čvrstost kože. Kolagen in elastin se zmanjšujeta, ko se staramo, zato je pridobivanje dovolj karotenoidov v prehrani in lokalno ključnega pomena za dobro staranje.<br/><br/>Karotenoidi lahko izboljšajo znake fotostaranja, spremembo barve kože, elastičnost, vlaženje, teksturo in lahko zmanjšajo transepidermalno izgubo vode.<br/><br/>Astaksantin zlasti stimulira fibroblaste za proizvodnjo kolagena in elastina, zavira aktivnost encimov, ki razgrajujejo kolagen in elastin, ter kaže protivnetne in UV-filtrirne učinke. Pokazalo se je, da zmanjšuje melanin v koži, kar ima za posledico zmanjšanje videza peg in melazme.<br/><br/>Anti-akne aktivnost: protivnetno delovanje karotenoidov pomaga ublažiti vnetje in draženje, povezano z aknami. Karotenoidi pomagajo tudi normalizirati in uravnotežiti oljne izločke iz lojnic. So dragocena sredstva pri popravljanju kože in spodbujajo regeneracijo povrhnjice ter pomagajo zgladiti in zmehčati kožo.<br/><br/>Kje lahko najdem karotenoide?<br/><br/>Obstajata dva načina, da bi dobili svoj dnevni odmerek karotenoidov: s prehrano in z lokalno uporabo. Kombinacija obeh je idealen pristop k dobro staranje kože.<br/><br/>Karotenoidi so topni v maščobah, zato vaše telo potrebuje maščobe, da jih absorbira (mislite na paradižnik in oljčno olje, brokoli in maslo ali špinačo in avokado). Pogosti viri karotenoidov v hrani so avokado, jajčni rumenjaki, zelje, špinača, korenje, sladki krompir, papaja in paradižnik.<br/><br/>Medtem ko se zavzemamo za pridobivanje čim več hranilnih snovi in antioksidantov, kot jih lahko iz hrane, namesto dopolnitev; ena študija je pokazala, da je astaksantin v kombinaciji s kolagenom hidrolizat bistveno izboljšal integriteto pregrade, zmanjšal transepidermalno izgubo vode in povečal izražanje prokolagena tipa I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topična uporaba je ključna za zdravo kožo. Študije kažejo, da visoke koncentracije antioksidantov v človeški koži zagotavljajo najboljšo zaščito za zdravo kožo v kateri koli starosti.<br/><br/>V Sarka Botanicals mešamo karotenoidno bogate cele rastline, kot so ognjič, regrat in izvlečki, kot je astaksantin, s hladno stiskanimi olji in funkcionalnimi sestavinami. Samo ognjič vsebuje več kot 19 različnih vrst karotenoidov. Raziskave kažejo, da so karotenoidi, mešani s koencimom Q10, še posebej učinkoviti pri zmanjševanju vnetja in upočasnitvi prezgodnjega staranja kože zaradi izpostavljenosti soncu. |
