| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Medtem ko priznavamo, da je nemogoče ugovarjati nekomu, da ljubi nekaj, kar sovraži, in obratno, je še vedno pogosto prijetno poskusiti argument. Ko se pogovarjamo z ljudmi, katerih mnenja so v neposrednem nasprotju z našimi, smo prisiljeni braniti svoje okuse, definirati svoja mnenja in analizirati, zakaj reagiramo tako, kot to počnemo.

Ker ne glede na to, kaj govori radio, še vedno obstaja srednja točka med "Popolnoma se strinjava" in "Jaz imam prav, in ti si neumen in zloben."<br/><br/>Scott: Odkar smo razpravljali o mojem Scott Pilgrim vs. World odpadništvo, smo iskali primer, kjer vas lahko pokličem, ker vam ni všeč nekaj čudovitega, in nam ni bilo treba dolgo iskati. Sedeli smo drug ob drugem med filmom Martina Scorseseja Hugo – jaz, popolnoma očarani nad njegovim fantastičnim poklonom čudesom zgodnjega nemega filma, in ti, ki se mu očitno upiraš na vsakem koraku. Kritično soglasje je bilo na moji strani: dosegel je 9. mesto na našem kolektivnem Top 15 (čeprav ste ga navedli kot vašo Precenjeno izbiro), osvojil (ali uvrstil) v različnih filmsko-kritičnih nagradah in trenutno uživa 83 točk na Metacritic. To seveda ne pomeni, da se motite, vendar je na vas, da pojasnite, zakaj je bil Hugo, po vaših besedah, "votli in umetni", kjer so ga mnogi od nas videli kot čudovit priklic Scorsesejevega otroštva in medija, ko je bil še v otroštvu. In prosim, bodite nežni, ko boste raztrgali tega metulja narazen za krila.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Tasha: Ne morem biti nežna, Scott. Včasih boli manj, če odtrgaš obliž naenkrat. (In tudi če ne, kdo želi hoditi naokoli z napol odtrganim obližem? Grozno.) Dejstvo je, da sem ugotovil, da je Hugo utrujajoče manipulativna vaja v ponarejanju, začenši z odpiranjem drsenja skozi pariško železniško postajo, ki me je bolj kot karkoli spominjala na Polar Express Roberta Zemeckisa. Za razliko od Mikea D'Angela sem ljubitelj dolgega, neprekinjenega prostora in spodbujam gledalce, da nezavedno zadržijo dih, ko kamera raziskuje območje; ko pa je prostor, ki se raziskuje, gladka, sijoča CGI kreacija in kamera plava brez teže skozi to brez fizičnega občutka, da je kamera ali okolica resnično tam, da se nekdo začne gledati video. In preostanek filma se mi je zdel enako neporen in nerealen, tako v smislu postavitve kot tudi v smislu njegove zelo izmišljene, maudlin zgodbe.<br/><br/>Ni nujno, da imam problem z izdelanimi, stiliziranimi okolji v filmu. Všeč mi je bil prav tako razširjen, popolnoma umetni posnetek Baza Luhrmanna o Parizu v Moulin Rougeu, na primer, ampak ta film ima občutek lastne smešnosti, smisel za humor o tem, kako namerno over-the-top je. K stilizaciji Jean-Pierra Jeuneta, zlasti v Amélie. (Tu sta se Jeunet in Luhrmann počutila kot močan vizualni vpliv.) Imam pa občutek, da je Martin Scorsese želel, da Huga jemljem povsem resno. Čeprav je to še ena boleča, sentimentalna zgodba o pogumnem siroti, ki vnaša barve v življenje mrzlega starca.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Ničesar v filmu ne uživam bolj kot presenečenje in nič ne zamerim in se upiram bolj kot to, da me odkrito manipulirajo, da mi glasno govorijo, kaj naj čutim in kdaj naj čutim. Dober film naredi tovrstne stvari subtilno; slaba uporablja razbijajoče glasbene namige in sladke strune - in v tem primeru grdo, ogromno-oči, raztrgano siroto, ki žalostno strmi v kamero - da zahteva patos in gledalcem pove, da so grozni ljudje, če ga ne služijo na zahtevo. To je dejal, da se lahko spopadem z žalostnimi otroki in mrzlimi odraslimi, ki delajo življenje boljše drug za drugega - res sem izkopal letošnji Le Havre, ki je bil v bistvu enak zaplet brez vse srčkanosti - vendar se mi zdi, da se umetna okolja slabo odražajo na umetna čustva in vsaka naredi drugo bolj ponarejeno.<br/><br/>V našem spregledanem videoposnetku sta s Noelom odpeljala Keitha za zagovornika tiranozavra, ker se vam je zdelo, da ni dovolj realistično - preveč izmišljeno, preveč bedno, preveč, preveč daleč. Kako je mogoče, da ne morete kupiti starega, ki razbija stvari, ko je jezen, lahko pa kupite siroto, ki živi v veliki uri na železniški postaji in se odpravi na muhasto potovanje, da popravi skrivnostni avtomat, za katerega verjame, da lahko nosi skrivnosti od svojega mrtvega očeta, ki pa ga namesto tega vodi na čudaško potovanje samoodkrivanja, v čarobno deželo filma? Ali niste nikoli našli Hugovega rokoko dizajna, agresivnega srčnega vrvca ali obremenitve vozička, ki je celo malo pretirana ali težko pogoltnjena?<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet in Luhrmann kot vplivata na Scorseseja?! Pozabite, da ste brezobzirni, zdaj me namerno udarjate z ostro palico. Če iščete navdih za Huga - če iščete čustveno jedro Huga - se morate vrniti v Scorsesejevo otroštvo na Elizabeth Street v Mali Italiji, kjer se je astmatični deček, ki se ni mogel igrati zunaj z drugimi otroki, umaknil v fantazije Alexander Korda, kot je The Thief Of Bagdad. Ali, bolj preprosto, pojdite naravnost k samemu viru: George Méliès, katerega potovanje na Luno ostaja Veliki pok vseh filmskih fantazij, tisti trenutek, ko kamera ni bila uporabljena za dokumentiranje sveta, kot je, ampak kar koli je muhasto, čarobno, transportno mesto, ki ga želi filmski ustvarjalec izumiti za to. In ta tradicija je bila razvita in razširjena desetletja, preden sta Jeunet in Luhrmann dobila svoje drobne tačke na njej.<br/><br/>In ko že govorimo o Jeunetu, lep poskus, da bi mi odvzel retorično orožje, toda vseeno bom rekel: kako lahko ljubiš Amélie, pa se ti zdi Hugo sintetičen in "prekomerno" in "naveličano manipulativen"? Pravite, da imata Amélie in Moulin Rouge odkupni "občutek lastne smešnosti", kjer Scorsese pomeni, da Huga jemljemo resno, in mislim, da to ni tako, vsaj glede slednje točke. Da Scorsese čuti očitno strast do filmov, je, predvidevam, razlog, zakaj bi interpretirali Huga kot samo-resnega, toda zame so ti občutki tisti, ki dajejo filmu čustveno balast, ki ga filmi Luhrmann in Jeunet nimajo. Vsi trije filmi agresivno uporabljajo čudeže CGI - in Scorsese dodaja 3D mešanici, za čudovit učinek - vendar se ti in jaz razlikujeva glede vprašanja breztežnosti. Strinjam se, da ima CGI distančni učinek; svetovi, ki so v celoti sestavljeni iz digitalnega plastelina, so tako prilagodljivi, da včasih nimajo prisotnosti. Huga ste omenili v svojem vnosu "Overrated" za naš najboljši filmski del kot "CGI gimcrack" - popoln dis ... za drug film.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Pošteno je reči, da je Scorsese zgradil Huga okoli standardne izdaje otroške knjige / filmske ploskve: sirota pogreša svojega očeta, ustvari svoj majhen domišljijski svet, najde novega prijatelja, prepriča hrustljavega starega fuddy-duddyja, da se zmehča in ga morda posvoji. Toda to je samo pripovedni okostnjak, Scorsese pa zagotavlja veliko mesa in krvi. Prvič, ne morete gledati Huga, osamljenega fanta, ki gleda od stolpov z uro do vrveža pariške železniške postaje, ne da bi pomislili na Scorseseja, še enega osamljenega fanta, ki strmi skozi okno svoje spalnice na Elizabeth Street. In tudi če nisi dovolj velik filmski piflar, da bi vzpostavil to povezavo, res čutim, da Hugovo potovanje ni v iskanju nove očetovske figure, ampak v vztrajanju z mehansko čarovnijo, ki stoji kot zapuščina njegovega lastnega očeta. Vztrajnost vizije, ki nam omogoča, da sprejmemo iluzorno različico sveta pri 24 sličicah na sekundo, je znanost in magija hkrati. Hugov odnos z Mélièsom ne gre za to, da se je udoben do novega očeta, ampak za skupno navdušenje, ki ga je starec potopil v grenkobo.<br/><br/>Zdi se, da je celo nekaj kritikov filma pripravljeno priznati, da so zaporedja, ki spominjajo na zgodovino filma in Mélièsov studio - z Michaelom Stuhlbargom kot junaškim filmskim učenjakom! - odlična. Počutil sem se, na najboljši možni način, kot obilno stiskanje mojega razreda Zgodovina filma 101 na kolidžu, zgoščevanje semestra vrednega posnetkov in konteksta v nekaj med montažo in animirano pop-up knjigo. In govori o genialni zasnovi filma, ki tako lepo prepleta dejstvo in fantazijo, da je hkrati zgodovina Mélièsa in rojstvo filma, in samo neke vrste preprosto, razkošno proizvedeno filmsko čudež, ki bi ga Scorsese sam ljubil kot otrok. Hvala bogu, da Hugo ne sledi modelu Jeunet/Luhrmann in ima "občutek lastne smešnosti". Kot poznavalec fantazije, ali ne bi rekli, da je vredno igrati naravnost in resno in brez zadrego, namesto da bi pomežiknili občinstvu? Morda se vam zdi Hugo boleče srčkan, vendar menim, da pristnosti njegovih občutkov ni treba zanikati.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Tasha: Da, dejansko sem našel dele Huga očarljivo. (Opazite, kako sem odgovoril na vaše vprašanje vnaprej, medtem ko si bil preveč zaposlen penjenje z apopleksijo, da bi se obrnil na moje, čeprav predvidevam, da je odgovor sam po sebi. Ok, "vpliv" je lahko pretiravanje primera - sem mislil, da je vizualni slog videti zelo znano. Čeprav, kot je Keith poudaril, ko ste to osebno omenili, Scorsese ne nasprotuje črpanju navdiha iz tujih vizualov, niti ni imun na to.) Predvsem so me očarali deli, ki se ukvarjajo z zgodbo Georgesa Mélièsa, z njegovo ljubeznijo do filma, delom, ki ga je vložil v svojo umetnost, in veseljem, ki ga je dobil iz nje. V uprizoritvi podvodne scene iz Mélièsove "Fairyland" je ogromno lepote in zabave, v zaporedju na koncu pa se osredotoča na posnetke Méliès. Priznam, da je Hugov odnos z Mélièsom zaradi skupne ljubezni do filma lep dotik in uživam v dobrem filmu o filmskem ustvarjanju.<br/><br/>Toda Hugo ne gre predvsem za film, kljub Mélièsovim povezavam. Poleg tem, ki jih navajate, gre tudi za iskanje vašega namena, kot liki izrecno, naporno pojasnjujejo drug drugemu in nam. In gre za spektakel, in velike akcijske setpieces, in lov, in srečno-vedno-po-konci, kjer tudi jezni nasilnež in sramežljiv starejši par in fergawdsakes celo pokvarjen jazbec dobili par off s očarljivimi ljubezenskimi interesi do konca. Gre za to, da je super prezgodaj zrela Hermiona Granger, da je šefinja, razdražljiva, pametna in hvali čarobne svetove v knjigah, vse to pa je zelo znano in zelo umetno.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese se igra z arhetipi. Problem je v tem, da nikoli nisem čutil, da jih je prežel z ničemer novim, svežim ali verodostojnim, kljub svoji lastni zgodbi. Bolj bi mi bila všeč zgodba o mladem Scorseseju, ki odrašča z astmo – nekaj majhnega in resničnega, brez velikih prostorov, polnih CGI mehanskih mehanizmov in zlatih žarečih prašnih motorjev in preroških sanj ter besnega odraslega tiranina-varuha z zlatim srcem – vse to preveliko, over-the-top nesmisel. Navajate Scorsesejevo osebno ozadje in ljubezen do filma kot dokaz, da resnično čuti, kar daje na zaslon, vendar v tem ne čutim njegovega osebnega dotika, razen trenutkov, ki so izrecno povezani s filmom. Jedro čustev je lahko resnično, vendar to ne pomeni, da je usmrtitev manj lažna.<br/><br/>Pravite, da pristnosti čustev ni mogoče zanikati. Ne dvomim, ali se je Scorsese osebno počutil osamljenega in izoliranega kot otrok, vendar na zaslonu ne čutim osamljenosti in osamljenosti - vidim kup pretiranih označevalcev (Hugo je umazan in njegova oblačila so oblečena in vsi odrasli kričijo nanj in ga redno preganja strašen pes!) in velike utripe, z jokom in jokanjem in Spielbergian. Zame je iskrenost bolj prepričljiva in osebna, ko je tiho in neposredno; ko nekdo kriči name, predvidevam, da je bodisi zelo jezen ali pa samo poskuša preplaviti moje čute, da bi mi preprečil izražanje lastnega mnenja. Hugo je bil dolg krik, kar se mene tiče.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Zakaj nisem dobil tistega lažnega občutka od Amélie? Popolnoma priznam, da sta Amélie in Moulin Rouge tako velika, manipulativna, umetna konstrukcija v istem duhu, ki zahteva določena čustva v določenih intervalih in poskuša ta čustva prodati s težkimi čustvi in agresivnim soundtrackom. Nihče od njih mi ni prodal svojih čustev kot pristnih človeških čustev. Kar sem užival v teh dveh filmih je bila gradnja - še posebej Amélie je ošabna, smešne sezname naključnih značilnosti in doživetij za njeno igralsko postavo, in Moulin Rouge je glasbeno-magpie mashups in recontextualizations. Pogosto me prodajajo na zgodbah, ki ustvarjajo ali ambiciozne stvari s strukturo, in oba ta filma se kvalificirata, kjer je Hugo veliko bolj linearna, standardna otroška iskanja.<br/><br/>Ampak na koncu, zame, se res spusti na občutek, da so ti filmi bedaki, medtem ko je Hugo mišljeno, da se jemlje resno v vsakem treakly trenutku. Ne mislite, da je to res - vendar hkrati branite njeno integriteto v smislu absolutno avtentičnih, zakoreninjenih čustev v zgodovini Scorseseja in mi govorite, da se motim, in to ne pomeni, da ga je treba jemati resno. Kaj pa film, ki vam nakazuje, da ga ne bi smeli jemati po nominalni vrednosti? In ali je možno, da je to samo še en radoveden primer Benjamina Buttona, kjer menim, da je uporaba otrok v velikih proračunskih filmih v veliki meri slaba in melodramatična, medtem ko vi kot oče menite, da to zaobide vaš cinizem in gre naravnost v vaš družinski občutek?<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Nisem prepričan, da sem mislil, da Scorsese ne pomeni, da ga je treba jemati resno; to je samo, da je izbral muhasto vozilo, s katerim izraža resno ljubezen do filmov. Ko rečeš, "Toda Hugo ne gre predvsem za film, kljub Mélièsovim povezavam," sem zmedena. Priznavam, da se vam zdijo mnogi elementi Huga preveč znani in naporni in polni Spielbergovih čudežnih čustev - nič ne morem storiti, da bi se prepiral okoli tega dojemanja, ki ga delijo drugi dvomljivci Huga. Včasih film pomeni očarati in očarati, za nekatere pa ne; imate Huga in imam Amélie, čeprav mislim, da slednji, namerno umetni, pomeni, da je romantičen. (Namesto, recimo, neke grozne mehanske izmišljotine, primerne za nadaljevanje žage.)<br/><br/>Če ne gre za film, potem je to najbolj nesmiselna diskurzivna zgodba, kar sem jih kdaj videl. Odnos med Hugom in Mélièsom je srce filma in v središču tega ni le neka stock povezava med Plucky Orphan in Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, ampak skupna afiniteta za inženirsko magijo - še posebej čarobnost filmov. Mislim, da so Scorsese in njegovi sodelavci našli način, kako izraziti svoje navdušenje nad zgodnjimi dnevi kinematografije skozi fantazijo, ki je dostopna vsem starostnim skupinam. Otroška zgodba, napolnjena z arhetipi, je tu le skorja; kino je pita. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Kar se tiče čudnega primera Benjamina Buttona, ne vidim veliko povezave, razen tega, da bi me poskušali razkriti kot zagovornika Benjamina Buttona kot način, da bi poškodovali mojo verodostojnost. (Mimogrede, kako so dodatki na tem G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Povedal sem ti, da je novi oče, ki je prikrajšan za spanje v meni, morda ranljiv za Benjamina Buttona, toda ne morem si predstavljati časa, ko me predpostavka staranja v obratnem položaju ne bi premaknila. Kako to ne vpliva na vas?) In poleg tega, ne vidim, kako Benjamin Button veliko poveže s Hugom kot filmom o otrocih, saj je to le majhen del zgodbe, ki se razteza na veliko širši poti.<br/><br/>Sem vas prepričal? Verjetno ne. Toda vesel sem, da Hugo ni bil popolnoma brez očaranja za vas. Sekvence na Méliès režiserja so tisto, kar je Hugo zame - in v tem, vsaj, lahko delimo nekaj filmske ljubezni.<br/><br/>Oglaševanje<br/><br/>Tasha: Ne, ne morem reči, da si me prepričal, tako kot sem prepričal tebe. Nemogoče je ugovarjati komurkoli v visceralno ljubezen do česarkoli, prav tako pa bi moralo biti prav tako nemogoče nekoga pregovoriti v visceralno ljubezen. Predvsem ste mi dovolili videti Huga v Scott-O-Vision, kar je zanimiva izkušnja; vsaj zdaj sem rahlo prepričan, da nam nekako ni uspelo videti popolnoma različnih filmov, ki so imeli nekako isto ime in režiserja.<br/><br/>Vsekakor pa smo imeli različne izkušnje in po mojem mnenju smo se osredotočili na različne vidike produkcije: še vedno ne vidim teme "film je čudovit" kot enojni verigi filma, toliko kot ena med preveč. "Nepomembno diskurzivno" ga skoraj pokriva, čeprav bi na vrhu tega vrgel "pogosto nepotrebno srčkan in dragocen". Medtem ko ste osredotočeni na okusno polnjenje pite filma, se mi zdi, da je bila ta pita prekrita s kilogramom kristaliziranega sladkorja in mislim, da to naredi razliko, ne glede na osrednje sporočilo filma ali peščico čudovitih prizorov. Glej tudi Benjamin Button, ki ga nisem omenil samo zato, da bi vas dražil - res mislim, da imate bolj sentimentalno vrsto kot jaz glede otrok v kinu, še posebej, ko se uporabljajo bolj kot simboli ranljivosti in nedolžnosti kot kot človeški liki. Hej, veš, kateri film sploh nima srčkanih širokookih lutk, ki prinašajo upanje v ciničen svet? G.I. Joe: Vzpon Cobre. Mogoče bom šel gledat tiste Blu-ray dodatke. Lahko bi uporabil nekaj eksplozivnega insulina, da bi nadomestil Hugovo sladkost. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Upala sem, da bo moja hči osvobojena težkih in težavnih časov": zgodba Mee Mee kot begunska mama<br/><br/>Upanje v času krize: Zgodba o materinem dnevu<br/><br/>Avtor: Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee je slišala, da prihajajo vojaki. Zgrabila je svojega sina in se besno pridružila preostalim vaščanom, ki so tekali proti tajsko-burmanski meji, kjer se je nahajal Urad visokega komisarja Združenih narodov za begunce (UNHCR). Njen mož je bil v drugi vasi, ki je tekel v nasprotni smeri, kot se je kasneje naučila Mee. Ko se je preganjanje vojakov končalo, se je Mee vrnila domov v svojo majhno vas v Koechiju v Burmi.<br/><br/>Med letoma 1997 in 2000 so Mee in tisoči, kot je ona, živeli pod nenehno grožnjo nasilja burmanskih vojakov. Mnogi ljudje bi se začasno zatekli v džunglo in se vrnili domov v svojo vas, potem ko so vojaki zapustili območje, samo da bi to storili nekaj dni kasneje. Približno enkrat na teden so bili Mee in drugi na poti, da bi se izognili ujetju, posilstvu ali smrti vojakov.<br/><br/>Med enim incidentom je Meein mož stekel pred svojo ženo, da bi priskrbel hrano za svojo družino. Njen mož so opazili vojaki in ga ustrelili. Krogla je razbila del njegove rebrne kletke, zaradi česar je bil hudo ranjen in v stiski, ko je potoval proti džungli s svojo družino zaradi varnosti.<br/><br/>Tri mesece se je Meein mož skrival in premikal družino z razburljivo rano ob strani. Ni dobil nobene medicinske oskrbe, razen Meeine skrbi.<br/><br/>»Bala sem se vrniti v Burmo,« je rekla Mee prek tolmača. »Bala sem se smrti. Vsak dan sem jokala in jokala,« je nadaljevala.<br/><br/>Meejin mož je na koncu pridobil dovolj moči, da je pet dni hodil proti majhni vasici na Tajskem, kjer so izvedeli za lokacijo bolnišnice in begunskega taborišča. Ko sta Mee in njen mož končno prispela v bolnišnico, je bil nemudoma operiran in kasneje okreval.<br/><br/>Simbol upanja<br/><br/>Življenje v džungli za tiste, ki so bežali burmanski vojaki, je bilo resnično grozljivo in težko. Izmišljeni šotori iz bambusa s samo streho in talne obloge so postali primerna začasna stanovanja. Mnoge ženske, vključno z Mee, so rodile otroke v džungli. Meejev takrat šestletni sin je pomagal pri porodu svoje sestre Eh Ku Hser. Njeno ime pomeni ljubezen - hladno - sladko. "Mrzlo" v burmanski kulturi pomeni, da ne gredo skozi ogenj življenja, saj vročina predstavlja težavne čase.<br/><br/>"Upala sem, da bo moja hči osvobojena težkih in težavnih časov," je dejala Mee. "Nisem želela, da bi šla skozi to, kar sem doživela," je nadaljevala.<br/><br/>Za Mee je bilo rojstvo njene hčerke sredi teme, mučenja in strahu simbol upanja za prihodnje življenje. Upanje v času krize, sama predpostavka Združenega metodističnega odbora za pomoč (UMCOR), ki je na novo pod blagovno znamko UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, je tudi bistvo tistega, na kar sveče razsvetljujejo.<br/><br/>Nov začetek<br/><br/>S pomočjo UNHCR se je upanje za novo življenje resnično uresničilo za Mee in njeno družino, ko so se preselili v West Springfield v Massachusettsu. Tam je Mee spoznala Moo Kho Paw, drugo žensko, ki je emigrirala iz Burme in ki je delala v Prosperity Candle v Firencah. Organizacija pomaga begunkam, ki so pobegnile iz konfliktnih območij, obnoviti svoje življenje z umetnostjo izdelave sveč. Moo Kho je priporočil, naj se Mee pridruži organizaciji, in Mee je z veseljem sprejel.<br/><br/>"Bila sem navdušena, da sem zunaj hiše," je dejala Mee, "sem bila vzgojena, da verjamem, da je moja vloga, ker sem ženska, ostati doma in vzgajati svojo družino. "Medtem ko mnoge burmanske ženske želijo storiti več zase, jih pogosto spodbujajo, da ostanejo gospodinje."<br/><br/>Danes Mee načrtuje, da bo sama začela izdelovati sveče in podpirala svojih pet otrok, vendar je najprej izrazila potrebo po učenju angleščine.<br/><br/>"V tajskem begunskem taborišču smo imeli izobrazbo, vendar ni bilo tako dobro," je dejala Mee. "Ko sem bila otrok, sem želela iti v šolo, vendar so mi rekli, naj ostanem doma, ker sem ženska. Zdaj upam, da bodo moje hčerke šle na kolidž in postale zdravniki ali policistke," je nadaljevala Mee.<br/><br/>Mee je v svojem življenju dosegla ravnovesje, ki si ga želi, da bi ga našli drugi – preprosto, srečno življenje, v katerem delo, skrb za družinske člane in svoboda izbire imajo svoje mesto.<br/><br/>Podpora beguncem v ZDA<br/><br/>Delite to zgodbo o materinem dnevu s svojimi najdražjimi. In ko kupite ročno izdelane sveče Mee, Moo Kho in Naw, druge burmanske begunce, ki delajo v Prosperity Candle, veste, da pomagate podpirati njihovo preživetje, ko obnovijo svoje življenje in življenje svojih družinskih članov v ZDA. |
| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

At the end of the prologue Bradstreet writes, "Let Greeks be Greeks, and woman what they are; Men have precedency and still excel, It is but vain unjustly to wage war; Men can do best, and women know it well."<br/>Bradstreet's tone seems to be sincere, but a hint of humor and sarcasm also lurks between the verses. This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Precedenčni esej<br/><br/>1562 besed - 7 strani<br/><br/>Pritrdilno ukrepanje je vladna politika, ki daje priložnosti manjšinam, ženskam in vsem skupinam, ki so bile v preteklosti žrtve diskriminacije. Pritrdilna akcija je rezultat gibanja za državljanske pravice iz leta 1960, ki izhaja iz zakona o državljanskih pravicah iz leta 1964, ki je prepovedal diskriminacijo na podlagi rase, etnične pripadnosti ali spola. To je bila odločitev vrhovnega sodišča iz leta 1978, The Regents of the University of California proti Bakke, ki je omogočila uporabo rasnih preferenc kot sredstva za spodbujanje raznolikosti, kar je omogočilo uporabo pritrdilnih ukrepov v politikah sprejema. Ustvarjen je bil z namenom zagotavljanja enakih možnosti za pripadnike manjšinskih skupin v izobraževanju in izobraževanju.<br/><br/>Vendar pa se je glede na poročilo Raziskovalnega centra Pew iz leta 2007 podpora za pritrdilno ukrepanje med ameriško javnostjo v zadnjih letih bistveno povečala, z 58 % leta 1995 na 70 % leta 2007. Zagovorniki afirmativne akcije imajo veliko argumentov v podporo afirmativni akciji, v upanju, da bodo drugi videli pristno dobro, ki ga afirmativne akcijske politike prinašajo naši družbi. Podporniki menijo, da je pritrdilno ukrepanje bolj proces kot politika sprejema. Kolegiji in univerze prevzamejo dodatno pobudo, da dosežejo manjšinske skupine in jih spodbujajo, da se prijavijo. Kolegiji in univerze ponujajo dodatno finančno pomoč in zagotavljajo vire na kampusu, da bi izboljšali izobraževanje študentov. Podporniki opozarjajo tudi na naraščajoče število manjšinskih vlog na fakultetah in univerzah, deloma zaradi politik pritrdilnih ukrepov.<br/>Statistike so pokazale, da ko je afirmativno ukrepanje odpravljeno, na primer, ko je bilo leta 1998 na Berkley College in UCLA, se je sprejem manjšinskih študentov zmanjšal za 61 odstotkov in 36 odstotkov, kar dokazuje, da ima afirmativno ukrepanje glavno vlogo v procesu sprejemanja manjšinskih študentov na kolidž. Zagovorniki afirmativnih ukrepov prav tako verjamejo, da raznolikost v visokošolskem izobraževanju zagotavlja boljše izobraževalno vzdušje za vse študente, tako osebno kot intelektualno. Če bi odpravili pritrdilne ukrepe, bi bilo manj manjšinskih študentov vpisanih na kolidže, zaradi česar bi bila raznolikost precej tanka. Politike afirmativnih ukrepov so potrebne tudi za nadomestilo za stoletja rasnega, gospodarskega in družbenega zatiranja. Posamezniki z višjim socialno-ekonomskim statusom imajo več priložnosti kot tisti z nižjim socialno-ekonomskim ozadjem. Podporniki menijo, da so nekatere rasne ali etnične skupine prikrajšane, ker so pogosto v gospodinjstvih z nižjimi dohodki in zato niso izpostavljene enakim virom kot študenti višjih socialno-ekonomskih razredov. Zagovorniki podpirajo pojem konkurence med študenti, ki temelji na zaslugah, vendar trdijo, da afirmativno ukrepanje kompenzira ekonomske razlike. Diplomanti, ki so imeli koristi od afirmativnih ukrepov, so prav tako povedali, da so dobili boljša delovna mesta, zaslužili več denarja in na splošno živijo boljše življenje zaradi srečnih priložnosti, ki so jih prejeli s afirmativnimi ukrepi.<br/>Zagovorniki afirmativnih ukrepov nenehno poudarjajo velik pomen afirmativnih ukrepov, saj prispevajo k izboljšanju izkušenj kolegija in družbe na splošno. Vendar pa nasprotniki afirmativne akcije verjamejo, da je prišel čas, da se konča afirmativna akcija. Nasprotniki verjamejo, da je bila afirmativna akcija ustvarjena, da bi zagotovila poštene prakse sprejema, da bi spremembo v dolgo obdobje rasne diskriminacije. Verjamejo, da je politika zastarela.« Čas je, da umaknemo dirkalno odločanje,« pravi Ward Connerly, kalifornijski poslovnež in vodilni organizator...<br/><br/>Poiščite še en esej o predpostavki<br/><br/>Čeprav je Jackson ustvaril in podpisal vse za indijski zakon o odstranitvi, zakon ne bi začel veljati šele po Jacksonovem predhodniku.<br/>Zamisel o nacionalni banki je bila v 1800-ih v ameriškem jeziku nov predlog.

Ona piše: "Naj bodo Grki Grki, in ženske, kar so / Moški, so predhodnice in še vedno odlikujejo ... prednost v vsem in vsak je vaš..." (36-41).

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Kombinacije<br/><br/>Kombinacije so obrambe pred udarcem, koreografirani odzivi na različne vrste napadov. Imajo veliko imen po borilnih veščinah, vendar (po mojih izkušnjah) vsaka umetnost ima njihovo različico. To jih razlikuje od oblik, ker obstaja veliko borilnih veščin, ki nimajo oblik. Kaj naredi partnerske vaje tako univerzalne? Zakaj vaditi določen odziv, ko (v resnici) čas, vrsta napada, velikost napadalca in sto drugih dejavnikov bo to, tako da nikoli ne uporabite celotnega koreografiranega odziva? In končno, kako lahko treniramo za pravo obrambno situacijo in se hkrati izognemo poškodbam?<br/><br/>Univerzalnost kombinacij je impresivna. Naš slog Kenpo karateja ima seznam 108 kombinacij, ki jih je mogoče naučiti. (Večina študentov se nauči le 20-30, čeprav) V brazilskem jiu-jitsu preživite cele razrede, ki vadite palice in zadušitve, učenje vsake subtilnosti pri gibanju, medtem ko vaš partner ponuja malo ali nič odpora. Vsak boksar je porabil ure pred vrečko in / ali ogledalom, ki je vrgel isto kombinacijo udarcev, dokler se njegovo telo ne premika samo z refleksom. Kombinacije so univerzalne, ker nimamo boljšega načina, da uvedemo gibanje in nato vadi subtilne položaje, potrebne za njihovo delovanje. Zadetek majhne tlačne točke skozi oblačila vzame veliko prakse, ulov palice z nadzorom zahteva skrbno postavljen kolk in zahrbtno nastavitev, odlična kombinacija pa je uporabna le, če jo lahko prebrodite iz uravnoteženega in zaščitenega položaja. Si lahko predstavljate kakšen boljši način za pridobitev teh veščin?<br/><br/>Obstajajo številni dejavniki, ki določajo, kako se odzovete na napad in ali v sparing tekmi ali v boju NIKOLI nisem uporabil popolne kombinacije v svojo obrambo. Zakaj potem porabimo ure za njihovo vadbo? Vadi te koreografirane odgovore, ker cilj ni, da izvlečete kombinacijo 8 iz vsakič, ko vidite kavelj udarec, ampak da vam pokažemo en način, da ga blokirate in nato možni način, da mu sledite. Nikoli se nisem odločil za uporabo kombinacije 3 v realnosti, vendar je blok eden od mojih go-to potez. Kombinacije dodati orodja v škatlo z orodji, ki jih ne popraviti avto.<br/><br/>Zadnje vprašanje je vprašanje varnosti. Če vadimo zaradi resničnosti, moramo posnemati resničnost. Kako preprečiti poškodbe, medtem ko to počnemo? Ko gre za to, gre za gradnjo zaupanja. Začnemo počasi in se naučimo zaupati, da imamo nadzor nad seboj. Naučimo se zaupati tudi našim partnerjem. V več časa se naučimo zaupati našemu nadzoru nad našim partnerjem in (malo strašljivejše) se naučimo zaupati nadzoru našega partnerja nad nami. Na koncu (z veliko prakse) se lahko premaknete so polna hitrost, vrgel svojega partnerja, in vrgli brez strahu pred poškodbami.<br/><br/>Kombinacije so univerzalne z razlogom; izvajajo se tako, da jih je mogoče razdeliti na njihove dele, in ostanemo varni s počasnim začetkom in gradnjo zaupanja. Kot pri vsem drugem v borilnih veščinah imajo kombinacije veliko razlogov za svojo prakso in izvedbo. |
